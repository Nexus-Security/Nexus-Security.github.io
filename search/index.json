[{"content":"In today\u0026rsquo;s world, who couldn\u0026rsquo;t benefit from additional internet speed? Websites, software, and files continue to grow larger, but unfortunately, technology budgets haven\u0026rsquo;t kept pace. Imagine doubling your internet speed without increasing your current expenses – an appealing proposition, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t you agree?\nIt might sound illogical to suggest that doubling your internet speed wouldn\u0026rsquo;t cost more, especially since internet providers aren\u0026rsquo;t known for giving things away for free. The secret lies in adopting newer, more cost-effective technology instead of simply replacing your existing service with an identical one from another provider.\nOne way to double your internet speed with your current or a new provider, while retaining your T1 line service, is to order a second T1 line and \u0026ldquo;bond\u0026rdquo; it with your existing line. Bonding combines two lines to function as a single, faster line. A single T1 line provides 1.5 Mbps, so bonding two lines results in a speed of 3 Mbps. However, there are a couple of limitations. First, both T1 lines must be from the same provider, either your current one or a new one for both lines. Second, your monthly cost will double since you\u0026rsquo;re now paying for two lines. While you might find a different vendor offering lower prices for the same service, this alone likely won\u0026rsquo;t get you 3 Mbps for the price of 1.5 Mbps.\nInstead of simply doubling down on T1 lines, consider switching to Ethernet over Copper. Both are dependable business-grade internet services with dedicated bandwidth. They can also be managed services, where the provider handles all the necessary equipment at your location to connect to their lines and your network. Another similarity between bonded T1 lines and Ethernet over Copper is that they both utilize the existing copper telephone wires already installed in your building. Although the signal types differ between T1 and Ethernet lines, they function the same way from a user\u0026rsquo;s perspective. The key difference lies in the cost. Ethernet over Copper, being a newer technology, utilizes the bandwidth capacity of copper lines more effectively. As a result, its pricing is very competitive, currently about half the cost of two bonded T1 lines. This means you could obtain a 3 Mbps Ethernet over Copper service for the same price as a 1.5 Mbps T1 service. A few other distinctions exist as well. T1 lines can only be upgraded in increments of 1.5 Mbps per bonded line. Ethernet, on the other hand, offers more flexibility, with bandwidth options ranging from 1 Mbps up to 10 Gbps, though higher speeds necessitate fiber optic cables. However, unlike T1, Ethernet over Copper has limited availability, primarily found in larger cities and suburbs rather than rural areas.\nInterested in doubling your internet speed without increasing your costs? Check pricing and availability for 3 x 3 Mbps Ethernet over Copper or other Ethernet bandwidth services to discover potential savings in your area.\n","date":"2024-06-24T02:52:02Z","permalink":"https://Nexus-Security.github.io/3x3-mbps-ethernet-doubles-your-bandwidth/","title":"3x3 Mbps Ethernet Doubles Your Bandwidth"},{"content":"For the past decade, small and medium businesses have relied on T1 lines as their primary commercial telecom solution. However, a new competitor called 2x2 Ethernet, recently introduced by major nationwide carrier MegaPath, is emerging to challenge the long-standing T1. Let\u0026rsquo;s explore what 2x2 Ethernet offers.\nIt might seem surprising that T1 lines would face competition, considering their 50-year history and widespread adoption. As the first widely available broadband digital connection for businesses, T1 emerged from telephone company research. Initially used to connect calls between switching centers, it later became commercially available. Leveraging repeater technology and unshielded twisted pair telco wires, T1 became the leading technology for digital phone lines, point-to-point connections, and dedicated broadband access.\nEthernet, on the other hand, originated in the computer industry and has become the dominant networking technology for local area networks (LANs). While traditionally considered a LAN technology, unlike the WAN-focused T1, Ethernet has steadily expanded into metropolitan and wide area networks in recent years. Now, it\u0026rsquo;s poised to replace T1 lines altogether. But why?\nBandwidth is a key factor. T1 lines offer a fixed, symmetrical bandwidth of 1.5 Mbps for both uploads and downloads. Ethernet, however, supports various speeds over copper and fiber optic cables. MegaPath\u0026rsquo;s 2x2 Ethernet provides 2 Mbps for both uploads and downloads, a modest but notable improvement over T1. Beyond the 33% capacity increase, 2x2 Ethernet offers simple integration. Connecting from WAN to LAN is as easy as using a standard Ethernet connector, eliminating the need for additional CSU/DSU interface circuitry required by T1 lines.\nThe most compelling aspect of MegaPath\u0026rsquo;s 2x2 Ethernet is its affordability compared to T1 lines. While Ethernet has often boasted lower per-Mbps costs than traditional telecom services, particularly at higher bandwidths, this 2 Mbps service undercuts the price of a 1.5 Mbps service. Additionally, customers can choose between data-only or voice and data configurations. Opting for at least five lines of digital, analog, or SIP trunking telephone service further reduces the cost of a 2x2 Ethernet line. These factors suggest that the era of T1 dominance might be coming to an end.\nMegaPath has addressed availability concerns by offering Ethernet over Copper connections through 1,900 central offices across the country, covering an estimated 90% of businesses, both small and large. MegaPath itself is a \u0026ldquo;super CLEC\u0026rdquo; (Competitive Local Exchange Carrier), formed by merging MegaPath, Covad, and Speakeasy, all significant carriers in their own right.\nIf your business needs new connectivity or you\u0026rsquo;re simply seeking a better deal on your current T1 line service, it\u0026rsquo;s worth exploring your options. Older T1 contracts could be costing you double what they should. Consider a quick pricing and availability inquiry for Ethernet over Copper services to be sure. Higher bandwidth options are also available for more demanding applications.\n","date":"2024-05-24T13:36:54Z","permalink":"https://Nexus-Security.github.io/2x2-ethernet-takes-on-t-1/","title":"2x2 Ethernet Takes on T-1"},{"content":"Wireless broadband is becoming increasingly popular and poised to replace many traditional wireline technologies thanks to its portability and mobility. However, the limited availability and speed of wireless connections have hindered its wider adoption and application. The emergence of 4G wireless technology offers a promising solution.\n](http://www.cellphoneplansfinder.com/)\nWhile 4G wireless lacks a precise definition, it generally refers to bandwidth comparable to cable broadband or Ethernet over copper business connections. With its high speed and broad coverage, 4G has the potential to serve both desktop and mobile devices.\nSome might consider WiFi a 4G technology due to its bandwidth capabilities. However, WiFi\u0026rsquo;s short-range nature limits its use to specific locations like homes, offices, or public spaces. Unlike cellular networks, WiFi connections are not designed for continuous use while on the move and function more like a personal area network.\nCellular phone service relies on higher-powered wireless technologies like 2G and 3G. These systems utilize networks of fixed transmitters and receivers arranged in cells to provide coverage across a wide area. The key to enabling seamless connectivity as users move between cells lies in effectively coordinating the handoff of the wireless connection.\nCurrently, 3G is the most prevalent wireless technology, providing bandwidth comparable to T1 lines and basic DSL, averaging around 1.5 Mbps in urban areas. While this speed is sufficient for many mobile activities like web browsing, email, and watching short videos, 3G faces limitations in both speed and bandwidth availability.\nSharing channels with cellular voice traffic on existing towers puts a strain on 3G networks, which were initially designed for voice calls. This shared bandwidth, coupled with the higher data demands of internet traffic, leads to carriers imposing data caps.\nThere are two main approaches to 4G wireless. Cell phone companies view it as an upgrade to their existing 3G infrastructure. The two dominant cellular systems, CDMA (used by Verizon and Sprint) and GSM (used by AT\u0026amp;T and T-Mobile), have adopted different paths to 4G.\nAT\u0026amp;T and T-Mobile have enhanced their 3G networks to HSPA+, offering speeds up to 6-8 Mbps. Verizon has implemented LTE, a 4G technology providing download speeds of 5-12 Mbps. Meanwhile, Sprint utilizes WiMAX, another 4G technology, delivering speeds between 3-6 Mbps.\nLooking ahead, 4G is expected to converge around two technologies: LTE and WiMAX. Considered a potential universal standard, LTE is widely discussed. WiMAX, predating LTE, is already deployed globally. Both technologies offer upgrade paths capable of boosting download speeds to over 100 Mbps and even 1000 Mbps, rivaling fiber optic speeds. This ensures the longevity of 4G wireless technology.\nFurthermore, 4G is increasingly utilizing lower frequency bands that can penetrate buildings more effectively. These bands, repurposed from UHF TV channels through a federal auction, offer greater flexibility. For instance, Clear provides 4G fixed and mobile wireless service, including a telephone option, using WiMAX in over 80 cities across the nation, currently offering unlimited broadband plans.\n](http://www.twitter.com/Telexplainer)\n","date":"2024-05-13T16:03:50Z","permalink":"https://Nexus-Security.github.io/4g-wireless-broadband-options/","title":"4G Wireless Broadband Options"},{"content":" Intelligent noise reduction\nIncludes an airplane adapter and a USB Type-C to 3.5 mm connector\nA quick 10-minute charge provides 3 hours of playback\nBluetooth 4.2 connectivity with Hi-Res Transmission Technology\nMaking their debut at the PC Show 2019 in Singapore are 1MORE\u0026rsquo;s inaugural noise-canceling headphones, known as the Dual Driver Bluetooth (BT) Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) In-Ear Headphones.\nThe headphones have garnered significant attention due to the involvement of renowned Chinese celebrity Jay Chou, who has invested in the company, and the expertise of Grammy-winning sound engineer Luca Bignardi, responsible for fine-tuning their audio.\nThese lightweight and wireless headphones excel in noise cancellation, allowing audiophiles to immerse themselves in their favorite music and enjoy clear voice calls even in bustling settings.\nThe 1MORE Dual Driver BT ANC In-Ear headphones utilize their proprietary TiinLab A2 Chip, a low-power technology, to analyze and counteract external noise by generating opposing sound waves.

Major carriers like AT\u0026amp;T, Verizon, and Sprint have upgraded most of their towers in populated areas, and 3G devices are readily available. However, the focus is shifting to 4G due to the increasing demand for bandwidth from sophisticated mobile applications and the ongoing competition among carriers.\nThe value of 4G lies in its potential to enable future advancements rather than just meeting current needs. Similar to the space race or the transcontinental railroad, the development of 4G is driven by a forward-thinking approach.\nThe 3G competition revolves around two incompatible standards: EVDO for CDMA networks (Verizon, Alltel, Sprint) and UMTS broadband (AT\u0026amp;T, T-Mobile, and international carriers) for GSM networks.\nSimilarly, the 4G competition is also split between two standards: WiMAX, a global standard for fixed and mobile broadband, and LTE, which has garnered support from both Verizon and AT\u0026amp;T. While Sprint and fixed wireless provider Clearwire are backing WiMAX, Verizon and AT\u0026amp;T are adopting LTE.\nUnlike the transition from analog to digital TV, 3G and 4G will coexist for a significant period. This coexistence is possible because WiMAX operates on the 2.5 GHz band using Sprint and Clearwire\u0026rsquo;s combined channel licenses, while Verizon and AT\u0026amp;T will utilize the 700 MHz spectrum previously used for analog TV broadcasting.\nThe actual bandwidth provided by 4G remains a question. Although initial claims for WiMAX touted a range of 30 miles and speeds of 30-70 Mbps, real-world performance has been lower. Sprint\u0026rsquo;s Xohm service in Baltimore offered 2-4 Mbps, and Clearwire\u0026rsquo;s Clear 4G service in Portland, OR, provides 4-6 Mbps.\nWhile LTE is not yet deployed, tests have shown peak data rates of 60-80 Mbps. Verizon estimates average LTE speeds around 8 Mbps, but this could be a conservative figure. Both LTE and WiMAX have the potential to scale up and offer faster speeds as demand and competition increase.\nCurrently, WiMAX has a head start in the 4G race with systems already commercially available. However, Verizon\u0026rsquo;s LTE operates on lower frequencies, potentially enabling better building penetration. Verizon plans to have LTE in two markets by the end of the year and expand to 25-30 markets in 2010, a pace similar to WiMAX\u0026rsquo;s projected rollout.\nBy 2011 or 2012, 4G is expected to reach a tipping point, offering both mobile and fixed location services. This will create competition for DSL and cable internet providers while also empowering smartphones and netbooks. Video streaming, cloud computing, and interactive applications are anticipated to be the driving forces behind 4G adoption, taking advantage of the increased bandwidth.\n","date":"2024-03-17T14:17:55Z","permalink":"https://Nexus-Security.github.io/4g-wireless-broadband-wars-this-year/","title":"4G Wireless Broadband Wars This Year"},{"content":"Reliable and fast business internet access is crucial for customer interaction and order processing. While you aim for a stable connection with sufficient bandwidth, you also need a budget-friendly option. Let\u0026rsquo;s explore ways to incrementally boost your internet speed in line with your business requirements.\n](http://www.T1Rex.com/)\nDedicated internet access used to be limited to a 1.5 Mbps T1 line or a 45 Mbps T3 line (DS3 bandwidth). Shared bandwidth services offer more choices, but their performance and availability can fluctuate. Additionally, they often have asymmetrical speeds, with download speeds significantly higher than upload speeds.\nDedicated options like T1 and T3 offer symmetrical bandwidth, consistent speed, and high availability backed by a Service Level Agreement (SLA). However, cost remains a concern, particularly if your needs exceed a T1 line but not a full T3 line.\nWhile fractional line services offer a portion of a full line\u0026rsquo;s capacity at a reduced cost, they aren\u0026rsquo;t the most cost-effective per Mbps.\nA better solution is bonded line service. Bonding combines multiple lines of the same type to increase bandwidth. For example, bonding two T1 lines provides 3 Mbps instead of 1.5 Mbps. Your router sees this as a single, larger bandwidth service, simplifying management.\nWhile bonding offers incremental bandwidth increases, remember that bonded lines must be obtained from the same carrier. Additionally, costs increase proportionally with bandwidth; two T1 lines cost double a single line. This might be acceptable for doubling your speed compared to a tenfold price jump for a T3 line, but it becomes less appealing as you bond more lines.\nYou can bond up to eight T1 lines for 11 Mbps, but the cost might then near that of a 45 Mbps T3 line.\nEthernet over Copper (EoC) is another bonded service potentially offering more bandwidth for less. EoC uses multiple wire pairs, bonding 2, 4, 6, or 8 pairs for speed increases. Unlike T1, EoC offers a broader range of bandwidth choices. A 2-3 Mbps EoC connection might cost the same as a T1 line, with other options ranging from 5 Mbps to 45 Mbps. EoC\u0026rsquo;s cost per Mbps decreases with higher bandwidth levels.\nHowever, EoC availability is limited due to its reliance on newer technology not present in all central offices. Distance also affects EoC speeds; proximity to your central office is crucial for optimal performance. Still, it may offer better speeds than bonded T1 at a lower cost.\nIf a reliable internet connection is essential for your business, explore the availability and pricing of bonded T1 and EoC dedicated internet access options.\n","date":"2023-12-05T19:54:55Z","permalink":"https://Nexus-Security.github.io/3-mbps-to-6-mbps-bonded-internet-access/","title":"3 Mbps to 6 Mbps Bonded Internet Access"},{"content":"Cellular companies are promoting 3G wireless technology as the most advanced available.

To help you decide, let\u0026rsquo;s explore the three primary cloud types and which applications are well-suited for cloud environments.\nThese days, it seems everyone is offering cloud services, primarily based on three architectures: public, private, and hybrid clouds.\nThe most common is the public cloud, a specialized data center owned and operated by a provider serving numerous paying customers concurrently. This type of data center, often highly secure and equipped with robust backup systems, is desirable but expensive to maintain.\nRedundancy is crucial for cloud success, ensuring reliability through features like Service Level Agreements (SLAs) that guarantee uptime, restoration speed, and compensation for outages. These SLAs differentiate enterprise-grade providers from consumer-oriented services.\nRedundancy encompasses duplicating critical components like servers, power sources, network infrastructure, and even staffing to ensure continuous operation.\nVirtualization, another key aspect, optimizes resource use. Since many applications don\u0026rsquo;t fully utilize server capacity, virtualization allows multiple servers to operate as one, distributing workload dynamically.\nThis principle underpins the private cloud, where you build your own virtualized data center. You own, maintain, and control all resources, ideal for high-security or heavily regulated environments.\nHowever, public clouds often offer better cost-effectiveness due to economies of scale. A newer option is a private cloud within a public data center, providing isolation without the investment and upkeep.\nLastly, the hybrid cloud combines public and private elements. You might use a public cloud for general applications and a private one for sensitive data, controlling information sharing between them.\nStill unsure about cloud services?

The good news is this bandwidth level is now attainable at a reasonable cost.\nWhere Can I Get 10 Gbps Dedicated Internet? 10 Gigabit Ethernet service is now commonly available in most cities due to the widespread adoption of fiber optic infrastructure. Fiber optic lines are necessary to deliver the increased bandwidth required to support 4G LTE and 5G cell towers, replacing the older, slower T1 copper lines. Cable companies also utilize fiber lines for their core infrastructure, although the final connection to a cable modem still uses coaxial copper cable. Many cities are now installing fiber infrastructure as a public utility to bring service to all homes and businesses.\nOnce fiber optic cables are in place, establishing Gigabit and 10 Gigabit broadband connections is simple. Each fiber strand can handle 10 Gbps of bandwidth on just one channel. These same strands can also be configured to use multiple wavelengths of light to carry numerous Gigabit and 10 Gigabit services. A single fiber optic cable can hold anywhere from a few to over a hundred fiber strands. You can be confident that there is an abundance of 10 Gbps capacity readily available.\nWhat 10 Gbps Service Options Are Available? The most popular service in demand is Dedicated Internet Access (DIA). Dedicated means you have exclusive use of your internet connection. All unused capacity on your connection is idle and at your disposal. You do not share bandwidth with other users.\nDedicated Internet Access provides the most consistent connection with the lowest latency (delay) for accessing the core of the internet. This is important if your company relies on remote servers in the cloud or uses colocation hosting. This type of connection is also important if you conduct business over the Internet and need your customers to have a smooth, responsive online experience.\nThere are also private, point-to-point 10 Gbps connections that can link your business locations or connect your company to a cloud service provider. This type of connection is a step above accessing services over the public internet. Private lines provide the lowest latency and the least amount of congestion. Having a dedicated private line makes your servers feel like they\u0026rsquo;re right down the hall, even if they\u0026rsquo;re geographically located across the country.\nCable internet providers now offer a shared bandwidth service that can achieve 10 Gbps download speeds using the DOCSIS 3.1 standard and will soon offer symmetrical 10 Gbps upload and download speeds using the DOCSIS 4.0 standard. While sharing an internet connection with other users can save money, connection speeds can fluctuate depending on network congestion and the number of active users.\nWhat about wireless internet options? In some metropolitan areas, fixed wireless internet service delivered over microwave frequencies can provide bandwidth as high as 10 Gbps without the need for a wired connection. Installation times for fixed wireless are typically fast, sometimes only taking a few days or a week.\nHow Much Does 10 Gbps Internet Cost? Fiber optic service used to be very expensive, but prices have dropped in recent years due to increased competition among service providers and the economies of scale that come with more users subscribing to higher bandwidth services. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t priced out 10 Gbps internet service recently, you should get quotes from several providers. You may be surprised to find that several providers can now meet your needs.\n","date":"2023-08-07T04:37:18Z","permalink":"https://Nexus-Security.github.io/10-gbps-dedicated-internet-access-availability/","title":"10 Gbps Dedicated Internet Access Availability"},{"content":"By Steve Endow\nThis article presents several helpful tips for using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) more efficiently.\nA video demonstrating these tips is available.\nUtilize the Object Explorer Details Window: Many users are unaware of the time-saving benefits offered by the Object Explorer Details window. Instead of solely relying on the Object Explorer pane for finding tables or stored procedures, pressing F7 to open the Details window significantly speeds up navigation and search. The video provides a demonstration of this feature. Double-Click Error Messages for Quick Navigation: When troubleshooting complex queries, double-clicking on an error message in SSMS will automatically direct you to the specific line of code causing the issue. Enable Line Numbers for Easy Reference: Displaying line numbers within the query window makes it simpler to pinpoint specific lines, especially when dealing with error messages or collaborative debugging. Effortlessly Transfer Query Results with Headers: When copying query results to Excel, using the \u0026ldquo;Copy with Headers\u0026rdquo; feature (right-click the blank square above row 1 or use CTRL+SHIFT+C) simplifies data transfer by automatically including column headers. Directly Save Query Results as Text Files: While less frequent, the option to save query results directly to a text file can be useful. SSMS provides comma or tab-delimited formatting for text output. However, it\u0026rsquo;s essential to note that the comma-delimited option might not create a fully CSV-compliant file, as it doesn\u0026rsquo;t automatically enclose text values containing commas within apostrophes. Improve SSMS Display Scaling on High-Resolution Screens: On high DPI displays, like 4K monitors or high-resolution laptops, SSMS might appear poorly scaled. This issue can be resolved by implementing the fixes detailed in a SQL Server Central post, as demonstrated in the video. The post provides a solution for adjusting the scaling to display appropriate icon sizes and readable text. Before the fix, icons may appear small, and text might seem squeezed.\nAfter applying the fix, the scaling is improved, resulting in a better visual experience.\nHopefully, these tips offer valuable insights for enhancing productivity when working with SQL Server Management Studio.\nSteve Endow is a Microsoft MVP for Dynamics GP and a Dynamics GP Certified IT Professional in Los Angeles.

It\u0026rsquo;s becoming commonplace to see requests for 1,000 Mbps connections, often fulfilled by a 1 Gbps Ethernet or GigE point-to-point connection. Let\u0026rsquo;s explore the details and available choices for Gigabit Ethernet service.\nEthernet, the standard protocol for LANs, commonly operates at speeds of 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, 1,000 Mbps, or 10 Gbps. Many network devices support multiple speeds, typically 10/100/1000 Mbps. It\u0026rsquo;s a natural progression to want to extend the LAN\u0026rsquo;s reach through the WAN to connect with another LAN. The key to avoiding bottlenecks that cause network congestion, while simultaneously preventing overspending on excessive WAN bandwidth, is to align your LAN and WAN speeds. This means using consistent LAN speeds and protocols.\nFortunately, the Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF), an industry group responsible for establishing vendor interoperability standards, has addressed this need. They\u0026rsquo;ve developed the necessary standards to enable the transportation of LAN Ethernet over WAN connections, known as Carrier Ethernet within the WAN environment.\nThis process begins and ends with a User Network Interface (UNI), a \u0026ldquo;port\u0026rdquo; installed at the user\u0026rsquo;s location(s) by the carrier or service provider. UNIs are designed to operate at standard LAN speeds: 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps, or 10 Gbps. However, this doesn\u0026rsquo;t restrict you to just these service speeds. The installed UNI determines the maximum bandwidth it can handle. The actual service speed is controlled by the carrier, limiting it to match your purchased bandwidth, which could be 20 Mbps, 75 Mbps, 450 Mbps, or another increment. This flexibility ensures you only pay for the bandwidth you actually require.\nThis setup offers a significant benefit. Not only are you not bound by a service that\u0026rsquo;s either insufficient or excessive for your needs, but the hardware is equipped to support the UNI\u0026rsquo;s port speed. The service provider can easily adjust the rate limiting via software, allowing for quick bandwidth increases. This means you can request a bandwidth upgrade and have it implemented potentially within hours or days. The carrier simply implements the change and modifies your billing accordingly. This streamlined approach contrasts sharply with traditional telecom services, which often necessitate on-site visits to install new equipment or wiring. As long as your UNI supports 1 Gbps, no hardware upgrades are needed until you exceed that speed.\nThe actual data transfer occurs over an Ethernet Virtual Connection (EVC), providing a point-to-point link between specific UNIs and preventing data exchange between sites that aren\u0026rsquo;t part of the same EVC. This widely used Ethernet point-to-point service is known as EPL or Ethernet Private Line, serving as a direct replacement for TDM private lines.\nAn interesting characteristic of Ethernet UNIs is their ability to manage multiple EVCs. This might seem unusual compared to typical telecom UNIs that connect physical wires and carry a single Point-to-Point (PTP) line service. You can think of each EVC as a separate private line. This delivery of multiple EVCs over a single UNI is referred to as EVPL or Ethernet Virtual Private Line service. A common topology is a hub-and-spoke configuration, where a central headquarters connects to various branch offices using EVPL. In this setup, only a single physical UNI is required at the headquarters to support all the private line spoke connections.\nIs your business ready to embrace higher bandwidth WAN service? Explore the affordability of supporting 1 Gbps Point to Point Ethernet Connections using EPL and EVPL.\n","date":"2023-04-04T08:16:09Z","permalink":"https://Nexus-Security.github.io/1-gbps-point-to-point-ethernet-connection/","title":"1 Gbps Point to Point Ethernet Connection"},{"content":"If your home or business needs affordable broadband internet, there\u0026rsquo;s good news: a solution might be closer than you think.\nCLEAR, a company pioneering 4G Wireless broadband using the WiMAX standard, is expanding its reach to more cities.

But sometimes even 1 Gbps isn\u0026rsquo;t enough, and that\u0026rsquo;s when you need to consider upgrading to 10 Gigabit Internet.\nWho Needs 10 Gbps Bandwidth? Most small businesses and almost all residential internet users don\u0026rsquo;t need this much speed. The bragging rights aren\u0026rsquo;t worth the high monthly fees. This level of bandwidth is meant for demanding applications that justify the cost.\nJust a short while ago, 10 Gbps connections were only found in the core networks of telecommunication companies and the internet itself. But times have changed, and what was sufficient a decade ago is now barely adequate. Those 10 Gbps lines have become more widely available and easier for businesses to obtain.\nCloud services, colocation centers, and large corporations with thousands of connected employees need gigabit and 10 gigabit speeds, or even faster. High-tech companies and those using advanced tools might also require these higher speeds. Content providers absolutely need it. And hospitals and medical centers dealing with large imaging files can\u0026rsquo;t afford to wait for slow transfers.\nWhat’s Involved In Acquiring 10 Gigabit Service? These high speeds are almost always delivered through fiber optic cable. Once fiber is installed, getting high speeds is just as easy as getting slower speeds. This is because fiber optic cable has a very high capacity for data transmission. The limiting factors are the number of fibers in the cable and the equipment at each end.\nThe first standard for high-speed fiber transmission was called SONET (Synchronous Optical Network) and was developed by telephone companies. You might have heard of OC-192, which is the 10 Gbps SONET Optical Carrier level. These days, most competitive networks, and even the telephone companies, are switching to Carrier Ethernet. Ethernet is directly compatible with almost all local area networks. It can also easily scale from 10 Mbps to 10 Gbps and beyond. What\u0026rsquo;s even more important for most businesses is that Carrier Ethernet (also called Ethernet over Fiber) is typically more readily available and less expensive than the older SONET technology.\nMany regional, national, and international carriers now offer 10 Gig Ethernet access and point-to-point private lines. This means you might have several competitive offers to compare.\nWhy 10 Gbps Dedicated Internet Access? Imagine the internet as a vast electronic highway system with major interstates and countless on-ramps. Unless you\u0026rsquo;re a part of the internet\u0026rsquo;s core infrastructure, you\u0026rsquo;ll be connecting through one of these on-ramps, and their performance varies greatly.\nThe best internet performance comes from connecting to the network backbone through a high-tier provider using a dedicated connection. \u0026ldquo;Dedicated\u0026rdquo; means that you are the sole user of the bandwidth you\u0026rsquo;ve leased. This might seem like the standard, but most internet connections designed for consumers and smaller businesses are shared, not dedicated. By combining multiple customers on a single line, cable, satellite, and cellular wireless companies can offer affordable internet connections at reasonable speeds.\nAnother important factor is symmetric bandwidth. This means you have 10 Gbps for both uploading and downloading data. Those budget-friendly internet options usually have asymmetric bandwidth, with faster download speeds and slower upload speeds.\nBandwidth to Grow With Your Needs Since Carrier Ethernet is easily scalable, you can order the bandwidth you need now and upgrade it later as your business grows. With a 10 Gbps port, you can start with 1 Gbps, 5 Gbps, or another speed, paying only for what you use. As long as you have enough port speed, you can often upgrade with a simple phone call to your provider or even through your online account.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re struggling with limited bandwidth but are worried that the solution is unavailable or too expensive, you might be pleasantly surprised. Go ahead and request competitive quotes from Dedicated Internet Access providers in your area.\n","date":"2022-12-28T09:56:47Z","permalink":"https://Nexus-Security.github.io/10-gbps-dedicated-internet-access-has-the-speed-you-need/","title":"10 Gbps Dedicated Internet Access Has the Speed You Need"},{"content":"Mobile internet usage has increased, but bandwidth limitations are comparable to the early days of dial-up compared to today\u0026rsquo;s broadband. Let\u0026rsquo;s examine current mobile internet speeds.\nThe current standard, 3G wireless, provides speeds between 500 Kbps and 1.5 Mbps through cellular carriers. These carriers are the same ones providing cell phone service, using the same towers, so coverage is identical.\nThe demand for 3G increased dramatically after the iPhone\u0026rsquo;s release. The first iPhone utilized AT\u0026amp;T\u0026rsquo;s EDGE network, a 2.5G network significantly slower than the newer HSPA (High Speed Packet Access) 3G network offered by AT\u0026amp;T and T-Mobile.\nVerizon and Sprint, on the other hand, utilize CDMA technology for their 3G services, known as EV-DO and EV-DO Rev A, with download speeds ranging from 1 to 2 Mbps.\nBoth 2.5G and 3G cellular broadband enable video streaming and internet browsing on mobile devices and laptops using plug-in wireless modem aircards. These aircards, sold with data-only plans, have become essential for mobile professionals.\nThe latest advancement, 4G mobile bandwidth, is currently led by Clearwire and Sprint\u0026rsquo;s WiMAX service, marketed under the CLEAR brand. Unlike cellular networks, WiMAX operates as a city-wide network, transmitting strong signals capable of penetrating buildings, making it suitable for both desktops and laptops. Download speeds typically range from 3 to 6 Mbps, surpassing 3G speeds.\nHowever, cellular companies are developing their own 4G solution. AT\u0026amp;T and Verizon are preparing to launch LTE, a competitor to WiMAX. While widespread availability of both technologies is still a year or two away, WiMAX currently offers the fastest mobile bandwidth at the most affordable price in areas where it is available.\n","date":"2022-12-25T18:55:32Z","permalink":"https://Nexus-Security.github.io/3g-4g-mobile-bandwidth/","title":"3G 4G Mobile Bandwidth"},{"content":"Are you unhappy with your current internet options at home and on the go?

Let\u0026rsquo;s explore what MPLS networks offer and the various ways to access them.\nImagine an MPLS network as a dedicated internet exclusively for businesses. Privately owned and operated, MPLS networks don\u0026rsquo;t provide services or connections for residential users, making them strictly business-to-business (B2B). Numerous service providers operate their own MPLS networks, offering regional, national, or international coverage. Some providers even specialize in connecting different MPLS networks, creating expansive \u0026ldquo;MPLS Mesh\u0026rdquo; networks.\nMPLS often forms the core network for major service providers due to its adaptability. The underlying infrastructure typically consists of IP-based or SONET/SDH fiber optic service at speeds of 10 Gbps or higher, with many networks transitioning from 40 Gbps to the cutting-edge 100 Gbps. The defining feature of an MPLS network lies in its unique switching and routing system, which operates independently of specific protocols.\nMPLS stands for Multi-Protocol Label Switching. \u0026ldquo;Multi-Protocol\u0026rdquo; signifies its ability to handle various data types, including Voice, Data, Video IP, SONET, T-Carrier, and more, simultaneously and without conflicts. \u0026ldquo;Label Switching\u0026rdquo; refers to the method of tagging each data packet entering the network. This tag guides the packet to its destination using an appropriate class of service and is removed upon exit, ensuring data integrity.\nThink of MPLS networks as private high-speed highways, with access points acting as on and off-ramps. One significant advantage of using MPLS for long-distance data transmission is the simplicity it offers: businesses only need to focus on getting their data to and from the network. The network operator takes care of optimizing performance within the MPLS network, ensuring sufficient bandwidth with minimal latency, jitter, and packet loss.\nEarthLink Business, for example, provides a nationwide, access-agnostic MPLS network with Service Level Agreements (SLAs) determined by Class of Service (CoS). They offer five distinct access technologies tailored to the needs of each business location, which can be mixed and matched while maintaining consistent CoS across a business\u0026rsquo;s network. Here\u0026rsquo;s a breakdown:\nT1 Lines: The traditional and still prevalent access method, T1 lines are widely available over existing copper telephone wiring in most business locations. They offer symmetrical bandwidth of 1.5 Mbps, which can be increased by combining multiple lines. EarthLink boasts a four-hour mean time to repair (MTTR) for private T1 lines in case of disruptions.\nDSL: Considered a budget-friendly alternative to T1, ADSL provides asymmetrical bandwidth with faster download than upload speeds. EarthLink is a pioneer in offering CoS traffic management over DSL, making it a viable option for business applications.\nEthernet over Copper (EoC) and Fiber (EoF): EoC and EoF are strong contenders against T1, DS3, and high-speed SONET fiber services. Ethernet aligns better with IP traffic compared to circuit-switched TDM (Time Division Multiplexing) technologies. Additionally, it offers scalability and cost-effectiveness per Mbps where available.\nWireless Access: Ideal for newly established locations needing quick setup or for affordable access where DSL is limited, wireless access provides flexibility. 3G and 4G cellular bandwidth, often available in remote areas, can offer speeds equal to or greater than T1 without requiring a landline. Fixed wireless microwave transmission provides even higher speeds and can serve as a practical alternative to fiber.\nMPLS IPsec: EarthLink also offers this unique service. You might know IPsec, or IP Security, as a VPN technology used for secure internet connections. Its security stems from the 3DES encryption algorithm (168-bit), which is the financial industry standard for network-layer encryption. IPsec enables businesses to use local internet providers in remote areas while securely connecting to the corporate MPLS network.\nCould MPLS be the right solution for your business networking needs? What access methods are suitable for your different locations? A complimentary set of MPLS network and access service quotes can help you compare options and potentially reveal cost savings compared to your current WAN solution.\n","date":"2022-08-16T16:26:36Z","permalink":"https://Nexus-Security.github.io/5-ways-to-access-an-mpls-network/","title":"5 Ways to Access An MPLS Network"},{"content":"The demand for internet access is constantly increasing due to factors like video content, big data, large websites, cloud services, and technological advancements. Internet speeds have evolved significantly, from less than 1 Kbps to 1 Gbps, and reaching 10 Gbps is only a matter of time. This article explores cost-effective ways for businesses to achieve Gbps bandwidth without breaking the bank.\nPreviously, obtaining hundreds or thousands of Mbps required SONET/SDH fiber optic service, with limited options like OC-12 (622 Mbps), OC-24 (1.2 Gbps), and OC-48 (2.5 Gbps). OC-24 availability was inconsistent, often leaving OC-48 as the only choice for Gigabit speeds.\nCarrier Ethernet offers a newer alternative. Mirroring standard LAN speeds, it provides 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps, and 10 Gbps, along with finer increments like 1 Mbps steps below 10 Gbps, 10 Mbps steps up to 100 Mbps, and 100 Mbps steps up to 1 Gbps. Speeds like 250 Mbps and 750 Mbps are also possible, depending on the provider\u0026rsquo;s offerings.\nCarrier Ethernet boasts faster scalability compared to traditional telecom services. Bandwidth upgrades often require just a phone call, with changes implemented within hours or days. The future holds the promise of instant provisioning or self-service through web portals.\nCarrier Ethernet\u0026rsquo;s advantage lies in its emulation of LAN technology, designed for long-distance use. LAN network cards typically support various bandwidths (e.g., 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, 1000 Mbps), enabling connections up to the cabling and switch limitations. In Carrier Ethernet, the port speed determines the maximum bandwidth. For instance, a 100 Mbps Fast Ethernet port allows speeds up to 100 Mbps, while a 1,000 Mbps Gigabit Ethernet port supports up to 1 Gbps.\nGigabit Ethernet (1 Gbps) is gaining popularity, especially among medium and large businesses. For those anticipating the need for higher bandwidth in the near future, fractional Gigabit service presents an ideal solution. By installing a Gigabit Ethernet port but initially subscribing to a lower bandwidth (e.g., 250, 500, or 750 Mbps), businesses can easily upgrade their WAN speed as needed without paying for unused capacity.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re seeking a faster dedicated internet connection but are dissatisfied with existing service levels and prices, explore Gigabit Carrier Ethernet Internet Service. It might be the cost-effective solution you\u0026rsquo;ve been looking for, now and in the future.\n","date":"2022-08-04T02:12:38Z","permalink":"https://Nexus-Security.github.io/1-gbps-ethernet-service-to-the-internet/","title":"1 Gbps Ethernet Service To The Internet"},{"content":"Businesses often want greater internet bandwidth, lower telecommunication costs, or both. A relatively new service called 5x5 Ethernet might be the solution.\nEthernet services are a recent development. Before their rise in popularity, the best bandwidth options were T1 lines and fractional DS3 bandwidth. Fixed location wireless service has sometimes been available, but only for locations with a direct line of sight to their provider.\nHow do Ethernet services improve upon previous options? They frequently offer greater bandwidth at lower costs, even for low bandwidth services over copper.\nEthernet services are often categorized as Metro Ethernet, Carrier Ethernet, or by their bandwidth level. For example, 5x5 Mbps Ethernet denotes a dedicated speed of 5 Mbps for both uploads and downloads. This symmetrical bandwidth is standard for other telecom services but differs significantly from consumer-oriented services like DSL and Cable broadband.\nSymmetrical bandwidth is crucial for transferring files between locations or backing up data to the cloud or a remote data center. In contrast, asymmetrical services, which have slower upload speeds, are designed for web browsing. This is because downloading web pages involves more data than sending commands to the server. While this also applies to video streaming, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t hold for video conferencing. Generally, any two-way online activity benefits from symmetrical bandwidth.\nIf your business currently relies on a T1 line or a combination of T1 lines, also known as fractional DS3 bandwidth, EoC (Ethernet over Copper) might be a more cost-effective solution. You\u0026rsquo;ll experience the same high quality of service expected from T1 or other telecom services but at a reduced price.\nHow much can you save? Suppose your business requires 5 Mbps symmetrical bandwidth for file transfers, video conferencing, or dedicated internet access. You could approximate this by combining three T1 lines to achieve 4.5 Mbps or four T1 lines for 6 Mbps. However, T-carrier service requires upgrades in 1.5 Mbps increments.\nThe issue with T1 lines is the lack of economies of scale. Two lines cost double a single line, and three lines, necessary for 4.5 Mbps, triple the price. Additionally, increasing bandwidth requires installing new lines, and there\u0026rsquo;s no cost-saving benefit to having additional capacity.\nComparatively, Ethernet pricing is more competitive than T1. Often, 2 Mbps Ethernet costs the same or less than a T1 line, and sometimes even 3 Mbps is available at that price. Your 5x5 Mbps Ethernet will likely cost roughly twice as much as a T1 line but deliver over three times the bandwidth. You might even find a better deal. The ambiguity in these figures arises from the fact that both T1 and Ethernet pricing depends heavily on the available services and competition at your business location.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also important to note that Ethernet over Copper utilizes the same twisted-pair telephone wiring as T1 service. The technology leverages multiple pairs to increase bandwidth and is significantly more scalable than T-carrier services.\nTo optimize your setup, install an Ethernet port capable of handling your anticipated bandwidth needs in the foreseeable future. Then, order the bandwidth you require immediately. You should be able to upgrade your bandwidth quickly and effortlessly whenever needed by simply contacting your provider, without installation or construction delays.\nReady for concrete numbers comparing Ethernet to T1 and DS3 services?

This number becomes your primary business contact, allowing clients to reach you anytime, even sending faxes.\nMaintaining your toll-free number is also budget-friendly, with a low monthly fee and a per-minute charge only for calls from within the contiguous United States. Since these calls are from clients and potential customers, they are inherently valuable.\nFor a nominal monthly fee plus call charges, Kall8 provides a comprehensive mobile office communication setup. You can manage where your toll-free number rings through an online control panel, forwarding calls to your landline, cell phone, or any internet-connected computer as needed.\nIf you can\u0026rsquo;t answer a call, the voicemail feature is particularly useful. Incoming calls are recorded, converted to audio files, and forwarded to your email upon request. The same applies to faxes; senders can use your toll-free number, and faxes will be converted to email attachments accessible at your convenience. While often expensive add-ons elsewhere, Kall8 includes voicemail-to-email and fax-to-email with its toll-free service.\nProfessionals across various fields, such as engineering, technology, recruitment, crafts, arts, real estate, and sales, have found that an affordable toll-free service is invaluable for effective client communication.\n","date":"2022-06-06T12:25:25Z","permalink":"https://Nexus-Security.github.io/2-toll-free-numbers-help-professionals-go-independent/","title":"$2 Toll Free Numbers Help Professionals Go Independent"},{"content":"By: John Shepler\nFor about 150 years, twisted pair copper wiring has been the standard way to deliver telecom services. This includes everything from traditional phone service to T1 lines for internet access and private connections. However, copper wiring is becoming outdated. Even if you haven\u0026rsquo;t reached the bandwidth limits of copper yet, you might face issues if your local telephone company (which owns the copper lines) decides to stop service. So, what are the alternatives?\nAlternatives to Copper Lines\nFiber optic cables are unmatched in terms of bandwidth. You can get speeds ranging from 10 Mbps to 10 Gbps, and even 100 Gbps in some areas. Hybrid Fiber Cable, also called cable broadband, can now deliver multi-gigabit speeds using the traditional coaxial cable.\nThis sounds promising, but what if you\u0026rsquo;re in an area without cable service and no fiber optic infrastructure nearby? Are you left without any service options?\n5G Wireless: A Solution\nFifth-generation (5G) smartphones have mostly replaced the 4G LTE standard. 5G introduces new bands with increased bandwidth and lower latency, suitable for smart devices that make up the Internet of Things.\nAnother area where 5G is making significant progress is fixed wireless access (FWA). \u0026ldquo;Fixed\u0026rdquo; in FWA implies stationary applications like desktop computers, point-of-sale systems, or even your entire Local Area Network.\nWireless Internet Service Providers (WISPs) have been providing internet service to homes and businesses without access to wired or fiber internet. They are typically local and independent, using systems separate from cellular providers. If you have a WISP nearby, they can often provide the internet access you need.\nWhat sets 5G apart from traditional WISPs is that it\u0026rsquo;s true cellular broadband, serving both stationary and mobile users. The same broadband you use on your phone can be delivered to an office, store, or home within range of a cell tower.\n4G LTE initially drove the shift towards using cellular broadband instead of DSL, cable, or other wired services. When 4G LTE became widely available, it offered speeds comparable to standard broadband services and had enough capacity to serve many users simultaneously.\nWhile 4G LTE remains a viable choice for various uses, 5G offers fiber-like speeds with low latency for applications requiring quick responses. Major cellular carriers are promoting 5G wireless as a competitor to cable internet in fixed locations. For businesses, 5G can often replace unavailable T1 lines or even DS3 bandwidth.\nHow to Get 5G FWA\nYou might have connected your phone to your computer or tablet via Bluetooth, using your phone as a personal internet hotspot. FWA takes this concept further. Instead of a phone, you install a 5G or 5G/4G LTE gateway, which could be a small device placed on your desk or a shelf. It may have an Ethernet port to connect to your router or might include a router and Wi-Fi hotspot. Some gateways have special antennas to enhance signal reception from the cell tower.\nTo explore 5G and 4G LTE options for your business, consider working with a bandwidth broker who represents multiple service providers. They can help you find a reliable connection with sufficient bandwidth for your business needs and suitable data limits. You might be surprised by the range of choices available, even in rural or underserved areas.\n","date":"2022-05-29T13:30:21Z","permalink":"https://Nexus-Security.github.io/5g-fixed-wireless-fills-the-copper-gap/","title":"5G Fixed Wireless Fills the Copper Gap"}]
