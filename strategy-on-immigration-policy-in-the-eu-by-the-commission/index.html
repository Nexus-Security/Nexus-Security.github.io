Please be aware that the content may change before publication and may be incomplete.</p><p><strong>I. Introduction</strong></p><p>Migration has been a constant throughout human history, driven by a range of factors such as political oppression, war, poverty, opportunity, and family reunification. Each migrant&rsquo;s story is unique, and their movement has diverse impacts on society, necessitating a variety of responses. This agenda outlines the steps the European Union should take, now and in the future, to effectively manage this challenge.</p><p>Protecting those in need is paramount. The distressing image of thousands of migrants risking their lives crossing the Mediterranean has deeply affected everyone. In response, the Commission presented a ten-point plan for immediate action, which received support from the European Parliament, the European Council, and commitments from Member States to prevent further tragedies.</p><p>This response, while necessary, was not enough. Emergency measures were needed due to the shortcomings of the collective European policy on migration. Although many Europeans responded with compassion, there are widespread concerns about the adequacy of current migration policies in handling the influx of migrants, integrating them into society, and addressing the economic needs of a demographically challenged Europe.</p><p>To combat the suffering inflicted by those who exploit migrants, the EU must leverage its global influence and resources to address the root causes of migration. Some causes are deep-seated, such as globalization and technological advancements that have created both opportunities and heightened expectations. Others stem from conflicts and crises, from Ukraine to the Middle East and North Africa. The effects of global poverty and conflict extend beyond national borders. Europe should remain a safe haven for those fleeing persecution, while acknowledging that it is also a desirable destination for economic migrants. Balancing these factors while safeguarding our borders, fostering economic prosperity, and ensuring societal well-being requires coordinated action at the European level.</p><p>This demands a set of core measures and a clear, consistent common policy. We must restore confidence in our ability to combine European and national efforts to manage migration, meet our international and ethical obligations, and work together effectively. A European solution is crucial because no single Member State can tackle these challenges alone. However, a new approach is clearly needed, one that utilizes all available policies and tools, integrating internal and external policies for maximum impact. This also requires demonstrating solidarity and shared responsibility. All actors, including Member States and EU institutions, must collaborate to make a common European migration policy a reality.</p><p>.</p><p><strong>II. Immediate action</strong></p><p>This European Agenda on Migration responds to the urgent need for action in light of the humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean. The European Council statement on April 23rd, 2015<a class=link href=file:///C:/Users/kiran/Documents/Commission%20migration%20paper.doc#_ftn1>[1]</a> and the subsequent European Parliament Resolution<a class=link href=file:///C:/Users/kiran/Documents/Commission%20migration%20paper.doc#_ftn2>[2]</a> highlight the consensus for swift action to save lives and strengthen the EU&rsquo;s response. This immediate action must also guide the EU&rsquo;s approach to future crises, wherever they may arise along our shared external borders.</p><p><em>Saving lives at sea</em></p><p>Europe cannot stand idly by as lives are lost at sea. Search and rescue efforts will be intensified to reach the level of intervention previously provided by Italy&rsquo;s &lsquo;Mare Nostrum&rsquo; operation. The Commission has already proposed an amended 2015 budget to triple the funding for Frontex joint operations Triton and Poseidon. A proposal for 2016 will be presented by the end of May. These actions will expand the capacity and geographic reach of these operations, enabling Frontex to coordinate operational border support to Member States under pressure while contributing to saving lives at sea.<a class=link href=file:///C:/Users/kiran/Documents/Commission%20migration%20paper.doc#_ftn3>[3]</a> In addition to increased EU funding, several Member States are deploying assets such as ships and aircraft. This display of solidarity must be sustained as long as migratory pressure persists.</p><p>[explanation of new Triton mission to go here]</p><p><em>Targeting criminal smuggling networks</em></p><p>The criminal networks profiting from vulnerable migrants must be stopped. The High Representative/Vice President (HR/VP) has outlined options for potential Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) operations to systematically locate, apprehend, and dismantle vessels used by smugglers. This action, conducted under international law, will demonstrate the EU&rsquo;s resolve.</p><p>The EU will strengthen its efforts to gather and share information to identify and target smugglers. Europol will immediately bolster its Joint Maritime Information Operation (JOT MARE), the central hub for information on smuggling activities. This will establish a single point of contact for inter-agency cooperation.<a class=link href=file:///C:/Users/kiran/Documents/Commission%20migration%20paper.doc#_ftn4>[4]</a> Frontex and Europol will also create profiles of vessels potentially used by smugglers, analyzing patterns to identify and track their movements. Finally, Europol will identify and request the removal of illegal online content used by smugglers to lure migrants and refugees.</p><p><em>Responding to high-volumes of arrivals within the EU: Relocation</em></p><p>Member States&rsquo; asylum systems are facing extraordinary pressure. With the arrival of summer, the flow of people to frontline Member States is expected to increase. The EU must act before the pressure becomes overwhelming. The current volume of arrivals is already straining the capacity of local reception and processing facilities. By the end of May, the Commission will propose triggering the emergency response system outlined in Article 78.3 of the Treaty to address the situation in the Mediterranean. This proposal will include a distribution mechanism to ensure a fair and balanced allocation of individuals requiring international protection among Member States. The receiving Member State will be responsible for processing applications according to established rules and safeguards. A distribution key based on GDP, population, unemployment rate, and past numbers of asylum seekers is included in the Annex.</p><p>This step will pave the way for a sustainable solution. The EU requires a permanent system to share responsibility for large numbers of refugees and asylum seekers among Member States. The Commission will propose legislation by the end of 2015 for a mandatory, automatically-triggered relocation system to distribute individuals requiring international protection within the EU in times of mass influx. This system will consider existing voluntary efforts by Member States.</p><p>Until these measures are implemented, Member States must demonstrate solidarity and enhance their support for frontline countries.</p><p><em>A common approach to granting protection to displaced persons in need of protection: Resettlement</em></p><p>In addition to relocating those already within EU borders, the EU must contribute its fair share in aiding displaced persons needing international protection. This is a shared responsibility within the international community, with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) tasked with identifying those unable to remain safely in their home countries. We cannot allow such vulnerable individuals to fall prey to criminal smuggling and trafficking networks; there must be safe and legal ways for them to reach the EU. The UNHCR has endorsed a target of 20,000 resettlement places for the EU per year by 2020.<a class=link href=file:///C:/Users/kiran/Documents/Commission%20migration%20paper.doc#_ftn5>[5]</a> While some Member States have made significant contributions to global resettlement efforts, others have not and are not providing alternative support through accepting asylum requests or funding the efforts of others.</p><p>The Commission will issue a Recommendation by the end of May proposing an EU-wide resettlement scheme offering xxx places. This scheme will encompass all Member States, with a distribution formula based on factors such as GDP, population, unemployment rate, and past numbers of asylum seekers. It will also consider the voluntary efforts already made by Member States. The EU budget will dedicate an additional ‚Ç¨50 million in 2015/2016 to support this scheme. A binding legislative approach beyond 2016 will be proposed if necessary. In addition to this collective effort, Member States are urged to utilize existing options under the Asylum Migration and Integration Fund and pledge additional resettlement places through their national programs, with funding adjusted accordingly.</p><p>Furthermore, Member States should fully utilize other legal avenues for those needing protection, including private sponsorships, humanitarian permits, and family reunification provisions.</p><p><em>Working with third countries to tackle migration upstream</em></p><p>The EU can also take immediate action to address migration at its source in origin and transit regions. The Commission and the European External Action Service (EEAS) will collaborate with partner countries to implement concrete measures for processing migrants before they reach EU borders.</p><p>First, the EU should bolster its support to countries facing the greatest influx of displaced refugees. Starting with North Africa and the Horn of Africa, Regional Development and Protection Programs will be established or expanded. ‚Ç¨30 million will be allocated in 2015/2016, and Member States are encouraged to contribute further.</p><p>Second, a pilot multi-purpose center will be operational in Niger by year&rsquo;s end. In collaboration with the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), the UNHCR, and Niger authorities, the center will provide information, local protection, and resettlement opportunities for those in need. Such centers in origin and transit countries would offer a realistic picture of the likely success of migration journeys and provide assisted voluntary return options for irregular migrants.</p><p>Third, migration will become a specific focus of existing Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) missions in countries like Niger and Mali, with strengthened border management efforts. A dedicated summit will be held in Malta this autumn with key partners, including the African Union, to develop a shared approach to addressing the root causes of irregular migration, protecting those in need, and combating smuggling and trafficking.</p><p>These efforts will be closely linked to broader political initiatives aimed at promoting stability. Of paramount importance is the HR/VP&rsquo;s work in addressing the situation in Libya, with full support for UN-led efforts to establish a Government of National Unity. Persistent efforts to resolve the Syrian crisis have been accompanied by ‚Ç¨3.6 billion in humanitarian, stabilization, and development assistance within Syria and to Syrian refugees in neighboring countries. These are just a few of the political crises that will have a significant impact on migration to the EU in the coming months.</p><p><em>Using the EU&rsquo;s tools to help frontline Member States</em></p><p>Further action will be taken to support frontline Member States facing the immediate challenges of migrant arrivals.</p><p>Firstly, the Commission will implement a &ldquo;Hotspot&rdquo; approach. The European Asylum Support Office (EASO), Frontex, and Europol will work on the ground with frontline Member States to promptly identify, register, and fingerprint arriving migrants. These agencies will work in a complementary manner. Those seeking asylum will be guided directly into the asylum procedure with assistance from EASO support teams to expedite case processing. Frontex will help coordinate the return of irregular migrants not in need of protection. Europol and Eurojust will assist the host Member State in dismantling the smuggling and trafficking networks.</p><p>Secondly, the Commission will mobilize an additional ‚Ç¨60 million in emergency funding to support reception and healthcare systems in Member States facing particular pressure. <a class=link href=file:///C:/Users/kiran/Documents/Commission%20migration%20paper.doc#_ftn6>[6]</a> An assessment of needs is underway.</p><p><strong><em>Key Actions</em></strong></p><ul><li>A funding package to triple the resources for Triton and Poseidon in 2015-16 and to finance an EU-wide resettlement scheme.</li><li>Immediate support for a possible CSDP mission to combat migrant smuggling.</li><li>A proposal to activate the emergency mechanism under Article 78(3) TFEU by the end of May, using the distribution key in the Annex.</li><li>A proposal for a permanent, common EU system for relocation by the end of 2015.</li><li>A Recommendation for an EU resettlement scheme by the end of May, followed, if needed, by a proposal for a more permanent approach beyond 2016.</li><li>‚Ç¨30 million for Regional Development and Protection Programs.</li><li>Establishment of a pilot Multi-purpose Center in Niger by the end of 2015.</li></ul><p><strong>II. Four pillars to manage migration better</strong></p><p>The migration crisis in the Mediterranean has highlighted immediate needs but also exposed the structural weaknesses of EU migration policy and its instruments. This is an opportunity for the EU to establish a balanced and effective migration policy and demonstrate to its citizens that migration can be better managed collectively.</p><p>The EU must continue offering protection to those in need while recognizing that the skills required for a thriving economy may not always be readily available within the EU labor market. Legally admitted migrants should not face barriers to integration but should receive full support in becoming part of their new communities. This is central to the values Europeans hold dear and should project globally.</p><p>At the same time, the EU must address situations where migrants do not meet the criteria to stay. Unsuccessful asylum seekers avoiding return, visa overstayers, and migrants living in a constant state of irregularity present a serious challenge. This undermines confidence in the system and fuels criticism and stigmatization of migration, making it harder to integrate migrants who have the right to stay.</p><p>This Agenda outlines four levels of action for a fair, robust, and realistic EU migration policy. Once implemented,<a class=link href=file:///C:/Users/kiran/Documents/Commission%20migration%20paper.doc#_ftn7>[7]</a> these actions will establish a migration policy that respects the right to seek asylum, responds to humanitarian needs, provides a clear European framework for a common migration policy, and is sustainable in the long term.</p><p><strong>II.1 Reducing the incentives for irregular migration</strong></p><p>The motivations behind irregular migration are many and varied, but it often leads to disappointment. The journey is frequently far more perilous than anticipated, with migrants at the mercy of criminal networks prioritizing profit over human life. Those whose asylum claims are rejected face the prospect of return, while those living clandestinely in Europe face a precarious existence and exploitation. Addressing the root causes of migration, dismantling smuggling and trafficking networks, and providing clarity and predictability in return policies are in everyone&rsquo;s interest.</p><p><em>Addressing the root causes in third countries</em></p><p>Many root causes of migration are deeply embedded in global issues that the EU has been striving to address for years. Migration highlights the direct impact of an active and engaged EU external policy on its citizens. Civil war, persecution, and climate change directly contribute to migration, making their prevention and mitigation crucial considerations in the migration debate. This will be a major focus of the HR/VP&rsquo;s Strategic Review, which assesses the impact of global changes, and the upcoming review of the European Neighbourhood Policy.</p><p>Partnership with origin and transit countries is vital, and several bilateral and regional cooperation frameworks on migration are already in place (Rabat Process, Khartoum Process, Budapest Process, EU-Africa Migration and Mobility Dialogue). These frameworks will be enhanced by strengthening the role of EU Delegations in key countries on migration matters. Delegations will report on major migration-related developments in host countries, integrate migration issues into development cooperation, and engage with host countries to ensure coordinated action. European migration liaison officers will be deployed to EU Delegations in key third countries, working closely with the Immigration Liaison Officers Network<a class=link href=file:///C:/Users/kiran/Documents/Commission%20migration%20paper.doc#_ftn8>[8]</a>, local authorities, and civil society to gather, share, and analyze information. As a first step, liaison officers will be deployed to Egypt, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Niger, Senegal, Sudan, Turkey, Pakistan, Lebanon, and Jordan.</p><p>Turkey exemplifies the potential benefits of enhanced cooperation. Since early 2014, Turkey has received ‚Ç¨79 million to manage the strain on its refugee system and prevent dangerous journeys across the Eastern Mediterranean. The deployment of a dedicated Frontex liaison officer to Turkey will further strengthen this cooperation.</p><p>With a budget of ‚Ç¨82 billion for 2014-2020, EU external cooperation assistance plays a crucial role in addressing global challenges like poverty, insecurity, inequality, and unemployment, including support for some of the world&rsquo;s most troubled areas.</p><p>In addition to tackling long-term root causes, the EU helps mitigate the impact of crises at the local level. This requires sustained effort, as over 70% of the world&rsquo;s refugees are displaced for five years or more. The EU is a leading international donor for refugees, with ‚Ç¨200 million in ongoing development assistance projects and over ‚Ç¨1 billion in humanitarian aid allocated to refugees and Internally Displaced Persons since the beginning of 2014. A strategic review is underway to maximize the impact of this support, with results expected in 2016.</p><p><em>The fight against smugglers and traffickers</em></p><p>Combatting criminal smuggling and trafficking networks is crucial to protecting migrants from exploitation.<a class=link href=file:///C:/Users/kiran/Documents/Commission%20migration%20paper.doc#_ftn9>[9]</a> It would also deter irregular migration. The goal is to shift smuggling networks from &ldquo;low risk, high return&rdquo; operations to &ldquo;high risk, low return&rdquo; endeavors for criminals. The Commission will present an action plan by the end of May.</p><p>Cooperation with third countries is paramount. Most smugglers operate outside Europe, and those apprehended on boats in the Mediterranean are often the final link in the chain. Collaboration to dismantle local and international criminal groups controlling smuggling routes will be a major focus of the intensified cooperation outlined above.</p><p>EU agencies can also assist Member States in intensifying action against criminal smuggling networks. These agencies help identify, investigate, prosecute, and freeze the assets of smugglers. Building on immediate efforts to locate, apprehend, and disable vessels used by criminal networks, the EU will enhance cooperation with Financial Intelligence Units on financial flows to support proactive financial investigations aimed at seizing and recovering criminal assets and combating money laundering linked to migrant smuggling. Cooperation with financial institutions, such as banks, money transfer services, and credit card companies, will also be strengthened. This will draw on the improved information sharing outlined in the European Agenda on Security.</p><p>To empower prosecutors in tackling smuggling networks, the Commission will strengthen the existing EU legal framework against migrant smuggling and those who profit from it.<a class=link href=file:///C:/Users/kiran/Documents/Commission%20migration%20paper.doc#_ftn10>[10]</a> The Commission will also complete initiatives outlined in the current strategy against Trafficking in Human Beings and explore further improvements in 2016 to target trafficking networks and assist victims. The exploitation of migrants by employers within the EU is another area of concern. The Commission will outline additional measures, such as increased workplace inspections, to better enforce the Employers Sanctions Directive,<a class=link href=file:///C:/Users/kiran/Documents/Commission%20migration%20paper.doc#_ftn11>[11]</a> which prohibits employing third-country nationals without legal residence in the EU. Infringement procedures related to this Directive will be prioritized.</p><p><em>Return</em></p><p>The EU&rsquo;s inefficient return system for irregular migrants and those whose asylum claims are rejected serves as an incentive for irregular migration. Smugglers exploit the fact that only a fraction of return decisions are enforced ‚Äì just 39.2% in 2013.</p><p>Improving enforcement starts with ensuring that third countries fulfill their international obligation to readmit their own citizens residing illegally in Europe. <a class=link href=file:///C:/Users/kiran/Documents/Commission%20migration%20paper.doc#_ftn12>[12]</a> The EU should utilize all available leverage and incentives. The recently agreed-upon Pilot Project on Return will provide valuable practical experience.<a class=link href=file:///C:/Users/kiran/Documents/Commission%20migration%20paper.doc#_ftn13>[13]</a> The EU will assist third countries in meeting their obligations through capacity building for return management, information and awareness campaigns, and support for reintegration measures. The Commission will also review its approach to readmission agreements,<a class=link href=file:///C:/Users/kiran/Documents/Commission%20migration%20paper.doc#_ftn14>[14]</a> prioritizing key countries of origin for irregular migrants.</p><p>Member States must also implement the Return Directive. The Commission will prioritize monitoring the Directive&rsquo;s implementation, ensuring a swifter return system that respects procedural safeguards and standards. This approach ensures humane and dignified treatment of returnees, proportionate use of coercive measures, and alignment with fundamental rights and the principle of <em>non-refoulement</em><a class=link href=file:///C:/Users/kiran/Documents/Commission%20migration%20paper.doc#_ftn15>[15]</a>. New rules on returning irregular migrants are being established under the Schengen Evaluation Mechanism, and a &ldquo;Return Handbook&rdquo; will provide Member States with common guidelines, best practices, and recommendations.</p><p>While common EU rules on return exist, effective operational cooperation is lacking. Frontex currently provides significant support to Member States, but its mandate needs strengthening to provide more comprehensive operational assistance. Currently, Frontex can only coordinate return missions, not initiate them. Based on an ongoing evaluation concluding this year, the Commission will propose amending the Frontex legal basis to enhance its role in return.</p><p><strong><em>Key Actions</em></strong></p><ul><li>Prioritizing migration as a core issue for EU delegations.</li><li>An action plan on smuggling to be presented in May 2015.</li><li>Stronger action to ensure that third countries fulfill their obligations to readmit their nationals.</li><li>Adoption of a return handbook and monitoring of the Return Directive&rsquo;s implementation.</li><li>Reinforcement and amendment of the Frontex legal basis to strengthen its role in return.</li></ul><p><strong>II.2 Border management ‚Äì saving lives and</strong> <strong>securing external borders</strong></p><p>The measures described above to address the current situation in the Mediterranean are emergency responses to a specific crisis. It would be unrealistic to assume this is a temporary issue. Strengthening Frontex and establishing new forms of cooperation with Member States represent a level of support and solidarity that must be maintained. The rules of engagement established for Triton should serve as a model for future action. While each crisis is unique, the EU must learn from this experience and be prepared to act proactively, not just reactively.</p><p>Identifying risk trends is increasingly vital for effective operational preparedness. The implementation of Eurosur<a class=link href=file:///C:/Users/kiran/Documents/Commission%20migration%20paper.doc#_ftn16>[16]</a> provides a solid foundation and should be fully utilized by all civilian and military authorities responsible for maritime border surveillance. Relevant agencies should develop a comprehensive situational picture to inform policymaking and response preparation at national and European levels. <a class=link href=file:///C:/Users/kiran/Documents/Commission%20migration%20paper.doc#_ftn17>[17]</a></p><p>The EU has an established policy of assisting Member States in building secure and consistent external borders. The Internal Security Fund will provide over ‚Ç¨2.7 billion to Member States between 2014 and 2020. However, while border control regulations exist, current border management practices vary and rely on a patchwork of sectoral documents and instruments. In 2016, the Commission will consolidate this into a Union standard for border management, encompassing all aspects of the EU&rsquo;s external border management.</p><p>Efficient border management also entails leveraging IT systems and technologies. The EU currently utilizes three large-scale IT systems for asylum administration (Eurodac), visa applications (Visa Information System), and sharing information on individuals or objects flagged by authorities (Schengen Information System). Full utilization of these systems can benefit border management, reduce irregular migration, and enhance the EU&rsquo;s capacity to return irregular migrants.</p><p>The &ldquo;Smart Borders&rdquo; initiative represents the next phase, aiming to improve the efficiency of border crossings by facilitating travel for the vast majority of legitimate third-country travelers while strengthening the fight against irregular migration through a record of all cross-border movements by third-country nationals, fully respecting proportionality. Following initial discussions and considering concerns raised by co-legislators, the Commission plans to present a revised Smart Borders proposal in early 2016.</p><p>Developing high standards within the EU will make it easier to support third countries in developing their own border management solutions. Initiatives in key African and neighboring countries could receive support from Frontex, EU funding, and related initiatives within the framework of EU neighborhood and development policies. The objective is to promote more secure borders and strengthen the capacity of North African countries to intervene and save the lives of migrants in distress.</p><p><strong><em>Key Actions</em></strong></p><ul><li>Strengthening Frontex&rsquo;s role and capacity.</li><li>Establishing a Union Standard for border management.</li><li>Presenting a revised proposal on Smart Borders.</li><li>Strengthening the capacity of third countries to manage their borders.</li></ul><p><strong>II.3. Europe&rsquo;s duty to protect: a strong common asylum policy</strong></p><p>The EU needs a clear system for receiving asylum seekers. A record 600,000 people applied for asylum in the EU in 2014. All asylum applications must be processed, and protection granted to those eligible. The current policy suffers from a lack of mutual trust between Member States, stemming from the fragmentation of the asylum system. This encourages &ldquo;asylum shopping&rdquo; and undermines public confidence in the system, creating the perception that it is fundamentally unfair. The EU already has common rules that should foster mutual confidence, and further development of these rules will allow for a fresh start.</p><p><em>A coherent implementation of the Common European Asylum System</em></p><p>Ensuring full and consistent implementation of the Common European Asylum System is crucial. This will be supported by a new, systematic monitoring process to assess the implementation and application of asylum rules and foster mutual trust. In collaboration with Member States and the European Asylum Support Office (EASO), the Commission will provide further guidance on improving reception conditions and asylum procedures. This includes providing Member States with clear and concise quality indicators and strengthening the protection of asylum seekers&rsquo; fundamental rights, particularly for vulnerable groups such as children.<a class=link href=file:///C:/Users/kiran/Documents/Commission%20migration%20paper.doc#_ftn18>[18]</a> The Commission will prioritize the transposition and practical implementation of recently adopted legislation on asylum rules when considering infringement procedures.</p><p>EASO will expand its practical cooperation, acting as a central hub for national Country of Origin Information, the factual basis for asylum decisions. This will promote greater consistency in decision-making. Other key measures include training<a class=link href=file:///C:/Users/kiran/Documents/Commission%20migration%20paper.doc#_ftn19>[19]</a> and a new dedicated network of reception authorities, potentially laying the groundwork for pooling reception places during emergencies.</p><p>A more effective approach to addressing abuses is also essential for strengthening the Common European Asylum System. The number of unfounded claims is too high: in 2014, 55% of asylum applications were rejected, with rejection rates nearing 100% for some nationalities. This hinders the ability of Member States to provide timely protection to those genuinely in need. Existing legislation includes provisions to combat abuse, such as expedited processing for unfounded applications. The Commission will work with EASO and Member States to develop guidelines that maximize the use of these provisions.</p><p>Another challenge arises from asylum applications submitted by third-country nationals who do not require visas to enter the EU. While addressed in part through post-visa liberalization monitoring mechanisms,<a class=link href=file:///C:/Users/kiran/Documents/Commission%20migration%20paper.doc#_ftn20>[20]</a> the Commission will explore whether to strengthen the Safe Country of Origin provisions of the Asylum Procedure Directive to enable faster processing of asylum seekers from designated safe countries.</p><p><em>Dublin system - greater responsibility sharing across Member States</em></p><p>Despite recent legal improvements in 2014, the &ldquo;Dublin system,&rdquo;<a class=link href=file:///C:/Users/kiran/Documents/Commission%20migration%20paper.doc#_ftn21>[21]</a> which governs the allocation of responsibility for examining asylum applications, is not functioning optimally. In 2014, just five Member States processed 72% of all asylum applications in the EU. While the EU can provide additional assistance, the rules must be fully implemented.</p><p>Member States are responsible for implementing the Dublin system. They should allocate adequate resources to increase the number of transfers, reduce processing times, consistently apply family reunification clauses, and utilize discretionary clauses that allow them to examine asylum applications and alleviate the burden on frontline Member States. At the EU level, EASO will support Member States by establishing a dedicated network of national Dublin Units.</p><p>Member States must also enforce rules regarding the fingerprinting of migrants at borders. The Hotspot system will provide on-the-ground operational support to Member States facing significant pressure. By the end of May, the Commission will provide guidance to facilitate systematic fingerprinting, in full compliance with fundamental rights, supported by practical cooperation and exchange of best practices. The Commission will also explore expanding the use of biometric identifiers within the Eurodac system, such as facial recognition technology using digital photographs.</p><p>The context in which the Dublin system was designed has changed. The current scale and nature of migration flows differ significantly from what Europe faced previously. When evaluating the Dublin system in 2016, the Commission will consider the experiences of the relocation and resettlement mechanisms to determine if the legal parameters of Dublin need revision to achieve a fairer distribution of asylum seekers within Europe.</p><p><strong><em>Key Actions</em></strong></p><ul><li>Establishing a new monitoring and evaluation system for the Common European Asylum System and providing guidance to improve standards for reception conditions and asylum procedures.</li><li>Developing guidelines to combat abuses of the asylum system.</li><li>Implementing measures to promote the systematic identification and fingerprinting of migrants.</li><li>Expanding the use of biometric identifiers within the Eurodac system.</li><li>Evaluating the Dublin Regulation in 2016.</li></ul><p><strong>II.4 A new policy on legal migration</strong></p><p>The EU faces numerous long-term economic challenges, including an aging population and an economy increasingly reliant on highly skilled workers. The proportion of jobs requiring higher education is projected to increase dramatically (by 23%) between 2012 and 2025.<a class=link href=file:///C:/Users/kiran/Documents/Commission%20migration%20paper.doc#_ftn22>[22]</a> This puts Europe in competition with other economies to attract skilled workers, and shortages are already evident in key sectors such as science, technology, and engineering. While the EU must develop its own skills base and prepare its citizens for the modern labor market ‚Äì efforts that include the Commission&rsquo;s presentation of a new Labour Mobility Package in 2015 ‚Äì these efforts will likely fall short of meeting the demand: without migration, the EU&rsquo;s working-age population is projected to decline by 17.5 million over the next decade. Migration will play an increasingly vital role in supplying the EU economy with the talent necessary for sustainable growth.</p><p>Promoting legal migration is always challenging in times of high unemployment and social change. This underscores the importance of a clear, rigorous, and common system that reflects the EU&rsquo;s interests, including maintaining Europe&rsquo;s attractiveness as a destination for migrants.<a class=link href=file:///C:/Users/kiran/Documents/Commission%20migration%20paper.doc#_ftn23>[23]</a></p><p><em>Well managed regular migration and visa policy</em></p><p>Decisions regarding the number of third-country nationals admitted for work will remain the sole responsibility of Member States. However, the EU has a specific role to play. Over the next seven years, European programs like Horizon 2020 and Erasmus+ will attract talented individuals to the EU. The Directive on Students and Researchers, currently under negotiation, aims to provide these groups with new mobility and job-seeking opportunities. Swift adoption of this legislation would signal to these strategically important groups that the EU welcomes their contributions.</p><p>The next step should be an attractive EU-wide scheme for highly qualified third-country nationals. While the Blue Card Directive provides such a framework, it has been underutilized, with only 16,000 Blue Cards issued in its first two years, 13,000 of which were issued by a single Member State. The Commission will launch a public consultation on the Blue Card Directive by the end of May. A review of the Directive will examine ways to make it more effective in attracting talent to Europe, potentially including expanding the scope to cover entrepreneurs investing in Europe or improving intra-EU mobility for Blue Card holders.</p><p>The services sector, which includes highly skilled foreign professionals requiring short-term travel to the EU, also has a significant economic impact. The Commission will explore ways to provide legal certainty for these individuals, strengthening the EU&rsquo;s position when negotiating reciprocal arrangements in Free Trade Agreements (FTAs).</p><p>The role of Member States in these decisions necessitates a more direct and open dialogue to foster shared understanding, policy approaches, and the exchange of best practices at the European level. The Commission will support Member States in establishing a permanent dialogue and peer evaluation mechanism on labor market gaps, regularization, and integration ‚Äì issues where decisions by one Member State can impact others. The Commission will also establish a platform for dialogue with businesses, trade unions, and other social partners to maximize the benefits of migration for the European economy and migrants themselves.</p><p>The EU needs tools to identify economic sectors and occupations currently facing or expected to face recruitment difficulties and skills gaps. While existing tools provide some insight, a more comprehensive picture is needed.<a class=link href=file:///C:/Users/kiran/Documents/Commission%20migration%20paper.doc#_ftn24>[24]</a> Current web portals, such as the EU Migration portal and Europe‚Äôs Job Mobility Portal (EURES), can also play a role in facilitating job matching for third-country nationals already residing in the EU. One obstacle to matching skills effectively is the lack of recognition for qualifications obtained by migrants in their home countries. The EU can assist in improving the understanding and recognition of qualifications from outside the EU.<a class=link href=file:///C:/Users/kiran/Documents/Commission%20migration%20paper.doc#_ftn25>[25]</a></p><p>These efforts to develop a new legal migration policy align with the modernization of EU visa policy.<a class=link href=file:///C:/Users/kiran/Documents/Commission%20migration%20paper.doc#_ftn26>[26]</a> In 2014, the Commission proposed a revised Visa Code and a new Touring Visa.<a class=link href=file:///C:/Users/kiran/Documents/Commission%20migration%20paper.doc#_ftn27>[27]</a> Adopting these proposals will provide the EU with greater flexibility in its visa policy, maximizing the economic benefits of attracting tourists and visitors while minimizing the risks of irregular migration and security concerns. By the end of 2015, the Commission will complete its review of visa requirements for different nationalities and may propose lifting visa requirements for some countries, on a reciprocal basis, or reinstating them for others. This decision will consider ongoing political dialogues with key countries on migration and mobility.</p><p><em>Effective integration</em></p><p>Effective integration policies are essential for the success of any migration policy. While integration is primarily the responsibility of Member States, the European Union can support national governments, local authorities, and civil society organizations involved in the complex and long-term process of fostering integration and mutual trust.</p><p>The Asylum Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) provides funding, and the European Social Fund (ESF) can play a particularly important role.<a class=link href=file:///C:/Users/kiran/Documents/Commission%20migration%20paper.doc#_ftn28>[28]</a> For the 2014-2020 programming period, at least 20% of ESF resources will be allocated to social inclusion, including measures to integrate migrants, with a focus on asylum seekers and refugees.<a class=link href=file:///C:/Users/kiran/Documents/Commission%20migration%20paper.doc#_ftn29>[29]</a> These funds can support targeted initiatives to improve language skills, enhance professional development, promote access to the labor market, foster intercultural exchange, and raise awareness among both host communities and migrants.</p><p><em>Maximising the development benefits for countries of origin</em></p><p>The EU&rsquo;s legal migration policy should also benefit the development of migrants&rsquo; countries of origin. The United Nations will soon adopt Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which should include migration-related targets alongside targets for decent work, youth employment, and wage and social protection policies that can help create better economic opportunities in these countries. This complements the work of EU Mobility Partnerships[[30]](file</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-tags></section><section class=article-copyright><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="icon icon-tabler icon-tabler-copyright" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="2" stroke="currentcolor" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path stroke="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="9"/><path d="M14.5 9a3.5 4 0 100 6"/></svg>
