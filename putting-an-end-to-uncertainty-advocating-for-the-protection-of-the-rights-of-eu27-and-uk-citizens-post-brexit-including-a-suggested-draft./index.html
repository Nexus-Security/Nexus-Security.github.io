Should this occur, the question arises: what will happen to the provisions concerning EU27 citizens residing in the UK, and UK citizens residing in the EU27, prior to Brexit?</p><p>To provide maximum assurance regarding their immigration status, there is a compelling rationale for separating these provisions from the main withdrawal agreement and ratifying them under a distinct agreement. This approach ensures their enforcement regardless of the outcome of negotiations on the remaining aspects of the withdrawal agreement. While this initiative might not be immediately feasible (as certain aspects of citizens&rsquo; rights still require mutual agreement), it remains a viable option if the primary discussions collapse, whether before or after Brexit. Notably, a treaty enacted after Brexit could be given retroactive effect from Brexit Day if deemed necessary.</p><p>Moreover, advocating for an independent agreement on this issue at an early stage could foster a more favorable atmosphere for the broader negotiations. The party initiating this gesture would demonstrate goodwill towards the citizens of the other party.</p><p>Are there legal ramifications to consider? One could argue that Article 50 solely references a single &ldquo;agreement.&rdquo; However, legal interpretation sometimes permits the singular form to encompass the plural. Furthermore, it&rsquo;s plausible that an agreement on citizens&rsquo; rights might be the sole point of consensus. If so, it&rsquo;s reasonable to infer that the drafters of Article 50 envisioned other issues being addressed. Asserting that Article 50 mandates an &ldquo;all or nothing&rdquo; approach to matters arising from a Member State&rsquo;s withdrawal, thereby preventing its application to resolving only a subset of those matters, seems illogical.</p><p>A treaty enacted post-Brexit would fall under the Treaties&rsquo; immigration provisions. Although Article 79(5) TFEU grants Member States authority over the volume of individuals entering their territory for work, this treaty would pertain solely to those already residing within the territory, thereby avoiding infringement upon national sovereignty.</p><p>Should any uncertainties arise regarding these legal aspects, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) could be called upon for resolution using its authority under Article 218 TFEU. This provision allows the ECJ to provide preliminary rulings on draft treaties before they take effect. The submission of the draft agreement makes the content of the proposed agreement sufficiently clear for the ECJ to exercise its jurisdiction (finalized negotiations are not a prerequisite for the Court&rsquo;s involvement).</p><p>To aid those interested in exploring this concept further, a draft of a legally protected agreement has been prepared. This draft utilizes the text from the European Commission&rsquo;s proposal for the withdrawal agreement, incorporating only the necessary modifications to reflect the agreement&rsquo;s limited focus. For instance, all mentions of a transition period have been removed, assuming either its absence (in a &ldquo;no deal&rdquo; outcome) or its inclusion within the main withdrawal agreement (in a scenario with &ldquo;multiple deals&rdquo;). Additional necessary adjustments are noted as comments within the Articles.</p><p>For clarity, this draft refrains from suggesting any substantial changes to the European Commission&rsquo;s text at this juncture, though some revisions might be beneficial and could be proposed shortly. The text is subject to modification during negotiations.</p><p>Barnard & Peers: chapter 26, chapter 27, chapter 13</p><p>Photo credit: Business Insider</p><p>*This blog post was supported by an ESRC priority grant on &ldquo;Brexit and UK/EU immigration policy&rdquo; </p><p>Annex – proposed text of Treaty</p><p>PREAMBLE</p><p>THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND,</p><p>[…]</p><p>HAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:</p><p>PART ONE</p><p>COMMON PROVISIONS</p><p>Article 1</p><p>Objective</p><p>This Agreement outlines the procedures for safeguarding citizens&rsquo; rights following the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (&ldquo;United Kingdom&rdquo;) from the European Union (“Union”) and from the European Atomic Energy Community (“Euratom”).</p><p><em>Comment: The phrase</em> “<em>for the protection of citizens’ rights</em>” <em>was added to Article 1 of the Commission&rsquo;s draft due to the restricted scope of this proposed treaty.</em></p><p>Article 2</p><p>Definitions</p><p>For the purposes of this Agreement, the following definitions shall apply:</p><p>(a) &ldquo;Union law&rdquo; means:</p><p>(i) the Treaty on European Union (&ldquo;TEU&rdquo;), the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (&ldquo;TFEU&rdquo;) and the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community (&ldquo;Euratom Treaty&rdquo;), as amended or supplemented, as well as the Treaties of Accession and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, together referred to as “the Treaties”;</p><p>(ii) the general principles of Union law;</p><p>(iii) the acts adopted by the institutions, bodies, offices or agencies of the Union;</p><p>(iv) the international agreements to which the Union or Euratom is party and the international agreements concluded by the Member States acting on behalf of the Union or Euratom;</p><p>(v) the agreements between Member States entered into in their capacity as Member States of the Union or of Euratom; and</p><p>(vi) acts of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States meeting within the European Council or the Council of the European Union (&ldquo;Council&rdquo;);</p><p>(vii) the declarations made in the context of intergovernmental conferences which adopted the Treaties.</p><p>(b) &ldquo;Member States&rdquo; means the Kingdom of Belgium, the Republic of Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Kingdom of Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Republic of Estonia, Ireland, the Hellenic Republic, the Kingdom of Spain, the French Republic, the Republic of Croatia, the Italian Republic, the Republic of Cyprus, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, Hungary, the Republic of Malta, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Republic of Austria, the Republic of Poland, the Portuguese Republic, Romania, the Republic of Slovenia, the Slovak Republic, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden;</p><p>(c) &ldquo;Union citizen&rdquo; means any person holding the nationality of a Member State;</p><p>(d) &ldquo;United Kingdom national&rdquo; means a British citizen, as defined in the New Declaration by the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland of 31 December 1982 on the definition of the term ‘nationals’ together with Declaration No 63 annexed to the Final Act of the intergovernmental conference which adopted the Treaty of Lisbon.</p><p>Article 3</p><p>Territorial scope</p><ol><li>Unless stated otherwise in this Agreement or in applicable Union law, any reference to the United Kingdom or its territory shall be interpreted as referring to:</li></ol><p>(a) the United Kingdom;</p><p>(b) the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, Gibraltar and the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia in Cyprus, to the extent that Union law pertinent to this agreement applied to them before this Agreement&rsquo;s effective date;</p><p>(c) the overseas countries and territories enumerated in Annex II to the TFEU maintaining special relations with the United Kingdom, when the provisions of this Agreement pertain to the special arrangements for the association of the overseas countries and territories with the Union.</p><ol start=2><li>Unless stipulated otherwise in this Agreement or in relevant Union law, any reference to Member States, or their territory, shall be construed as encompassing the territories of the Member States to which the Treaties apply as outlined in Article 355 TFEU.</li></ol><p><em>Comment: In the interest of clarity, the phrase &ldquo;relevant to this agreement&rdquo; was inserted into para 1(b).</em></p><p>Article 4</p><p>Methods and principles pertaining to the effect, implementation, and application of this Agreement</p><p>1.
