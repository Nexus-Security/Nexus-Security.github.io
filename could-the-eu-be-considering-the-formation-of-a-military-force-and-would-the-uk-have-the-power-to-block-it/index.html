This debate, while heated, often lacks clarity. This piece aims to provide a clear understanding of the situation, concluding that the recent proposals don&rsquo;t constitute an EU army, making a UK veto irrelevant.</p><p><strong>Background</strong></p><p>The EU&rsquo;s foreign policy initially avoided defense matters, respecting Irish neutrality and the UK&rsquo;s commitment to NATO. This stance shifted post-Cold War with the departure of US troops and the decline of the Western European Union.</p><p>The Lisbon Treaty, specifically Articles 42-46 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), currently governs EU defense policy. These articles establish the EU&rsquo;s &ldquo;operational capacity&rdquo; for non-EU missions like peacekeeping, utilizing resources from member states, which retain their individual armed forces. While the option exists for multinational forces, their formation and contribution to EU defense remain voluntary.</p><p>A &ldquo;common Union defence policy&rdquo; is mentioned as a long-term goal, eventually leading to a &ldquo;common defence.&rdquo; However, this objective must respect the NATO commitments of member states and cannot undermine the neutral stance of certain members. Crucially, achieving this &ldquo;common defence&rdquo; requires unanimous agreement from the European Council (comprising national leaders) and ratification according to each member state&rsquo;s constitution. This would necessitate referendums in both the UK and Ireland due to their respective constitutional stipulations.</p><p>Article 42(3) outlines interim steps before a &ldquo;common defence,&rdquo; including gradual military capability improvement by member states, facilitated by a &ldquo;European Defence Agency.&rdquo; Provisions exist for groups of member states to handle EU-wide tasks and for mutual aid in case of armed aggression against a member state. Furthermore, member states meeting specific military capabilities criteria can engage in &ldquo;permanent structured cooperation.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>New EU plans</strong></p><p>Despite claims of an &ldquo;EU army,&rdquo; suggesting a &ldquo;common defence,&rdquo; being planned, the available information indicates otherwise. The UK, therefore, cannot veto a non-existent proposal.</p><p>Commission President Juncker&rsquo;s &ldquo;State of the Union&rdquo; address proposed four specific measures: a joint headquarters for EU military missions, cost-saving joint procurement, a defense fund, and the advancement of &ldquo;permanent structured cooperation.&rdquo; Notably absent was any proposal for merging armies. Similarly, the recent EU summit&rsquo;s &ldquo;Declaration&rdquo; and &ldquo;Road Map&rdquo; omit any mention of a &ldquo;common military force.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Permanent structured cooperation,&rdquo; outlined in Article 46 TEU and an accompanying Protocol, involves voluntary participation from member states, allowing any unwilling state to abstain. The Protocol details criteria for joining, focusing on defense capacity development and the ability to contribute forces to EU operations swiftly. Participating countries commit to agreed-upon defense spending levels, equipment alignment, addressing capability gaps, and engaging in joint procurement. While significant, these measures do not equate to an EU army.</p><p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p><p>Current Commission plans and the EU summit declaration do not constitute an EU army, rendering a UK veto moot. An empty threat holds no value in negotiations.</p><p>A more pragmatic approach would involve recognizing the potential for continued mutually beneficial defense and foreign policy collaboration between the UK and the EU post-Brexit. The UK should use its remaining time as a member state to provide constructive feedback on EU plans and propose sensible frameworks for future EU/UK cooperation in this domain.</p><p>Barnard & Peers: chapter 24</p><p>Photo credit:¬†http://www.lowyinterpreter.org/post/2015/03/16/A-European-Army.aspx</p><p><strong>Annex ‚Äì Treaty on European Union, defense clauses</strong></p><p>Article 42</p><p>1. The common security and defence policy shall be an integral part of the common foreign and security policy. It shall provide the Union with an operational capacity drawing on civilian and military assets. The Union may use them on missions outside the Union for peace-keeping, conflict prevention and strengthening international security in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter. The performance of these tasks shall be undertaken using capabilities provided by the Member States.</p><p>2. The common security and defence policy shall include the progressive framing of a common Union defence policy. This will lead to a common defence, when the European Council, acting unanimously, so decides. It shall in that case recommend to the Member States the adoption of such a decision in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements.</p><p>The policy of the Union in accordance with this Section shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain Member States and shall respect the obligations of certain Member States, which see their common defence realised in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), under the North Atlantic Treaty and be compatible with the common security and defence policy established within that framework.</p><p>3. Member States shall make civilian and military capabilities available to the Union for the implementation of the common security and defence policy, to contribute to the objectives defined by the Council. Those Member States which together establish multinational forces may also make them available to the common security and defence policy.</p><p>Member States shall undertake progressively to improve their military capabilities. The Agency in the field of defence capabilities development, research, acquisition and armaments (hereinafter referred to as ‚Äúthe European Defence Agency‚Äù) shall identify operational requirements, shall promote measures to satisfy those requirements, shall contribute to identifying and, where appropriate, implementing any measure needed to strengthen the industrial and technological base of the defence sector, shall participate in defining a European capabilities and armaments policy, and shall assist the Council in evaluating the improvement of military capabilities.</p><p>4. Decisions relating to the common security and defence policy, including those initiating a mission as referred to in this Article, shall be adopted by the Council acting unanimously on a proposal from the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy or an initiative from a Member State. The High Representative may propose the use of both national resources and Union instruments, together with the Commission where appropriate.</p><p>5. The Council may entrust the execution of a task, within the Union framework, to a group of Member States in order to protect the Union&rsquo;s values and serve its interests. The execution of such a task shall be governed by Article 44.</p><p>6. Those Member States whose military capabilities fulfil higher criteria and which have made more binding commitments to one another in this area with a view to the most demanding missions shall establish permanent structured cooperation within the Union framework. Such cooperation shall be governed by Article 46. It shall not affect the provisions of Article 43.</p><p>7. If a Member State is the victim of armed aggression on its territory, the other Member States shall have towards it an obligation of aid and assistance by all the means in their power, in accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. This shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain Member States.</p><p>Commitments and cooperation in this area shall be consistent with commitments under the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, which, for those States which are members of it, remains the foundation of their collective defence and the forum for its implementation.</p><p>Article 43</p><p>1. The tasks referred to in Article 42(1), in the course of which the Union may use civilian and military means, shall include joint disarmament operations, humanitarian and rescue tasks, military advice and assistance tasks, conflict prevention and peace-keeping tasks, tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peace-making and post-conflict stabilisation. All these tasks may contribute to the fight against terrorism, including by supporting third countries in combating terrorism in their territories.</p><p>2. The Council shall adopt decisions relating to the tasks referred to in paragraph 1, defining their objectives and scope and the general conditions for their implementation. The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, acting under the authority of the Council and in close and constant contact with the Political and Security Committee, shall ensure coordination of the civilian and military aspects of such tasks.</p><p>Article 44</p><p>1. Within the framework of the decisions adopted in accordance with Article 43, the Council may entrust the implementation of a task to a group of Member States which are willing and have the necessary capability for such a task. Those Member States, in association with the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, shall agree among themselves on the management of the task.</p><p>2. Member States participating in the task shall keep the Council regularly informed of its progress on their own initiative or at the request of another Member State. Those States shall inform the Council immediately should the completion of the task entail major consequences or require amendment of the objective, scope and conditions determined for the task in the decisions referred to in paragraph 1. In such cases, the Council shall adopt the necessary decisions.</p><p>Article 45</p><p>1. The European Defence Agency referred to in Article 42(3), subject to the authority of the Council, shall have as its task to:</p><p>(a) contribute to identifying the Member States&rsquo; military capability objectives and evaluating observance of the capability commitments given by the Member States;</p><p>(b) promote harmonisation of operational needs and adoption of effective, compatible procurement methods;</p><p>(c) propose multilateral projects to fulfil the objectives in terms of military capabilities, ensure coordination of the programmes implemented by the Member States and management of specific cooperation programmes;</p><p>(d) support defence technology research, and coordinate and plan joint research activities and the study of technical solutions meeting future operational needs;</p><p>(e) contribute to identifying and, if necessary, implementing any useful measure for strengthening the industrial and technological base of the defence sector and for improving the effectiveness of military expenditure.</p><p>2. The European Defence Agency shall be open to all Member States wishing to be part of it. The Council, acting by a qualified majority, shall adopt a decision defining the Agency&rsquo;s statute, seat and operational rules. That decision should take account of the level of effective participation in the Agency&rsquo;s activities. Specific groups shall be set up within the Agency bringing together Member States engaged in joint projects. The Agency shall carry out its tasks in liaison with the Commission where necessary.</p><p>Article 46</p><p>1. Those Member States which wish to participate in the permanent structured cooperation referred to in Article 42(6), which fulfil the criteria and have made the commitments on military capabilities set out in the Protocol on permanent structured cooperation, shall notify their intention to the Council and to the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.</p><p>2. Within three months following the notification referred to in paragraph 1 the Council shall adopt a decision establishing permanent structured cooperation and determining the list of participating Member States. The Council shall act by a qualified majority after consulting the High Representative.</p><p>3. Any Member State which, at a later stage, wishes to participate in the permanent structured cooperation shall notify its intention to the Council and to the High Representative.</p><p>The Council shall adopt a decision confirming the participation of the Member State concerned which fulfils the criteria and makes the commitments referred to in Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on permanent structured cooperation. The Council shall act by a qualified majority after consulting the High Representative. Only members of the Council representing the participating Member States shall take part in the vote.</p><p>A qualified majority shall be defined in accordance with Article 238(3)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</p><p>4. If a participating Member State no longer fulfils the criteria or is no longer able to meet the commitments referred to in Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on permanent structured cooperation, the Council may adopt a decision suspending the participation of the Member State concerned.</p><p>The Council shall act by a qualified majority. Only members of the Council representing the participating Member States, with the exception of the Member State in question, shall take part in the vote.</p><p>A qualified majority shall be defined in accordance with Article 238(3)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</p><p>5. Any participating Member State which wishes to withdraw from permanent structured cooperation shall notify its intention to the Council, which shall take note that the Member State in question has ceased to participate.</p><p>6. The decisions and recommendations of the Council within the framework of permanent structured cooperation, other than those provided for in paragraphs 2 to 5, shall be adopted by unanimity. For the purposes of this paragraph, unanimity shall be constituted by the votes of the representatives of the participating Member States only.</p><p>PROTOCOL<br>ON PERMANENT STRUCTURED COOPERATION</p><p>ESTABLISHED BY ARTICLE 42 OF THE TREATY ON EUROPEAN UNION</p><p>THE HIGH CONTRACTING PARTIES,</p><p>HAVING REGARD TO Article 42(6) and Article 46 of the Treaty on European Union,</p><p>RECALLING that the Union is pursuing a common foreign and security policy based on the achievement of growing convergence of action by Member States;</p><p>RECALLING that the common
