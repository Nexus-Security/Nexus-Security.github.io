A prime example involved shifting the position of a landing page form from its conventional right-side placement to the center.</p><p>(Before on the left, after on the right. Images/colors removed to protect client.)</p><div style=text-align:center><img class=lazy-hidden decoding=async src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nexusdecode/images-549143589519/main/1722560807802.png alt="Landing Page AB Test" width=680 height=183><noscript><img decoding=async src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nexusdecode/images-549143589519/main/1722560807802.png alt="Landing Page AB Test" width=680 height=183></noscript></div><p>Our baseline landing page was already well-optimized, boasting an 11% conversion rate. <strong>By simply relocating the form to a central position, we achieved a near 50% increase in conversions</strong>, reaching just shy of 16%. This demonstrates that challenging norms can yield impressive outcomes!</p><p><a class=link href=http://twitter.com/bigalittlea target=_blank rel=noopener><em>Aaron Levy</em></a> <em>has been immersed in the world of digital marketing since 2007, dedicating his time as a PPC account manager at SEER Interactive, a Philadelphia-based Search agency. In his spare time, he aspires to be a brewer/cyclist/hockey star and shares his experiences on Twitter.</em></p><h2 id=minor-ab-tests-can-yield-significant-results>Minor A/B Tests Can Yield Significant Results</h2><p>In 2007, while experimenting with URL capitalization in Google Ads, I stumbled upon a surprising 53% increase in click-through rates.</p><p>The test was straightforward. Two ads were created, identical except for the URL. One used the standard &ldquo;<a class=link href=https://www.sitename.com target=_blank rel=noopener>www.sitename.com</a>,&rdquo; while the other employed initial capitalization: &ldquo;<a class=link href=https://www.SiteName.com target=_blank rel=noopener>www.SiteName.com</a>.&rdquo; This test, replicated multiple times, consistently yielded positive results.</p><p>Although Google discontinued this URL display format, it reinforced the notion that seemingly insignificant alterations can have a considerable impact. This experience ignited my fascination with how users visually engage with search results.</p><p><em>AJ Kohn leads Blind Five Year Old, a San Francisco-based Internet marketing company specializing in search.

It lacked visual appeal, and converting required navigating to a separate, equally unimpressive form page. I strongly advised them to revamp the page, at the very least integrating a streamlined form. The revised page, while still aesthetically lacking, incorporated the pre-existing form directly.</p><p><strong>Surprisingly, this new iteration resulted in a 76% increase in website profit.</strong></p><p>This experience was a revelation for my inner perfectionist: Achieving the best possible outcome doesn&rsquo;t necessitate absolute perfection. Even incremental improvements can have a substantial impact.</p><p><em>Brad Geddes is the driving force behind</em> <a class=link href=http://certifiedknowledge.org/ target=_blank rel=noopener><em>Certified Knowledge</em></a><em>, a platform dedicated to PPC training and tools.

A recent example involved A/B testing these calls to action:</p><p>A. Get $10 off the first purchase. Book online now!
B. Get an additional $10 off. Book online now.</p><p><strong>Surprisingly, option B achieved double the click-through rate.</strong> (For the record, I had anticipated option A to be the winner.)</p><p><em>Brad Shorr leads Content & Social Media at</em> <em>Straight North</em>_, a Chicago-based full-service Internet marketing firm. He is a regular contributor on topics related to SEO, copywriting, and content marketing.

The control page presented the product and &ldquo;add to cart&rdquo; options directly. In contrast, the variation positioned the product but required an extra click to access the actual product page.</p><p><strong>Despite the additional step and lengthier text, the variation significantly outperformed the more direct approach</strong>, demonstrating a stronger conversion rate (+18% with 95% statistical significance) and a higher average order value. This highlighted the stage at which we were engaging traffic within the buying process. Consequently, we applied these findings to enhance the positioning of other products pre-sale.</p><p><em>Chris Kostecki&rsquo;s journey in Search began in 2006, complementing his marketing experience that dates back to 1997.

We sought to leverage the credibility associated with such exposure. Initially, we A/B tested an ad within our Branded Campaigns. One variation highlighted the GMA feature with a &ldquo;Featured on Good Morning America&rdquo; tagline, while the control used our standard &ldquo;Official Site&rdquo; tagline. As anticipated, the GMA tagline ads significantly outperformed the control in terms of click-through and conversion rates. This was in line with our expectations, given GMA&rsquo;s reputation.</p><p>Building on this, we implemented similar A/B ad tests across our Non-Branded campaigns. Again, the &ldquo;Featured on GMA&rdquo; variations consistently emerged victorious, which wasn&rsquo;t entirely surprising.</p><p>However, here&rsquo;s where the surprise lies. Despite the GMA segment airing nearly three years prior, even after numerous rounds of A/B testing, ad variations incorporating &ldquo;Featured on GMA&rdquo; continue to be top performers.

We took the offer/call to action that resided at the end of the sales copy and replicated it above the fold, just beneath the introductory paragraph. <strong>This minor change led to an astounding 400% increase in conversion rates.</strong> The rationale was to interrupt the user&rsquo;s flow early on, especially since the page featured extensive copy optimized for organic traffic, providing an immediate opportunity to convert.</p><p>Prior to implementing this change, I was skeptical, believing it contradicted best practices for a quality organic landing page experience.

There are simply too many noteworthy examples to choose from. So, indulge me as I share three, particularly those that evoked a &ldquo;No way, that can&rsquo;t be right, we need to extend this test&rdquo; reaction. So, without further ado, here they are:</p><ol><li><p><strong>EXTRA STRENGTH SEO CONTENT A/B TEST:</strong> As an SEO enthusiast, I tend to pack our web pages with valuable information. Why be concise when you can elaborate, right? Take our free AdWords Grader application, for instance. Scroll down, and you&rsquo;ll find a wealth of content beneath the sign-up form. However, some of my colleagues at nexus-security, with their keen eye for design and user experience, found my content-heavy approach rather unconventional. So, we decided to test removing the extensive FAQ section below the fold to gauge its impact on sign-up conversions. To our utter astonishment, the variation with the 2000-word FAQ outperformed the streamlined version. We were completely floored!</p></li><li><p><strong>EXTRA SECURE LOGIN AB TEST:</strong> Speaking of the AdWords Grader, its functionality hinges on users logging into their Google Ads accounts, allowing us to analyze performance and generate a report card highlighting strengths and areas for improvement. We had recently implemented an upgraded login mechanism using Google&rsquo;s latest OAUTH extra-secure authentication method, anticipating an increase in graded accounts. However, the A/B test yielded disappointing results. The new, highly secure OAUTH-based authentication performed poorly, likely due to the added steps in the sign-up process. Ultimately, we reverted to the standard secure Google Ads login.</p></li><li><p><strong>PRODUCT TRIAL LENGTH AB TEST:</strong> My company offers PPC management software with a free 7-day trial. We received feedback that this trial period wasn&rsquo;t sufficient for thorough testing. In response, we experimented with extending the trial to 14 days, 30 days, and so on. Measuring prospect connect rates – the percentage of qualified leads resulting in scheduled demos – we discovered a decline as the trial length increased. We ultimately reverted to the original 7-day trial. It&rsquo;s possible that the extended trials felt overwhelming to potential users.</p></li></ol><p>It&rsquo;s crucial to remember that these are just our experiences, and what worked for us might not necessarily translate to your business. The key takeaway is to remain receptive and let data guide your decisions rather than relying on self-proclaimed experts (or even customer feedback) that advocate for a specific approach.</p><p><em>Larry Kim is the Founder and CTO of</em> <em>nexus-security</em>_, Inc., the company behind the_ <em>20 Minute PPC Work Week</em> <em>and</em> <em>nexus-security Advisor</em>_, an award-winning_ <em>PPC management</em> <em>platform.

One set featured a gray button, while the other showcased a vibrant green. We rotated these ads evenly over two weeks and were thrilled with the outcome. <strong>The green button ads achieved three times the conversion rate</strong> of the gray button ads. Moreover, the green button ads significantly outperformed their gray counterparts in terms of click-through rates.</p><p>The green color choice clearly made the ads stand out, effectively recapturing the attention of shoppers who had previously abandoned their carts.

Surprisingly, the page with benefit-driven copy was outperformed by one emphasizing product features. My experience had consistently shown that benefits resonate more strongly than features. As marketers, we&rsquo;re taught to prioritize benefit-focused messaging. Yet, in this particular campaign, visitors were more interested in understanding the product&rsquo;s features. This underscores the importance of considering the target audience, traffic source, ad message, and product when determining the most effective messaging. <strong>Focusing on features rather than benefits might be the winning strategy in certain cases.</strong> However, this can only be determined through testing. (As a follow-up, we tested features versus a combined benefits/features approach, and the latter emerged victorious.

A shift in marketing regulations for one of my lead generation clients made using the word &ldquo;Apply&rdquo; in ad copy non-compliant, as customers weren&rsquo;t technically applying at that stage. After struggling to find a suitable replacement for &ldquo;Apply&rdquo; that yielded comparable results, I decided to get creative and coined the term &ldquo;PreApply.&rdquo; And yes, I maintained that capitalization. To my astonishment, this fabricated word resulted in a 27% increase in click-through rate, an 11% rise in conversion rate, and an 8% decrease in cost per acquisition.</p><p>While the reason behind its success remains unclear, perhaps suggesting a less daunting initial step, the outcome was undeniable.

We believed that incorporating additional trust symbols would enhance the credibility of their relatively new and unknown offering, potentially boosting conversions.</p><div style=text-align:center><img class=lazy-hidden decoding=async src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nexusdecode/images-549143589519/main/1722560813306.png alt="A/B test wireframe" width=378 height=954><noscript><img decoding=async src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nexusdecode/images-549143589519/main/1722560813306.png alt="A/B test wireframe" width=378 height=954></noscript></div><p>Variation A introduced these extra trust symbols above the fold, replacing the existing &ldquo;hero shot&rdquo; which seemed ineffective.</p><p>Surprisingly,** Variation A performed slightly worse** than the original landing page.</p><p>Undeterred, we created Variation B, retaining the hero shot above the fold and instead integrating the new trust icons into an expanded trust section below the form. We also reorganized the icons, giving more prominence to the newly added, more impactful symbols.</p><p>Variation B, which simply incorporated a few new icons into an existing section, <strong>achieved a staggering 367% improvement!</strong> This unexpected outcome, coupled with the marginal underperformance of the more substantial Variation A, highlighted the profound impact that subtle adjustments can have.</p><p><a class=link href=http://www.tomdemers.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener><em>Tom Demers</em></a> <em>is the co-founder and managing partner of</em> <em>Measured SEM search engine marketing consulting</em>_, a boutique search marketing firm. <em>To connect with Tom directly, reach out via email at tom at measuredsem.com or through</em> <a class=link href=http://twitter.com/tomdemers target=_blank rel=noopener><em>following him on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2 id=your-turn-whats-your-most-surprising-ab-test>Your Turn: What’s your most surprising A/B test?</h2><p>What are your thoughts on these A/B testing experiences?
