With the necessary Treaty modifications in the Lisbon Treaty and a negotiated accession treaty by 2013, it appeared that the CJEU&amp;rsquo;s December 2014 ruling would solidify this union. However, the Court&amp;rsquo;s judgment (Opinion 2/13), which was subject to criticism on this blog, unexpectedly disrupted the accession process.

The initial Common European Asylum System (CEAS) legislation defined &amp;lsquo;subsidiary protection,&amp;rsquo; which protects individuals ineligible for refugee status but shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be returned to their home country. However, other initial CEAS legislation, particularly the asylum procedures Directive, didn&amp;rsquo;t cover those seeking subsidiary protection or clarify the connection between refugee and subsidiary protection statuses.
This gap has been addressed in several ways. Firstly, future second-phase CEAS legislation fully applies to subsidiary protection applicants and defines the relationship between refugee and subsidiary protection statuses...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/rights-to-due-process-and-secondary-protection/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/rights-to-due-process-and-secondary-protection/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Prototype, prototype, chains of inheritance, constructors..</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/prototype-prototype-chains-of-inheritance-constructors../</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 14:13:03 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/prototype-prototype-chains-of-inheritance-constructors../</guid><description>The &amp;ldquo;JS101&amp;rdquo; section in dailyjs is always a valuable read.

The Great Repeal Bill is ironically named because it won&amp;rsquo;t actually repeal much EU law. Instead, when Brexit concludes, it will initially shift existing EU law into British law.

Introduction
The Treaty of Lisbon introduced Article 50 to the Treaty on European Union (TEU), establishing the legal framework for exiting the European Union (EU). This article acknowledges the possibility of withdrawal, a concept many legal experts believed existed even before the Treaty of Lisbon. Article 50 TEU outlines the withdrawal procedure. However, some argue that it contradicts the EU&amp;rsquo;s fundamental nature and weakens member states&amp;rsquo; commitment to European integration, raising questions about the ideal withdrawal mechanism...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-article-50-of-the-treaty-on-european-union-considered-valid/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-article-50-of-the-treaty-on-european-union-considered-valid/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Google Mobile Benchmarks – Categorized by Ad Type!

Such a suspension would provide any Schengen country the option to reinstate or implement border controls along their shared internal borders.

Germany&amp;rsquo;s recent exploration of expelling unemployed EU citizens has sparked interest among critics of EU free movement in the UK. As this topic gains traction, it&amp;rsquo;s timely to clarify the circumstances under which EU citizens can be expelled.

You might not get a CD-ROM drive, probably won&amp;rsquo;t get a floppy disc drive, and may never use the phone modem jack again...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-is-ethernet-wan/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-is-ethernet-wan/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The Absent Piece on Qt Multithreading in C++</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-absent-piece-on-qt-multithreading-in-c-/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-absent-piece-on-qt-multithreading-in-c-/</guid><description>C++ programmers aim to create strong multithreaded applications with Qt, but multithreading is tricky due to race conditions, synchronization issues, deadlocks, and livelocks.

A previous post documented the initial assessment of the unit.
Upon beginning the restoration, the turntable was in relatively original condition. However, the platter motor showed signs of prior work, evidenced by an incorrectly installed pulley.
To address this, the motor was removed and disassembled to extract and lubricate the bearings. This involved immersing them in motor oil under vacuum until air bubbles ceased to appear, indicating the bearings were properly saturated...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-full-functional-restoration/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-full-functional-restoration/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Council v H: Another Court victory in the Common Foreign and Security Policy</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/council-v-h-another-court-victory-in-the-common-foreign-and-security-policy/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Feb 2024 01:29:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/council-v-h-another-court-victory-in-the-common-foreign-and-security-policy/</guid><description>Graham Butler, PhD Fellow at the Centre for Comparative and European Constitutional Studies, Faculty of Law, University of Copenhagen, Denmark

Despite the Treaty of Lisbon&amp;rsquo;s integration of this largely intergovernmental area (previously the Second Pillar) into the unified ‘EU’, its legacy persists. Enduring evidence of CFSP as a distinct yet incorporated legal domain allows it to be termed ‘CFSP law’...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/council-v-h-another-court-victory-in-the-common-foreign-and-security-policy/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/council-v-h-another-court-victory-in-the-common-foreign-and-security-policy/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Singaporeans will receive increased support for SkillsFuture</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/singaporeans-will-receive-increased-support-for-skillsfuture/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Feb 2024 00:48:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/singaporeans-will-receive-increased-support-for-skillsfuture/</guid><description>Source: SkillsFuture Singapore.

Your trusty T1 line has served you well for years, maybe even decades. You appreciate its reliability, consistent bandwidth, minimal lag, and decreasing contract prices. However, the bandwidth is becoming a constraint. While 1.5 Mbps was sufficient a decade ago, it&amp;rsquo;s no longer enough. Can you maintain T1&amp;rsquo;s performance with faster speeds? Absolutely!
