The initial Common European Asylum System (CEAS) legislation defined &amp;lsquo;subsidiary protection,&amp;rsquo; which protects individuals ineligible for refugee status but shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be returned to their home country. However, other initial CEAS legislation, particularly the asylum procedures Directive, didn&amp;rsquo;t cover those seeking subsidiary protection or clarify the connection between refugee and subsidiary protection statuses.
This gap has been addressed in several ways. Firstly, future second-phase CEAS legislation fully applies to subsidiary protection applicants and defines the relationship between refugee and subsidiary protection statuses...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/rights-to-due-process-and-secondary-protection/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/rights-to-due-process-and-secondary-protection/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Prototype, prototype, chains of inheritance, constructors..</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/prototype-prototype-chains-of-inheritance-constructors../</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 14:13:03 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/prototype-prototype-chains-of-inheritance-constructors../</guid><description>The &amp;ldquo;JS101&amp;rdquo; section in dailyjs is always a valuable read.

As an EU law and human rights professor for over two decades, the topic of sanctioning Member States for human rights violations was once straightforward. The enforcement procedure (Article 7 TEU) was never used, making in-depth discussions unnecessary. My focus remained on practical issues like arrest warrants and asylum seekers.
However, the landscape has shifted. Like Article 50, which also addresses the EU&amp;rsquo;s relationship with Member States, Article 7 seems hastily drafted without considering its practical application, possibly because its creators never anticipated its use...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/part-1-the-legal-framework-should-the-eu-impose-sanctions-on-its-member-states-for-violations-of-the-rule-of-law-and-human-rights/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/part-1-the-legal-framework-should-the-eu-impose-sanctions-on-its-member-states-for-violations-of-the-rule-of-law-and-human-rights/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Join us at Smile Singapore in Clarke Quay Central and share your beautiful smile with us!</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/join-us-at-smile-singapore-in-clarke-quay-central-and-share-your-beautiful-smile-with-us/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2024 23:50:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/join-us-at-smile-singapore-in-clarke-quay-central-and-share-your-beautiful-smile-with-us/</guid><description>The installation of the Smile project at Clarke Quay Central is currently underway.

The Great Repeal Bill is ironically named because it won&amp;rsquo;t actually repeal much EU law. Instead, when Brexit concludes, it will initially shift existing EU law into British law. While this maintains some stability during the transition, the bill also includes a concerning element: a Henry VIII clause.

The Treaty of Lisbon introduced Article 50 to the Treaty on European Union (TEU), establishing the legal framework for exiting the European Union (EU). This article acknowledges the possibility of withdrawal, a concept many legal experts believed existed even before the Treaty of Lisbon. Article 50 TEU outlines the withdrawal procedure. However, some argue that it contradicts the EU&amp;rsquo;s fundamental nature and weakens member states&amp;rsquo; commitment to European integration, raising questions about the ideal withdrawal mechanism...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-article-50-of-the-treaty-on-european-union-considered-valid/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-article-50-of-the-treaty-on-european-union-considered-valid/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The CJEU revives the old 'third pillar' with the EU Zombie Law.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-revives-the-old-third-pillar-with-the-eu-zombie-law./</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 18:24:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-revives-the-old-third-pillar-with-the-eu-zombie-law./</guid><description>Steve Peers

The European Commission&amp;rsquo;s proposal for an AI Liability Directive, published on September 28, 2022, alongside an updated Product Liability Directive, aims to address the risks posed by artificial intelligence (AI) while acknowledging its potential benefits.

Victims of crime are often disheartened not just by the crime itself but also by the criminal justice system&amp;rsquo;s indifference to their needs. To tackle this issue, the EU introduced a Directive on crime victims’ rights in 2012 that Member States were required to implement by November 16, 2015.

A fundamental principle within EU law concerning the freedom of movement posits that it primarily pertains to EU citizens residing in a Member State different from their home country. Consequently, EU citizens residing in their own Member State cannot generally invoke this law. However, ECJ case law sometimes permits them to assert rights based on their EU citizenship.

This proposal stems from what are being termed &amp;ldquo;systemic deficiencies&amp;rdquo; in Greece&amp;rsquo;s management of its external borders, particularly concerning the influx of refugees and migrants. Such a suspension would provide any Schengen country the option to reinstate or implement border controls along their shared internal borders. While it&amp;rsquo;s unlikely that every Schengen country would exercise this option, it&amp;rsquo;s anticipated that several would choose to do so, especially given that a number already have active border controls in place...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-possible-to-suspend-schengen-due-to-greece-is-it-necessary-to-do-so/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-possible-to-suspend-schengen-due-to-greece-is-it-necessary-to-do-so/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Are Your T1 Lines Saturated?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/are-your-t1-lines-saturated/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jun 2024 02:36:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/are-your-t1-lines-saturated/</guid><description>By: John Shepler
The perfect network connection is invisible.

It is a fundamental principle of EU law, as taught to every student of the subject, that the Commission has a near-monopoly on proposing new EU legislation - it is the &amp;lsquo;motor&amp;rsquo; of EU integration. This near-monopoly is often called the Commission&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;right of initiative&amp;rsquo;. But does this right also imply a right to withdraw proposals? And if it does, are there any limitations to this power?

This tactic has been used against both recent research on the positive impacts of free movement of EU citizens and me personally.

While the report attempts to offer a thorough analysis, it highlights the poor quality of the overall Brexit debate.

High-performance Wide Area Network (WAN) bandwidth is necessary for connectivity, regardless of whether your data center is on-premises or cloud-based. Let&amp;rsquo;s explore the available choices.
On-Premises Infrastructure
A significant advantage of managing your servers and data center equipment in-house is having control over the on-site network. Your Local Area Network (LAN) likely operates at a minimum speed of 100 to 1000 Mbps. Within the data center, connections might have even higher speeds to facilitate short-distance connections between storage, processing, security devices, and other components...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/bandwidth-for-cloud-and-on-premises/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/bandwidth-for-cloud-and-on-premises/</a></p></description></item><item><title>A new e-trading platform for physical commodities, based on blockchain technology, has been launched in Singapore on a global scale</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-new-e-trading-platform-for-physical-commodities-based-on-blockchain-technology-has-been-launched-in-singapore-on-a-global-scale/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Apr 2024 20:38:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-new-e-trading-platform-for-physical-commodities-based-on-blockchain-technology-has-been-launched-in-singapore-on-a-global-scale/</guid><description>The Commodities Intelligence Centre (CIC) has introduced Singapore&amp;rsquo;s first physical commodity business-to-business (B2B) e-trading platform in collaboration with key partners: Zall Smartcomm, a prominent B2B player in China; Global eTrade Services (GeTS) Asia, a subsidiary of CrimsonLogic; and Singapore Exchange (SGX).

This case, concerning two Iraqi sisters seeking asylum in the Netherlands, centers around interpreting &amp;ldquo;membership of a particular social group&amp;rdquo; within the EU&amp;rsquo;s Qualification Directive, specifically regarding &amp;ldquo;westernized women&amp;rdquo; who fear persecution upon returning to their home countries...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/advancing-gender-sensitive-eu-asylum-law-examining-the-situation-of-westernised-women/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/advancing-gender-sensitive-eu-asylum-law-examining-the-situation-of-westernised-women/</a></p></description></item><item><title>When It Comes to Computer Networks, Trust No One and No Thing</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/when-it-comes-to-computer-networks-trust-no-one-and-no-thing/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 13:03:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/when-it-comes-to-computer-networks-trust-no-one-and-no-thing/</guid><description>By: John Shepler
Network security is a major concern for businesses today. One might even miss the days of isolated computers, unconnected to any network.
However, even those isolated computers weren&amp;rsquo;t entirely secure. Malware could still spread and confidential files could be copied through physical transfer of files using floppy disks. The challenge today is that modern networks, encompassing local networks, data centers, multiple cloud platforms, and the internet, make it incredibly difficult to track who is accessing the network and their intentions...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/when-it-comes-to-computer-networks-trust-no-one-and-no-thing/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/when-it-comes-to-computer-networks-trust-no-one-and-no-thing/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Finally achieving greater coherence for the Ne Bis in Idem Principle: Analysis of the Bpost Judgment (C-117/20)</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/finally-achieving-greater-coherence-for-the-ne-bis-in-idem-principle-analysis-of-the-bpost-judgment-c-117/20/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 01:55:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/finally-achieving-greater-coherence-for-the-ne-bis-in-idem-principle-analysis-of-the-bpost-judgment-c-117/20/</guid><description>Towards Greater Coherence on Ne Bis in Idem: The bpost Case Victor Davio and Ilaria Gambardella*

The EU legal system is often viewed as a distinct entity, separate from both international and national law. Within this system, safeguarding fundamental rights is paramount. Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) establishes a three-pronged approach to fundamental rights protection: 1) the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, 2) the EU&amp;rsquo;s commitment to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), and 3) general principles of EU law derived from the ECHR and shared constitutional values of member states...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/unexpected-turn-of-events-case-c-128/18-dorobantu-the-conditions-of-detention-and-the-echrs-relevance-in-the-eu-legal-system/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/unexpected-turn-of-events-case-c-128/18-dorobantu-the-conditions-of-detention-and-the-echrs-relevance-in-the-eu-legal-system/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Guests are now welcomed at The Murray, Hong Kong</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/guests-are-now-welcomed-at-the-murray-hong-kong/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Apr 2024 20:26:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/guests-are-now-welcomed-at-the-murray-hong-kong/</guid><description>Source: Wharf Hotels.

The COVID-19 pandemic has taken center stage, demanding an urgent worldwide response that is yet to materialize. In light of this global crisis, the issue of Brexit, particularly its self-serving nature and political maneuvering, has understandably faded from the minds of both policymakers and the public. However, despite the pandemic&amp;rsquo;s onset in mid-March 2020, which coincided with the start of negotiations for a new EU-UK partnership and led to widespread lockdowns across Europe, the UK government remains steadfast in its refusal to extend the post-Brexit transition period beyond the December 31, 2020, deadline established in the October 2019 EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/brexit-and-labour-standards-during-covid-19-will-they-align-or-separate/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/brexit-and-labour-standards-during-covid-19-will-they-align-or-separate/</a></p></description></item><item><title>SIP Trunks vs ISDN PRI</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/sip-trunks-vs-isdn-pri/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Mar 2024 21:52:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/sip-trunks-vs-isdn-pri/</guid><description>Businesses have moved past analog phone lines, embracing PBX systems and ISDN PRI for their communication needs.

A previous post documented the initial assessment of the unit.
Upon beginning the restoration, the turntable was in relatively original condition. However, the platter motor showed signs of prior work, evidenced by an incorrectly installed pulley.
To address this, the motor was removed and disassembled to extract and lubricate the bearings. This involved immersing them in motor oil under vacuum until air bubbles ceased to appear, indicating the bearings were properly saturated...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-full-functional-restoration/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-full-functional-restoration/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Council v H: Another Court victory in the Common Foreign and Security Policy</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/council-v-h-another-court-victory-in-the-common-foreign-and-security-policy/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Feb 2024 01:29:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/council-v-h-another-court-victory-in-the-common-foreign-and-security-policy/</guid><description>Graham Butler, PhD Fellow at the Centre for Comparative and European Constitutional Studies, Faculty of Law, University of Copenhagen, Denmark

The recent judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in the case of DK (C-653/19 PPU, 28 November 2019) has validated two concerning observations about the state of European criminal law. Firstly, Directive 2016/343 on the presumption of innocence has limited practical application, particularly regarding pre-trial detention. Secondly, pre-trial detention is a contentious subject, with both the CJEU and the EU legislator hesitant to establish common standards despite their absence negatively impacting mutual trust between Member States&amp;rsquo; judicial systems...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/pilate-cleanses-his-hands.-the-cjeus-stance-on-pre-trial-detention./">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/pilate-cleanses-his-hands.-the-cjeus-stance-on-pre-trial-detention./</a></p></description></item><item><title>Configuring and Protecting a Cloud Server</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/configuring-and-protecting-a-cloud-server/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Feb 2024 02:11:38 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/configuring-and-protecting-a-cloud-server/</guid><description>Let&amp;rsquo;s explore the concept of a cloud server.

Determining the employment rights of undocumented migrants is complex. On one hand, granting them full access to employment law protections could incentivize unauthorized migration. On the other hand, applying standard employment laws to all workers, regardless of immigration status, could prevent the exploitation of undocumented migrants and deter employers from hiring them to save money.
The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) addressed this issue in the Tumer case, which focused on the application of the EU Directive on insolvent employers to undocumented migrants...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/eu-employment-law-and-irregular-migrants/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/eu-employment-law-and-irregular-migrants/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Cloud Hosting Providers For Converged Networks</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/cloud-hosting-providers-for-converged-networks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Feb 2024 19:40:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/cloud-hosting-providers-for-converged-networks/</guid><description>The use of cloud computing services is rapidly increasing.

Background
The Bărbulescu case examined the permissible extent of employer monitoring of employee communications, including internet usage, particularly when private conversations might be mixed with work-related ones. An employee, dismissed for violating a company policy prohibiting personal use of work equipment, sued his employer in Romania. He lost and appealed under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which protects privacy rights, arguing that his employer&amp;rsquo;s monitoring of his communications violated the precedent set by Copland v UK...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/workplace-privacy-the-strasbourg-grand-chamber-provides-clarity-on-legal-standards/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/workplace-privacy-the-strasbourg-grand-chamber-provides-clarity-on-legal-standards/</a></p></description></item><item><title>StarHub introduces WeChat SIM card for tourists from China visiting Singapore</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/starhub-introduces-wechat-sim-card-for-tourists-from-china-visiting-singapore/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Feb 2024 08:37:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/starhub-introduces-wechat-sim-card-for-tourists-from-china-visiting-singapore/</guid><description>StarHub has introduced two new prepaid SIM cards, named &amp;ldquo;StarHub WeChat Go SIM&amp;rdquo;, specifically designed for Chinese tourists visiting Singapore.

Advocate General (‘AG’) Szpunar&amp;rsquo;s November 25, 2021, opinion regarding a legal challenge from the European Commission against the European Council (Case C-161/20) highlights the contrasting interests between the European Union (‘EU’) and its Member States. This disagreement centers around how they exercise their authority within the International Maritime Organization (‘IMO’), an organization where the EU currently holds neither membership nor observer status. If the Court of Justice sides with AG Szpunar&amp;rsquo;s analysis, this case could significantly impact how the EU interest is represented within IMO committees, potentially shifting power from the Commission to the Member States...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-labeling-of-the-european-union-in-the-international-maritime-organization-is-more-of-a-focus-than-the-eus-actual-competence./">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-labeling-of-the-european-union-in-the-international-maritime-organization-is-more-of-a-focus-than-the-eus-actual-competence./</a></p></description></item><item><title>Permissions for the Forecaster Database Transfer Tool</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/permissions-for-the-forecaster-database-transfer-tool/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jan 2024 23:49:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/permissions-for-the-forecaster-database-transfer-tool/</guid><description>Special thanks to Jake Friedl from Microsoft for his guidance on this issue.

When choosing business internet services, bandwidth is important, but understanding the difference between dedicated and shared connections is crucial.
What Does Dedicated Mean?
Dedicated bandwidth is exclusively for your use. This might seem obvious, but the recent rise of shared bandwidth makes it worth clarifying. The cost-effectiveness of shared bandwidth often makes businesses reconsider their need for a dedicated line.
Cost Considerations
Shared bandwidth is significantly cheaper than dedicated bandwidth at similar speeds...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/dedicated-vs-shared-internet/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/dedicated-vs-shared-internet/</a></p></description></item><item><title>I provide my customers with access to my source code.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/i-provide-my-customers-with-access-to-my-source-code./</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jan 2024 03:39:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/i-provide-my-customers-with-access-to-my-source-code./</guid><description>This blog has a new home!

Recent discussions about the UK&amp;rsquo;s post-Brexit return to blue passports have been marked by misinformation.

Additionally, the EU never mandated the burgundy color; it was merely a non-binding suggestion.

Experts in EU law see Treaty amendments as a monumental event. After the Treaty of Lisbon, significant changes to the Treaty seemed improbable in the near future. However, this prospect is becoming more likely due to David Cameron&amp;rsquo;s push to renegotiate free movement regulations within the EU, a sentiment somewhat shared by the UK Labour party.

A couple of weeks ago, a portion of the world experienced a communication blackout. This disruption wasn&amp;rsquo;t caused by governments or hackers, but by a powerful typhoon named Haiyan, which devastated the Philippines, resulting in thousands of casualties, millions displaced, and communication infrastructure crippled.
Natural disasters often obliterate infrastructure, including buildings, roads, radio towers, power lines, and telephone wires.

After the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) invalidated the EU&amp;rsquo;s data retention Directive, a crucial question emerged: do those same rules affect national data retention laws? This post will explain why that&amp;rsquo;s the case.
We begin with Article 51 of the EU&amp;rsquo;s Charter of Fundamental Rights.

While it&amp;rsquo;s unlikely to grab sensationalist headlines, a recent Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruling on social security rules for Swiss citizens raises important questions about extending such rules to non-EU countries and the EU&amp;rsquo;s relationship with Switzerland.

The EU has been working for many years to attract highly skilled individuals from non-EU countries. However, the European Commission&amp;rsquo;s reports indicate that the existing legislation, specifically the 2005 Researchers&amp;rsquo; Directive and the 2004 Students&amp;rsquo; Directive, have not significantly increased the number of students and researchers coming to the EU.

Parental child abduction is a serious issue, often arising from custody disputes during family law proceedings. While abduction by a stranger presents a clear danger, abduction by a non-custodial parent violates court decisions and can hinder the custodial parent&amp;rsquo;s rights, especially when the child is taken to another country.
The Hague Convention, established in 1980, seeks to address this problem.

This sentiment has fueled a significant reformation of EU banking regulations, including transferring banking supervision to the European Central Bank, establishing new rules for bank bailouts, and creating provisions for criminal penalties against bankers engaged in market abuse...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-eu-going-too-far-by-capping-bankers-bonuses/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-eu-going-too-far-by-capping-bankers-bonuses/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Numerous methods to ignite internal innovation at TRA</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/numerous-methods-to-ignite-internal-innovation-at-tra/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Dec 2023 06:35:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/numerous-methods-to-ignite-internal-innovation-at-tra/</guid><description>Source: TRA.

Not long ago, the idea of businesses and government agencies needing 100 Gbps WAN bandwidth seemed outlandish. Providers primarily used 10 Gbps networks, occasionally upgrading to 40 Gbps to accommodate high traffic from multiple customers. Today, those same customers seek 40 Gbps and even 100 Gbps connectivity options from their providers.
The driving force behind this surge in bandwidth demand is &amp;ldquo;Big Data.&amp;rdquo; Big Data presents significant potential for enhancing business operations and data analysis, but it demands substantial processing power, storage capacity, and bandwidth...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/big-data-makes-big-push-for-100-gigabit-bandwidth/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/big-data-makes-big-push-for-100-gigabit-bandwidth/</a></p></description></item><item><title>What is the appropriate response from the EU to the unlawful blocking of the Lachin corridor?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-is-the-appropriate-response-from-the-eu-to-the-unlawful-blocking-of-the-lachin-corridor/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Nov 2023 04:20:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-is-the-appropriate-response-from-the-eu-to-the-unlawful-blocking-of-the-lachin-corridor/</guid><description>Nariné Ghazaryan, Assistant Professor in International and European Law, Radboud University Nijmegen

The 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war ceasefire agreement, brokered by Russia, was seen with skepticism by close observers of the region. By mid-2021, attacks on Armenian territory made it evident that the ceasefire was unstable. This prompted the EU to take a leading role in peace negotiations between Armenia and Azerbaijan. This leadership involved high-profile mediation by European Council President Charles Michel, focusing on prisoner exchanges, discreet diplomatic initiatives, and a series of high-level trilateral meetings throughout 2021 and 2022...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-is-the-appropriate-response-from-the-eu-to-the-unlawful-blocking-of-the-lachin-corridor/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-is-the-appropriate-response-from-the-eu-to-the-unlawful-blocking-of-the-lachin-corridor/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Three main points about the EU's New Pact on Migration and Asylum</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/three-main-points-about-the-eus-new-pact-on-migration-and-asylum/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Nov 2023 03:25:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/three-main-points-about-the-eus-new-pact-on-migration-and-asylum/</guid><description>Lilian Tsourdi, Assistant Professor, University of Maastricht

The EU&amp;rsquo;s New Pact on Migration and Asylum, along with its accompanying legislative proposals, represents the latest policy framework for asylum, migration, and border management. Its stated goal is to create streamlined migration procedures and stronger governance. Since September 2020, negotiations on the Pact&amp;rsquo;s legislative components have been underway.
Recently, both the European Parliament (April 2023) and the Council of the European Union (June 2023) have adopted negotiating positions on two significant instruments: the Asylum Procedures Regulation (APR), which updates regulations on determining asylum and related rights, and the Asylum and Migration Management Regulation (AMMR), which reforms the EU&amp;rsquo;s system for allocating responsibility for processing asylum requests and establishing a solidarity framework...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/three-main-points-about-the-eus-new-pact-on-migration-and-asylum/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/three-main-points-about-the-eus-new-pact-on-migration-and-asylum/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Brand Alliance reveals the top influential brands in Asia for 2015</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/brand-alliance-reveals-the-top-influential-brands-in-asia-for-2015/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Nov 2023 03:10:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/brand-alliance-reveals-the-top-influential-brands-in-asia-for-2015/</guid><description>Source: Brand Alliance.

Introduction
The principle of non-refoulement, which forbids returning individuals to unsafe nations, is generally considered absolute. However, ambiguity persists concerning its application within the EU&amp;rsquo;s Qualification Directive, which governs the determination of refugee or subsidiary protection status. The Czech Nejvyšší správní soud inquired with the Court of Justice of the European Union on July 14, 2016, about the potential conflict between Article 14(4) of the Qualification Directive and the principle of non-refoulement (Case C-391/16)...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-non-refoulement-principle-in-the-eus-qualification-directive-considered-invalid/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-non-refoulement-principle-in-the-eus-qualification-directive-considered-invalid/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The IDA in Singapore has compiled a report on home computer usage in Singapore for the year 2014</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-ida-in-singapore-has-compiled-a-report-on-home-computer-usage-in-singapore-for-the-year-2014/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Nov 2023 13:43:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-ida-in-singapore-has-compiled-a-report-on-home-computer-usage-in-singapore-for-the-year-2014/</guid><description>A 2014 survey by the Infocomm Development Authority (IDA) of Singapore revealed a surge in smartphone, computer, and internet use among Singaporean seniors.

The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) recently made significant rulings on data privacy. In the Digital Rights case, the court struck down the EU&amp;rsquo;s data retention directive, deeming it mass surveillance lacking adequate safeguards. They also ruled against Google in the &amp;ldquo;right to be forgotten&amp;rdquo; case. These decisions have prompted questions about their broader implications. For instance, an Irish court has referred the &amp;ldquo;Europe v Facebook&amp;rdquo; case to the CJEU, questioning the compatibility of the EU-US &amp;ldquo;Safe Harbour&amp;rdquo; data protection arrangement in light of the Snowden revelations...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/how-many-eu-treaties-infringe-upon-the-rights-to-privacy-and-data-protection-due-to-the-domino-effect/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/how-many-eu-treaties-infringe-upon-the-rights-to-privacy-and-data-protection-due-to-the-domino-effect/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The Tele 2 and Watson case: Human Rights and National Data Retention Law</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-tele-2-and-watson-case-human-rights-and-national-data-retention-law/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Nov 2023 23:05:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-tele-2-and-watson-case-human-rights-and-national-data-retention-law/</guid><description>Lorna Woods, Professor of Internet Law, University of Essex

Family life is essential for everyone living in the EU, regardless of their citizenship.

Introduction
After a 2001 attempt to create a comprehensive EU law regarding entry and residency for non-EU workers failed, the EU&amp;rsquo;s approach to labor migration has been fragmented and industry-specific. Due to the sensitivity surrounding immigration and the importance of national sovereignty, the EU has focused on creating laws for a select few economic migrant categories.
Highly skilled workers are one such category...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/will-the-new-blue-card-proposal-entice-a-greater-number-of-highly-skilled-workers-to-the-eu/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/will-the-new-blue-card-proposal-entice-a-greater-number-of-highly-skilled-workers-to-the-eu/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The Rohan Potato: An Incredible Tale of a Misplaced Tubercle (around 1840)</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-rohan-potato-an-incredible-tale-of-a-misplaced-tubercle-around-1840/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Oct 2023 16:26:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-rohan-potato-an-incredible-tale-of-a-misplaced-tubercle-around-1840/</guid><description>Dated August 9, 2016 AD
My fascination with the Rohan potato began when I encountered an intriguing account in my 1840 edition of Thomas’s Farmer’s Almanac.

The Rohan Potato, a recent arrival from France, boasts an exceptional characteristic: remarkable productivity. This attribute is highly valuable for farmers who primarily cultivate potatoes for livestock feed. However, its quality for human consumption isn&amp;rsquo;t as celebrated. While acknowledged for its firm texture, it&amp;rsquo;s generally considered a second or third-rate table potato among northern varieties...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-rohan-potato-an-incredible-tale-of-a-misplaced-tubercle-around-1840/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-rohan-potato-an-incredible-tale-of-a-misplaced-tubercle-around-1840/</a></p></description></item><item><title>InterContinental Hotels &amp; Resorts presents an art installation in Singapore to commemorate its 200 properties worldwide</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/intercontinental-hotels-resorts-presents-an-art-installation-in-singapore-to-commemorate-its-200-properties-worldwide/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Oct 2023 15:47:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/intercontinental-hotels-resorts-presents-an-art-installation-in-singapore-to-commemorate-its-200-properties-worldwide/</guid><description>Video of Hall with the bottles shaping the number &amp;lsquo;200&amp;rsquo;.

Have you been relying on a T1 line for a long time? It&amp;rsquo;s understandable, given their long history. When the Internet was new, a T1 line provided businesses with a dependable, high-bandwidth connection that made dial-up modems seem incredibly slow. These days, similar bandwidth options are available at comparable prices, making those old T1 lines appear slow in comparison.

Reaching the age of 18 is a major milestone, signifying a transition to adulthood. While it may not bring immediate changes to family dynamics, it holds significant legal implications.
However, in immigration and asylum law, turning 18 can mean reduced legal rights, especially for vulnerable unaccompanied minors.

A Bosnian folk song tells the story of a Pasha who died from a severe illness. When his wife heard about his passing, she died from grief. Similarly, now that the UK has chosen to leave the European Union, will the same fate befall data protection laws once the UK exits the EU?

The European Union (EU) has faced criticism for administrative and structural shortcomings, with reports and discussions pointing to political irregularities within its system.

In a previous installment of this series, we learned that Ralph Borsodi believed everyone should have the opportunity to access land. He considered private land ownership, especially by large entities and investors, to be detrimental. This viewpoint is reflected in his earlier statement about a &amp;ldquo;God-given right of access to land&amp;rdquo; as a fundamental human right...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/part-7-of-ralph-borsodis-tips-for-weathering-an-economic-crisis/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/part-7-of-ralph-borsodis-tips-for-weathering-an-economic-crisis/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Set up LAMP on Debian/Ubuntu</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/set-up-lamp-on-debian/ubuntu/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 16:18:59 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/set-up-lamp-on-debian/ubuntu/</guid><description>A LAMP stack is a collection of open-source software used to build websites and web applications.

1. Introduction
The European Commission recently released two important documents on October 17th: a progress report on the EU&amp;rsquo;s plan to combat human trafficking and a report on how a specific directive (Directive 2004/81) is being used to protect victims. This analysis will delve into the key findings of both reports and offer concluding observations.

The Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMSD) has been undergoing revisions since 2016, sparking debate about how to update it for the digital age. While the Council and European Parliament generally agree that video-sharing platforms (VSPs) need some regulation, they differ significantly on the specifics. This disagreement is evident in the ongoing trilogue negotiations, where even accessing agreed-upon positions has proven difficult due to the influence of interest groups concerned about advertising regulations...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/update-of-the-directive-on-audiovisual-media-services-platforms-for-sharing-videos/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/update-of-the-directive-on-audiovisual-media-services-platforms-for-sharing-videos/</a></p></description></item><item><title>String that is secure</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/string-that-is-secure/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Sep 2023 13:06:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/string-that-is-secure/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve previously used the SecureString class to handle passwords in memory, but I&amp;rsquo;ve realized I wasn&amp;rsquo;t using it correctly.

Clearing Sensitive Data from Memory
It&amp;rsquo;s crucial to minimize the time sensitive data resides in memory. While it&amp;rsquo;s tempting to just release the memory, the .NET garbage collection process isn&amp;rsquo;t immediate. Overwriting the memory is a better approach. However, strings in .NET are immutable, making overwriting difficult...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/string-that-is-secure/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/string-that-is-secure/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Latest CJEU judgment on family reunion, children's rights, and effective remedies.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/latest-cjeu-judgment-on-family-reunion-childrens-rights-and-effective-remedies./</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Sep 2023 07:30:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/latest-cjeu-judgment-on-family-reunion-childrens-rights-and-effective-remedies./</guid><description>Professor Steve Peers, University of Essex
For parents, raising teenagers presents a constant awareness of time&amp;rsquo;s passage. But consider parents separated from their children by the unfeeling nature of immigration policies: missing milestones, first words, and school events. Even when these parents strive to fulfill family reunion requirements, their children may age out of eligibility during the lengthy application process, leaving a profound void.

EU law can be complicated, especially when it comes to Directives. Unlike Regulations, Directives are not automatically binding between private parties. However, individuals can use Directives against the State, creating a need to define what &amp;ldquo;State&amp;rdquo; means in this context, given the variety of public-private relationships across the EU.
EU law addresses this through the concept of &amp;ldquo;emanation of the State,&amp;rdquo; which clarifies which bodies are subject to Directives...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-european-court-of-justice-clarifies-the-vertical-direct-effect-of-directives-in-cases-where-daddy-is-responsible-for-paying-for-your-crashed-car./">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-european-court-of-justice-clarifies-the-vertical-direct-effect-of-directives-in-cases-where-daddy-is-responsible-for-paying-for-your-crashed-car./</a></p></description></item><item><title>The application of the EU Charter of Rights to derogations in the internal market of Member States.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-application-of-the-eu-charter-of-rights-to-derogations-in-the-internal-market-of-member-states./</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Aug 2023 19:26:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-application-of-the-eu-charter-of-rights-to-derogations-in-the-internal-market-of-member-states./</guid><description>By Steve Peers

When I&amp;rsquo;m coding in Visual Studio and defining properties for a class, the most frequent type I use is string. This is especially true for Dynamics GP projects where over 90% of my properties are strings.
Visual Studio&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;prop&amp;rdquo; snippet helps by auto-generating most of the property declaration. However, repeatedly specifying &amp;ldquo;string&amp;rdquo; for dozens of properties gets tiresome.
Typing &amp;ldquo;prop&amp;rdquo; and hitting tab twice creates a property line (an &amp;ldquo;automatically implemented property&amp;rdquo;)...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/creating-a-visual-studio-snippet-for-a-c%23-property-with-the-public-string-access-modifier/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/creating-a-visual-studio-snippet-for-a-c%23-property-with-the-public-string-access-modifier/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Casting, transforming, and forcing data types</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/casting-transforming-and-forcing-data-types/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Aug 2023 20:17:15 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/casting-transforming-and-forcing-data-types/</guid><description>The concepts of casting, conversion, and coercion can be easily mixed up, especially when talking about them across different programming languages. C# adds to this confusion with its blend of casting and conversion. This is evident in the numerous questions on Stack Overflow [[1]], [[2]]&amp;hellip;
My understanding of this topic has evolved thanks to recent research. I previously saw casting (both upcasting and downcasting) as a way for developers to guide the compiler...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/casting-transforming-and-forcing-data-types/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/casting-transforming-and-forcing-data-types/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
