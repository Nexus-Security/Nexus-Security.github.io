>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The potential inclusion of the EU into the ECHR has been a long-awaited development. With the necessary Treaty modifications in the Lisbon Treaty and a negotiated accession treaty by 2013, it appeared that the CJEU&amp;rsquo;s December 2014 ruling would solidify this union. However, the Court&amp;rsquo;s judgment (Opinion 2/13), which was subject to criticism on this blog, unexpectedly disrupted the accession process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the process was resurrected in 2019 and has advanced quickly since then. The following two blog entries, written by Anita Kovacs and Stian Øby Johansen, respectively, provide an update and analysis of the most recent developments by providing a general description of the procedure and a more thorough examination of the problems. The observations made by Stian Øby Johansen are partially taken from entries that were previously published here and here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The EU&amp;rsquo;s accession to the ECHR: A complex history of negotiations - It&amp;rsquo;s Complicated&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Anita Kovacs&lt;/strong>, MA in EU Law, King&amp;rsquo;s College London&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For several decades, the European Union (EU)&amp;rsquo;s potential membership in the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR) has been a topic of discussion among European leaders. This post will briefly review previous occurrences, offer some background on the recently resurrected discussions, and speculate about what may happen next.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Past&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) issued its first decision regarding the EU&amp;rsquo;s potential membership in the ECHR in 1996 (Opinion 2/94). The court determined at the time that the European Community lacked the legal capacity to join the ECHR (paras 34–35).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When the Lisbon Treaty came into effect in 2009, it established a legal foundation for accession. According to Article 6(2) TEU, the EU is required to join the ECHR, making this a legal obligation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The 14th Protocol to the ECHR prepared the ground for accession by adding Article 59(2) ECHR, which states that the EU may join the ECHR.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Accession Agreement was presented to the CJEU in 2013 in order to get an opinion on whether it complied with the treaties in accordance with Article 218(11) TFEU.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The court issued its landmark Opinion 2/13 the following year (discussed here), and despite strong arguments in favor of accession, it determined that the Accession Agreement was incompatible with EU law (para 258). It is intriguing to note that the European Commission, with the support of observing Member States (para 109), promoted the opposite stance (para 73).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Advocate General Kokott proposed a &amp;ldquo;qualified approval&amp;rdquo; of the Accession Agreement, implying that while the agreement is generally consistent with EU law, some adjustments are still necessary (paras 278–280). She also offered some ideas on how to reconcile the requirements of EU law with the accession (e.g., para 234).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Present&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the latter half of 2019, the EU and the Council of Europe both expressed a desire to move forward with discussions about the EU&amp;rsquo;s membership. The negotiations will occur as part of an ad hoc Group made up of one EU representative and members from each of the Council of Europe&amp;rsquo;s 47 member states (&amp;ldquo;47+1 Group&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The parties have formally agreed to restart talks on the EU&amp;rsquo;s membership in the ECHR as of January 2020. (For information on the accession process, visit the Council of Europe&amp;rsquo;s website.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At a first informal meeting in June 2020, the European Commission stated that it intended to carry out the accession through &amp;ldquo;modulations&amp;rdquo; to the Accession Agreement. These should guarantee that the EU&amp;rsquo;s distinctive qualities are preserved while yet adhering to the criteria outlined in Opinion 2/13. The speakers agreed that the CJEU&amp;rsquo;s concerns would necessitate considerable effort but were not insurmountable. It was made abundantly clear that the current discussions did not mark a fresh start for the accession process but rather picked up where they left off in 2013. This indicates that the Draft Accession Agreement establishes the parameters for the coming sessions and serves as a framework for the parties to operate within.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The European Commission identified four key areas of concern for the impending negotiations: the EU&amp;rsquo;s specific processes used in cases before the ECtHR, inter-party applications made in accordance with Article 33 ECHR, requests for advisory opinions from national courts to the European Convention of Human Rights made in accordance with Protocol No. 16, the principle of mutual trust, and the EU&amp;rsquo;s Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These subjects have been included in the agenda for the sixth round of negotiations, which will be the first formal meeting on accession since Opinion 2/13. In order to get ready for this meeting, the Chair of the 47+1 Group further separated them into subordinate concerns. A number of factors that may be important in finding a solution to the ten concerns mentioned were also covered in the Chair&amp;rsquo;s paper to guide the discussions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the meeting that was originally planned for March 2020 has been moved to September 29–October 1, 2020. (sixth round of negotiations). It is encouraging that the 47+1 Group decided at this meeting to increase the number of participants and the regularity of consultations with NGOs and other members of civil society. The meeting provided a summary of the various viewpoints on the concerns brought up in Opinion 2/13. However, the main debates were postponed until the following gathering.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The seventh round of negotiations, which took place from November 24 to 26, 2020, focused mostly on the EU&amp;rsquo;s unique procedures used in cases before the ECtHR, inter-party applications made in accordance with Article 33 ECHR, and requests for advisory opinions made in accordance with Protocol No. 16. Numerous ideas were floated, the majority of which required more research. Without a doubt, the meeting has shown a desire to come up with workable solutions and constructively develop them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next meeting is scheduled for February 2–4, 2021, at which point the subjects of mutual trust and the CFSP will be covered. The ninth round of negotiations is expected to take place in the latter half of March 2021.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Future&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The European Parliament must give its consent to the Accession Agreement in accordance with Article 218(6) TFEU. Only then may the Council approve a resolution that approves the agreement. The Accession Agreement should be signed after it has been ratified by the EU member states in line with their constitutional requirements, and the Council must do so unanimously (Article 218(8) TFEU).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As was previously indicated, the European Commission filed a request in accordance with the procedure outlined in Article 218(11) TFEU, which resulted in the issuance of Opinion 2/13. According to this clause, it was possible to receive an opinion on whether an agreement was consistent with the treaties. As a result, it is reasonable to wonder whether the CJEU will issue a new opinion on the revised Accession Agreement. In its request, the Commission emphasizes points that the CJEU has frequently emphasized in its opinions (see Opinions 2/13 and 2/94 for examples). The goal of such opinions was to &amp;ldquo;prevent problems that would come from legal disputes about the compatibility with the Treaty of international agreements that are binding on the Union&amp;rdquo; (para 60). The notion that the implementation of internal rules should be supported by the knowledge that the foundation for these rules is consistent with primary EU law is another justification for an opinion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The CJEU might not be the only body to have the opportunity to rule on the revised Accession Agreement. As Switzerland suggested at the June 2020 informal meeting, the ECtHR could be asked to provide its opinion on the agreement. This chance might be made possible by Article 47 ECHR. At the September meeting, the prospect of such an opinion was brought up once more, along with the caveat that the revised agreement would first need to be presented to the Council of Ministers for approval.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following CJEU approval, the Council of Ministers must adopt the revised Accession Agreement and then make it available for signatures. According to Article 59 ECHR, each of the Convention&amp;rsquo;s 47 High Contracting Parties will be required to ratify the revised agreement.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The meeting in June 2020 highlighted the significant hazards associated with a failed accession. Participants concurred that the problem required immediate attention and action. The objectives of legal certainty and uniformity in the application of human rights protections should be kept in mind at all times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even though it is unclear whether this round of negotiations will take as long as the previous one, which took three years, it is clear that we will need to exercise patience while we wait for a concrete outcome.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although Opinion 2/13 dashed our hopes, the 47+1 Group is not starting from scratch this time. Having said that, it is clear that everyone concerned needs to put a lot of effort into this project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s hope that the CJEU will wed the EU and the ECHR once the marriage contract has been finalized so that they can finally declare their relationship to be &amp;ldquo;married.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The EU&amp;rsquo;s accession to the ECHR: specifics of the resumed discussions&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Stian Øby Johansen,&lt;/strong> an associate professor at the University of Oslo&amp;rsquo;s Faculty of Law&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The initial discussion for renegotiation&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The report from the first renegotiation meeting, also known as the sixth negotiating meeting in CoE terminology to maintain continuity with the prior round, should be reviewed in conjunction with another important document, the &amp;ldquo;Paper by the Chair to steer the discussion at the 6th meeting of the CDDH ad hoc group (47+1),&amp;rdquo; which was created to provide structure for the discussions. Almost immediately following its approval in October 2019, a copy of the EU Commission&amp;rsquo;s negotiating mandate, a document that was closely guarded during the initial round of negotiations, was leaked.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>The main challenges confronting the negotiators&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Chair sought to structure the negotiations around four &amp;ldquo;baskets&amp;rdquo; of topics in her paper:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Basket 1:&lt;/strong> Processes used by the EU in cases before the ECtHR (co-respondent mechanism, prior CJEU involvement, shared responsibility).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Basket 2:&lt;/strong> Applying inter-party applications and seeking an advisory opinion from the ECtHR (Articles 33 and 16 of the ECHR).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Basket 3:&lt;/strong> EU member states&amp;rsquo; mutual trust.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Basket 4:&lt;/strong> Actions taken by the EU in relation to the Common Foreign and Security Policy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The negotiators had access to a range of &amp;ldquo;tools,&amp;rdquo; according to the Chair&amp;rsquo;s paper, such as changes to the ECHR and the Draft Accession Agreement (DAA), straightforward explanations of the DAA&amp;rsquo;s Explanatory Report, and pronouncements made when the DAA was signed. The Chair&amp;rsquo;s paper then moved on to examine the concerns in each basket, identifying the pertinent sections of the DAA and Opinion 2/13 for each issue as well as potential actions the 47+1 Group could take using the &amp;ldquo;tools&amp;rdquo; at its disposal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In other words, the Chair sought to take a proactive approach to make sure the conversations were focused on the most important topics. This method appears appropriate to me given the complexity of the work at hand. In fact, the Chair&amp;rsquo;s active participation was essential in bringing the initial round of discussions to a successful conclusion. Then, as now, the Norwegian delegate Tonje Meinich presided over the discussions, and in 2019 she wrote an article for The International Journal of Human Rights describing her interactions during the first round of discussions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The negotiating parties appear to have reacted favorably to the Chair&amp;rsquo;s paper. The meeting agenda was clearly written with the suggested &amp;ldquo;baskets&amp;rdquo; in mind. However, at least two delegations stated their intentions to bring up more topics during these renegotiations during the negotiation meeting (Meeting report, para 41). Additionally, one delegation inquired as to whether the ECtHR might provide an opinion on the renegotiated DAA (Meeting report, para 43).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Advancements Achieved at the Sixth Negotiating Session&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The baskets were covered in the sequence that they were presented at the sixth negotiating meeting. According to the meeting report, it looks that the first two baskets received the most in-depth consideration, with some progress being made, but the final two baskets were only briefly covered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No specific, written plans for changing the DAA or the other draught accession instruments appear to have been presented during the sixth round of negotiations. The discussions, however, generally advanced to the point where the Chair requested that concrete textual suggestions be made for consideration at the (seventh) negotiating meeting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the following, I&amp;rsquo;ll highlight the key points from the sixth round of discussions for each basket and evaluate the progress achieved.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>EU-specific mechanisms of the procedure before the ECtHR (&amp;ldquo;Basket 1&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Under this heading, a variety of sub-issues were covered, such as the co-called co-respondent mechanism, the co-called prior involvement procedure, and the conduct attribution/responsibility allocation between the Union and its Member States. According to the CJEU, they all have the drawback of possibly requiring the ECtHR to interpret how responsibilities are divided internally between the Union and its Member States.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Removing any threshold requirements for activating the purely procedural mechanisms—the co-respondent mechanism and the prior involvement procedure—would be the most clear-cut fix. This is due to the fact that, in accordance with the 2013 DAA, it was up to the ECtHR to determine whether those requirements had been satisfied. Despite the thresholds being so minimal that they practically amounted to a review of whether there had been an abuse of process, the CJEU nonetheless found them to be against EU law in Opinion 2/13.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the sixth round of negotiations, it was discussed making both the co-respondent process and the prior engagement procedure unconditional rights. With the exception of one delegation, there appears to have been general support for making the CJEU&amp;rsquo;s prior involvement an unconditional right (Meeting report, para 17). However, there were differing opinions on eliminating the bar for activating the co-respondent mechanism (Meeting report, paras 13–14).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a case involving both the Union and one or more Member States, the ECtHR&amp;rsquo;s incidental decisions regarding conduct attribution may clearly require an assessment of how responsibilities are distributed. This topic received extensive discussion in the run-up to the 2013 DAA discussions. When white smoke finally appeared, Article 3(7) of the 2013 DAA included a vague clause that provided for the shared accountability of all co-respondents (the Union and one or more Member States) &amp;ldquo;unless the Court decides that only one of them be held responsible.&amp;rdquo; Depending on how you interpret this clause, it could be anything from a strong assumption of shared responsibility to a carte blanche for the ECtHR to decide who is accountable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The CJEU determined in Opinion 2/13 that article 3(7) of the 2013 DAA was incompatible with Union law simply because of the possibility that the ECtHR might use the shared responsibility exception (paras 229–234). In fact, the CJEU appears to contend that the provision&amp;rsquo;s mere existence is against Union law, even if it is understood to be a practically insurmountable presumption.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most obvious &amp;ldquo;fix&amp;rdquo; for this CJEU complaint is to simply remove the exception. Although some people supported this notion during the sixth round of negotiations, it was not universally accepted (Meeting report, para 16). One delegation also &amp;ldquo;as a point of principle&amp;rdquo; opposed the notion that a participant in ECtHR proceedings should be able to &amp;ldquo;establish the guidelines for how it will participate&amp;rdquo; and hence enjoy a privileged status (ibid). The Chair requested specific drafting recommendations for the (seventh) negotiating session that would follow. Based on my observations from the discussions that resulted in the 2013 DAA, I anticipate that the differences between the &amp;ldquo;EU side&amp;rdquo; and the Non-EU CoE States will become very obvious once they begin to consider specific proposals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The seemingly complicated subject of how to handle ECHR reservations made by an EU Member State that is also a co-respondent with the Union was also covered. Interestingly, though, the 47+1 were able to come to an understanding that &amp;ldquo;such reservation would remain valid&amp;rdquo; (Meeting report, para 15). The following negotiating session was supposed to cover concrete drafting recommendations for putting that agreement into practice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The negotiators also covered the demand for a system that would systematically notify the Union of cases before the ECtHR where the co-respondent process and prior involvement procedure might be applicable under this basket (Meeting report, para 18). It should come as no surprise that some people questioned why the ECtHR should be in charge of informing the Union rather than the EU Member States. In fact, when determining whether a case also raises matters of Union law, the EU Member States are likely in a better position to do so than the ECtHR. However, no conclusive response was given at the sixth negotiating session. All possibilities remained available, and this subject will be revisited at the seventh negotiating session.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Operation of inter-party applications and of references for an advisory opinion by the ECtHR (“Basket 2”)&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The fact that EU member states might theoretically utilize these two seemingly unrelated strategies to circumvent TFEU rules, particularly the infamous Article 344, connects them (Meeting report, para 20), which stipulates that EU member states must utilize EU law procedures in the event of disagreements about EU law amongst themselves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In Opinion 2/13, the CJEU stated that &amp;ldquo;only the explicit exclusion of the ECtHR&amp;rsquo;s jurisdiction under Article 33 of the ECHR over disputes between Member States [&amp;hellip;] within the scope ration material of EU law&amp;rdquo; would be compatible with Article 344 TFEU, addressing the subject of inter-party applications (ECHR article 33). (Para 213). In other words, the CJEU determined that the 2013 DAA was incompatible with that provision because of the &amp;ldquo;very existence of such a possibility&amp;rdquo;—i.e., that a Member State might initiate an inter-party lawsuit in violation of Article 344 (Opinion 2/13, para 208).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some Non-EU CoE Members expressed strong opposition to amending the ECHR to address this CJEU criticism during the sixth negotiating session (Meeting report, para 22). These states appear to have—in my opinion, correctly—viewed this as an internal matter between the Union and its Member States. As I have previously stated, the CJEU revised Article 344 TFEU in Opinion 2/13, creating stricter standards. Because of Opinion 2/13, it is now almost difficult for the Union and its Member States to enter into international agreements with effective dispute resolution procedures. Both the wording of Article 344 TFEU and prior CJEU jurisprudence seemed to imply that the mere inclusion in an agreement of a mechanism by which Member States may violate Article 344 TFEU was not problematic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a result, it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t come as a surprise that I support the ECtHR Registry representative&amp;rsquo;s suggestion made during the sixth negotiating session, which was that &amp;ldquo;the very foundation of the CJEU&amp;rsquo;s statement in Opinion 2/13 that the use of Article 33 ECHR should be expressly prohibited [&amp;hellip;] would not be consistent with Convention case-law and should perhaps be reevaluated&amp;rdquo; (Meeting report, para 24). Ignoring some CJEU objections in this way, in the hopes that the CJEU has changed its mind in recent years, is definitely risky. However, I believe it is preferable to err on the side of a possible second negative Opinion than to go too far in the direction of granting the Union special treatment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Possible &amp;ldquo;solutions&amp;rdquo; were explored, such as putting inter-party ECtHR actions on hold until the CJEU had determined whether they violated Article 344 TFEU (Meeting report, para 26). However, none of these remedies satisfy the CJEU&amp;rsquo;s actual requirements, therefore they all run the danger of receiving a second bad Opinion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Chair wrapped up the debate on Article 344 TFEU by stating that &amp;ldquo;no delegation had spoken out against the general idea that inter-party applications brought before the ECtHR in violation of EU law were undesirable and should be avoided&amp;rdquo; (Meeting report, para 27). She also observed that there was &amp;ldquo;sufficient interest&amp;rdquo; in looking into other options, such as putting ECtHR actions on hold (ibid).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In Opinion 2/13, the CJEU objected to national courts&amp;rsquo; requests for advisory opinions from the ECtHR in accordance with ECHR Protocol 16 on the grounds that domestic courts could get around the preliminary reference procedure for EU law found in TFEU Article 267. (para 198). This section of Opinion 2/13 makes it clear that the CJEU&amp;rsquo;s main worry is not that it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be consulted before the ECtHR issues an advisory opinion, but rather that a request for an advisory opinion would set off the 2013 DAA prior involvement procedure. As a result, a domestic court brings the issue before the CJEU using a procedure other than Article 267 TFEU.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This criticism was always a little perplexing. First, it is challenging to comprehend why the CJEU&amp;rsquo;s jurisdiction should be based on either Article 267 TFEU or the DAA prior involvement procedure. The CJEU never explicitly states what the issue would be. Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s only the fact that the prior participation was supposed to follow an expedited process (&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/UE_Report_CDDH_ENG.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>2013 DAA article 3(6) and Explanatory Report para 69&lt;/a>), possibly creating a &amp;ldquo;fast track&amp;rdquo; to a CJEU opinion in matters involving both EU law and fundamental rights? Second, the CJEU doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear to have faith that its Member States and their domestic courts will abide by the regulations. This mistrust is also apparent in the CJEU&amp;rsquo;s aforementioned concerns about Article 344 TFEU.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the sixth round of negotiations, very little headway was made. Only two initial conclusions appear to have been reached by the 47+1 Group. First, the CJEU&amp;rsquo;s objections to ECHR Protocol 16 weren&amp;rsquo;t as strongly worded as those it had about Article 344 TFEU. Second, the existing wording of paragraph 66 of the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/UE_Report_CDDH_ENG.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>DAA Explanatory Report&lt;/a> &amp;ldquo;states that the application of the prior involvement-procedure would presuppose an application which the co-respondent mechanism applies.&amp;rdquo; However, it is unclear what the latter point of agreement actually signifies or accomplishes. However, given that the 2013 DAA&amp;rsquo;s clauses addressing the co-respondent mechanism consistently employ the phrase &amp;ldquo;application,&amp;rdquo; perhaps this agreement implicitly assumes that the co-respondent mechanism does not apply to requests for advisory opinions under Protocol 16 (Article 3)? However, if the co-respondent mechanism is not used in Protocol 16 cases, the ECtHR might have to make a &amp;ldquo;Basket 1&amp;rdquo; decision about how responsibilities are divided between the Union and a Member State.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Are there any ways around these predicaments? In my opinion, there are at least two. First, EU-internal solutions are a clear option for addressing the Protocol 16 issue. A radical but successful solution would be for the Union and the EU Member States to come to an agreement not to ratify Protocol 16. (or for those who have already done so, to leave). Along the same lines, less drastic measures could be taken.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Second, there is always the possibility of relying on the CJEU to have changed its mind and forgoing any substantive revisions to the 2013 DAA. Given the CJEU&amp;rsquo;s distrustful attitude toward its Member States on the &amp;ldquo;Basket 2&amp;rdquo; concerns in Opinion 2/13, this might be a feasible, and maybe even preferred, course of action. However, it never hurts to carefully consider different solutions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>The principle of mutual trust between EU Member States (“Basket 3”)&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The principle of mutual trust in Union law may clash with the ECHR system if applied rigorously. This is due to the fact that, according to the CJEU in Opinion 2/13, this idea &amp;ldquo;requires EU Member States to &amp;ldquo;presume that other Member States have upheld fundamental rights&amp;rdquo; in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (AFSJ) (para 198, emphasis added). Therefore, barring exceptional circumstances, an EU member state may &amp;ldquo;verify whether that other Member State has actually, in a specific case, observed [&amp;hellip;] fundamental rights&amp;rdquo; (ibid). In contrast, the ECHR&amp;rsquo;s non-refoulement commitments did not make a distinction between whether or not the participating High Contracting Parties belonged to the same economic integration group.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Both courts have somewhat dismounted their high horses since 2014.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ECtHR Grand Chamber recognized the &amp;ldquo;significance of the mutual recognition mechanisms&amp;rdquo; for Union law in &lt;em>&lt;a class="link" href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-163114" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Avotiņš&lt;/a>&lt;/em> (which I discussed &lt;a class="link" href="http://eulawanalysis.blogspot.com/2016/05/eu-law-and-echr-bosphorus-presumption.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here&lt;/a>). The ECtHR&amp;rsquo;s recognition of the principle&amp;rsquo;s significance, however, came right before it stated that &amp;ldquo;the goal of effectiveness sought by some of the procedures employed [in the AFSJ, such as mutual trust,] leads to the review of the observance of fundamental rights being strictly controlled or even constrained&amp;rdquo; (para 114).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For its part, the CJEU has considerably expanded the exceptions to mutual trust in cases involving fundamental rights since 2014, most notably in the matters of &lt;em>&lt;a class="link" href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=C-182/15" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>It may no longer imply blind trust&lt;/a>, but exceptions to mutual trust are still, well, exceptional.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The 47+1 group merely touched the surface of this basket during the sixth round of negotiations, briefly noting the &amp;ldquo;increased convergence&amp;rdquo; between the two courts&amp;rsquo; case law and assigning the CoE secretariat the responsibility of compiling the case law for the upcoming (seventh) negotiation meeting. (&lt;a class="link" href="https://rm.coe.int/compilation-of-cases-in-the-area-of-basket-3-47-1-2020-4-eng-/1680a068e6" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>this compilation was later published on the CoE accession website&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>EU acts in the area of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (“Basket 4”)&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The 2013 DAA sought to give the ECtHR authority over behavior taken out under the EU&amp;rsquo;s Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), a program that is at least partially outside of the purview of the CJEU. This resulted from the 2013 DAA&amp;rsquo;s straightforward failure to differentiate between policy areas. In fact, this outcome appears to be required by the idea that the EU should join the ECHR on an equal footing with other High Contracting Parties. No ECHR signatory has the right to exclude any policy areas from the ECtHR&amp;rsquo;s purview.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a move that &lt;a class="link" href="http://eulawanalysis.blogspot.com/2014/12/the-cjeu-and-eus-accession-to-echr.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Steve Peers aptly dubbed &amp;ldquo;judicial politics of the playground,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>, the CJEU held in Opinion 2/13 that because it lacked jurisdiction over (parts of) the CFSP, no other international court could either. The CJEU claimed that the 2013 DAA &amp;ldquo;failed to take into account the unique characteristics of EU law with regard to [&amp;hellip;] judicial review [&amp;hellip;] in CFSP matters&amp;rdquo; by permitting the ECtHR to rule on cases involving CFSP-related conduct (Opinion 2/13, para 257).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finding a solution to this problem without jeopardizing the ECHR system is obviously difficult. Even though the CJEU&amp;rsquo;s case law on the scope of the CFSP jurisdictional exemption has changed since 2014 (see &lt;a class="link" href="http://eulawanalysis.blogspot.com/2020/10/action-for-damages-in-relation-to-cfsp.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>this discussion&lt;/a> of the most recent pertinent judgment, which includes more links), it is still true that certain CFSP actions—including those that might violate human rights—are excluded (see e.g., &lt;a class="link" href="https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108862608.004" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Johansen 2020, Ch 4&lt;/a>, particularly at 142–144). As a result, the CJEU&amp;rsquo;s jurisdiction over CFSP matters has not (yet) been expanded to save the DAA.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the sixth round of negotiations, little headway was made in identifying a solution. There was discussion of well-known ideas like incorporating a &amp;ldquo;clear attribution clause&amp;rdquo; (Meeting report, paras 37–38). However, because the CJEU&amp;rsquo;s objections in Opinion 2/13 were founded on its lack of authority over CFSP actions, it is unclear what an attribution clause would accomplish. For the purposes of the ECHR, automatically attributing CFSP acts to the Member States—either jointly or separately from the Union—does not seem to have any bearing on this problem. It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t exempt the CFSP from the ECtHR&amp;rsquo;s purview, and it certainly wouldn&amp;rsquo;t increase the CJEU&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the end, the Chair came to the apathetic conclusion that &amp;ldquo;there was a common goal by the delegations [&amp;hellip;] that, in order to avoid &amp;lsquo;black holes&amp;rsquo; in the European human rights protection, the Convention system should be able to accommodate all acts in the CFSP area. Ultimately, the challenge was to determine the best course of action to take in order to achieve this (Meeting report, para 39).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Additional Issues Raised&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some delegations brought up extra points that weren&amp;rsquo;t covered by the four &amp;ldquo;baskets&amp;rdquo; at the end of the sixth negotiation session.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Chair and the CoE Secretariat first brought up the subject of how ECHR article 53 and EU Charter of Fundamental Rights article 53 related to the minimum standards clauses (Meeting report, para 40). In order to address the CJEU&amp;rsquo;s concerns about the coordination of these two provisions in Opinion 2/13, it was initially proposed that their connection be clarified in the DAA&amp;rsquo;s Explanatory Report.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Two delegations then noted that there had been modifications to the CoE since the 2013 DAA&amp;rsquo;s adoption, necessitating a revision of articles 6, 7, and 8 of the DAA (dealing with the Union&amp;rsquo;s participation in CoE organs and its financial contribution to the CoE) to reflect these changes (Meeting report, para 41). These delegations also stated that they would bring up further points, as was already indicated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One delegation finally inquired about the possibility of requesting an opinion from the ECtHR on the renegotiated DAA, as was previously mentioned (Meeting report, para 43). Asking the ECtHR for such an opinion would be technically permissible in accordance with ECHR article 47. I believe that doing so would be a wise move. When the CJEU is inevitably asked to provide its opinion on the renegotiated DAA, a favorable opinion from the ECtHR may be able to sway the court. Furthermore, it&amp;rsquo;s unlikely that waiting for an ECtHR opinion will cause much of a delay. It might even be possible to simultaneously request opinions from both courts. If so, I anticipate that the ECtHR will be able to provide an opinion more quickly than the CJEU. &lt;a class="link" href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/fre?i=003-3004688-3312583" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>The last time the ECtHR was asked to provide an opinion under ECHR article 47, it only took about six months.&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Conclusion&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although negotiations have begun, it is already obvious that they will require some time. Several of the CJEU&amp;rsquo;s objections in Opinion 2/13 are with regard to topics that were very sensitive during the DAA discussions in 2013. From the perspective of the non-EU Member States of the CoE, the negotiations are essentially being reopened in order to address largely internal matters between the EU and its Member States. This is a recurring theme in EU foreign policy: the outsourcing of matters that, at least in my opinion, should be handled internally.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The negotiations are expected to be rather difficult in light of this. However, it is hoped that these challenges can be resolved without jeopardizing the ECHR system. If not, there is only one option left: change EU primary law to counteract the effects of Opinion 2/13.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Second Renegotiation Meeting&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Despite some progress being achieved at the meeting on November 24–26, 2020 (which I will refer to as the 7th meeting from the commencement of discussions), it is becoming more and more evident from reading the meeting report that no quick resolutions are in sight.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The following is a quick summary and assessment of the progress accomplished. I&amp;rsquo;ll start by listing the topics that weren&amp;rsquo;t covered at all during the seventh meeting, followed by the ones that were. Finally, I&amp;rsquo;ll briefly discuss other matters covered at the seventh meeting, such as the dialogue with civil society.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Issues Postponed for Future Meetings&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Only topics pertaining to the first two of the four baskets previously established were covered during the meeting. The final two, and arguably the most challenging ones, which dealt with mutual trust between EU member states (&amp;ldquo;Basket 3&amp;rdquo;) and the status of EU actions in the CFSP sector that are outside the purview of the CJEU, were not covered at all (&amp;ldquo;Basket 4&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although no specific justification was given for not addressing problems related to &amp;ldquo;Baskets&amp;rdquo; 3 and 4, it&amp;rsquo;s likely that there wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough time. The 47+1 group will revisit the matter at its upcoming (8th) meeting, according to the meeting report.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Issues Covered at the Seventh Meeting&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The EU side had presented concrete suggestions concerning both &amp;ldquo;Baskets&amp;rdquo; 1 and 2 since the sixth meeting. Therefore, these two issues were front and center at the seventh gathering.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Regrettably, the general public is not allowed access to the precise proposals. The paper in question is most likely the &amp;ldquo;Negotiation Document presented by the European Union on 2 November 2020,&amp;rdquo; which is designated as &amp;ldquo;restricted,&amp;rdquo; according to the list of working documents attached to the meeting report. A certain amount of (qualified) guesswork is required when evaluating the meeting report because there is no information available on the precise proposal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&amp;ldquo;BASKET 1&amp;rdquo;: MECHANISMS SPECIFIC TO THE EU USED IN ECTHR PROCEEDINGS&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The 2013 DAA, article 3(2), stated that the Union could only join a case against a Member State as a &amp;ldquo;co-respondent&amp;rdquo; if certain requirements were satisfied. A crucial factor was whether the complainant&amp;rsquo;s charges &amp;ldquo;appear&amp;rdquo; to call into question the compatibility of the Union&amp;rsquo;s founding treaties with the ECHR. The ECtHR was to determine whether it was &amp;ldquo;plausible&amp;rdquo; that this low threshold condition (&amp;ldquo;appears&amp;rdquo;) was met, as stated in article 3(5) of the 2013 DAA.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The CJEU determined in &lt;em>&lt;a class="link" href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?pro=AVIS&amp;amp;num=c-2/13" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

He highlights the challenge of managing complex queries and Data Definition Language (DDL) scripts during deployment, especially for customizations requiring custom tables in multiple company databases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Endow emphasizes the convenience of deploying AddIns by simply copying the DLL file and seeks to automate SQL script execution.

&lt;p>A UK exit from the European Union, or &amp;ldquo;Brexit,&amp;rdquo; could have significant implications for young people, impacting their education, travel opportunities, and economic prospects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Education&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The EU does not control educational content or matters like tuition costs. Instead, its involvement lies in cross-border educational aspects, including promoting student and teacher mobility through initiatives like the Erasmus program. Established in 1987, this EU law-based program facilitates student exchanges across various educational levels.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Brexit raises concerns about the UK&amp;rsquo;s continued involvement in Erasmus. Currently, full participation is limited to EU members, countries with free movement agreements (like Norway), or those seeking EU membership. Given the Vote Leave campaign&amp;rsquo;s stance against free movement, the UK might lose full access. The EU could amend the rules, but the example of Switzerland&amp;rsquo;s exclusion after ending its free movement treaty suggests this is unlikely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beyond Erasmus, Brexit could affect UK students studying in the EU in other ways. They may lose the benefit of paying local tuition fees, face obstacles in qualification recognition by employers, and encounter difficulties moving to EU countries for studies exceeding three months due to visa requirements and immigration laws.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Travel&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While short trips might remain unaffected, longer stays face uncertainties. A Leave campaigner, Dominic Raab, proposed imposing visa requirements on EU citizens post-Brexit, implying reciprocal visa requirements for UK citizens traveling to the EU.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This would involve a €60 application fee per adult per visit, processing fees, potential delays, and the possibility of visa denials. Stays exceeding three months would become more complex without free movement, subjecting individuals to stricter national immigration laws.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Economy&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Brexit&amp;rsquo;s economic impact on young Britons is debated, with varying forecasts. Some economists predict negative short-term consequences, potentially leading to job losses, a concern for young people entering the workforce. While a positive long-term impact is anticipated, it might not benefit those seeking immediate employment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Conclusion&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Brexit&amp;rsquo;s full impact on young people remains uncertain. However, it potentially jeopardizes access to Erasmus, creates hurdles for those wanting to live and work in the EU, and raises concerns about job prospects in the short term. While exploring opportunities beyond the EU is possible, Brexit may limit options for young Britons wishing to study, work, or travel within Europe.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By Steve Peers&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The initial Common European Asylum System (CEAS) legislation defined &amp;lsquo;subsidiary protection,&amp;rsquo; which protects individuals ineligible for refugee status but shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be returned to their home country. However, other initial CEAS legislation, particularly the asylum procedures Directive, didn&amp;rsquo;t cover those seeking subsidiary protection or clarify the connection between refugee and subsidiary protection statuses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This gap has been addressed in several ways. Firstly, future second-phase CEAS legislation fully applies to subsidiary protection applicants and defines the relationship between refugee and subsidiary protection statuses. However, some of this legislation, notably the Directive on international protection procedures (replacing the asylum procedures Directive), won&amp;rsquo;t apply until applications made after July 2015.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Secondly, many Member States use a &amp;lsquo;one-stop shop&amp;rsquo; procedure, evaluating subsidiary protection applications alongside refugee protection applications. Here, the asylum procedures Directive applies to the entire process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thirdly, in Member States without this procedure, the CJEU in the M judgment determined that the general EU law principle of the &amp;lsquo;right to good administration&amp;rsquo; (Article 41 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights) applies to national subsidiary protection claim assessments, even though the Charter limits this right to EU bodies, not national administrations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The recent judgment in HN raises more questions about subsidiary protection claim procedures in Member States without a &amp;lsquo;one-stop shop&amp;rsquo; and has broader implications. Like the M case, HN involves a subsidiary protection application in Ireland. Irish law mandates separate procedures for assessing refugee and subsidiary protection statuses, resolving the former before the latter. Mr. HN, believing he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t receive refugee status but had a strong case for subsidiary protection, argued that these rules violated EU law.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The CJEU disagreed. Firstly, given the Geneva Convention&amp;rsquo;s emphasis on refugee status in Treaties and secondary EU law, subsidiary protection is &amp;lsquo;intended for third country nationals who do not qualify for refugee status&amp;rsquo;. Consequently, &amp;lsquo;an application for subsidiary protection should not, in principle, be considered before&amp;rsquo; an authority rejects an application for refugee status. Therefore, this aspect of national law wasn&amp;rsquo;t flawed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The CJEU also examined two EU law aspects: effectiveness and the right to good administration. Regarding effectiveness, while Member States have some leeway in regulating the subsidiary protection process without a &amp;lsquo;one-stop shop,&amp;rsquo; this discretion is limited. Since a two-step process causes delays, applying for both statuses simultaneously must be possible, with the subsidiary protection claim considered &amp;lsquo;within a reasonable period,&amp;rsquo; factoring in the time spent on the refugee claim.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Concerning good administration, the CJEU confirmed that Article 41 of the Charter applies to national proceedings connected to EU law. Here, the relevant provisions were impartial decisions and decisions within a reasonable time. The &amp;lsquo;reasonable time&amp;rsquo; rule mirrors the effectiveness principle. Additionally, the impartiality principle wasn&amp;rsquo;t breached simply because the applicant, due to his unsuccessful refugee claim, was informed of potential deportation before the subsidiary protection decision.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This ruling has several broader implications. Firstly, confirming that Article 41 of the Charter applies to all national proceedings under EU law is significant beyond asylum law, given national administrations&amp;rsquo; large role in implementing EU law. This finding could be relevant for immigration, free movement, or tax decisions, among others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Secondly, while the judgment focuses on impartial decisions and decisions within a reasonable time, other Article 41 aspects must apply equally to national administrative decisions linked to EU law. In the M judgment, the CJEU already mentioned the right to be heard. Article 41 also covers fair administration, file access, reasoned decisions, damages rights, and linguistic communication rights.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For asylum law, the judgment logically means Article 47 of the Charter (right to a court and effective remedy) also applies to subsidiary protection claims by analogy, even in Member States without a one-stop shop. Arguably, the EU Charter&amp;rsquo;s rights to dignity and social protection apply to subsidiary protection applicants in such Member States.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Court&amp;rsquo;s reasoning in M and HN is relevant by analogy to cases where individuals seek refugee or subsidiary protection in Member States from outside EU territory, such as after interception at sea. While the asylum procedures Directive doesn&amp;rsquo;t apply outside EU territory, the qualification Directive has no such geographic limit. Logically, the latter applies to claims made outside EU territory to Member States, and the Charter applies to procedural rights in such cases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Court&amp;rsquo;s approach to the relationship between refugee and subsidiary protection applications will make it tougher for applicants to avoid the EU&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Dublin&amp;rsquo; asylum case allocation rules by withdrawing a refugee application while simultaneously submitting or maintaining a subsidiary protection application. However, this is only relevant to applications before 2014, as the Dublin III Regulation, extending &amp;lsquo;Dublin&amp;rsquo; rules to subsidiary protection, applies from that date onward.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Regarding the relationship between refugee status and purely national forms of protection outside the qualification Directive, the ruling doesn&amp;rsquo;t address their relationship with the Directive or other EU asylum law (like Dublin rules). It&amp;rsquo;s still arguable, for instance, that Dublin rules don&amp;rsquo;t apply if someone solely seeks national protection. Conversely, one might argue that the HN judgment applies by analogy if a Member State grants an applicant for refugee and/or subsidiary protection a less advantageous national status without considering the former claims on their merits.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s clear that a refugee status claim must always be rejected before considering subsidiary protection. This applies even before the second-phase procedures Directive codifies it, impacting applications before July 2015, including pending ones. A Member State granting subsidiary protection without assessing a refugee application&amp;rsquo;s merits could be required to reopen the process. However, further case law might be needed to clarify situations where someone appeals a refugee status rejection while the subsidiary protection claim is ongoing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lastly, although the UK and Ireland opted into only the first-phase qualification and procedures Directives, some key second-phase rules still bind them due to the CJEU&amp;rsquo;s interpretation of first-phase rules. Specifically, they must follow basic procedural rules for subsidiary protection applications; consider refugee claims before subsidiary protection claims; and decide within a reasonable time frame (though less precise than the second-phase Directive&amp;rsquo;s time limits). Therefore, a rule&amp;rsquo;s presence in the second-phase but not the first-phase law doesn&amp;rsquo;t automatically exclude the UK and Ireland; the first-phase legislation might implicitly contain it. This highlights the legal complexities of the EU law opt-out system.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Professor &lt;strong>Steve Peers&lt;/strong>, University of Essex&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As an EU law and human rights professor for over two decades, the topic of sanctioning Member States for human rights violations was once straightforward. The enforcement procedure (Article 7 TEU) was never used, making in-depth discussions unnecessary. My focus remained on practical issues like arrest warrants and asylum seekers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the landscape has shifted. Like Article 50, which also addresses the EU&amp;rsquo;s relationship with Member States, Article 7 seems hastily drafted without considering its practical application, possibly because its creators never anticipated its use. Now, both articles are at the forefront of political and legal debate, marking a significant turning point in EU law.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Two major developments are unfolding. Firstly, Article 7 procedures have been initiated against both Poland (by the European Commission) and Hungary (by the European Parliament). Secondly, recent case law raises concerns about Member States&amp;rsquo; adherence to human rights and the rule of law outside the specific Article 7 framework. Notably, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) recently issued its first judgment declaring a Member State&amp;rsquo;s judicial reforms as infringing upon judicial independence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The possibility of the EU imposing sanctions on its Member States for violating human rights and the rule of law raises fundamental legal and political questions best understood within a historical context. In light of these developments and ongoing disputes, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to analyze this issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This analysis will be presented in a three-part blog series:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>a) The legal framework for sanctions under Article 7&lt;/p>
&lt;p>b) The intersection of sanction rules with other EU law aspects (now published)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>c) The historical context and broader constitutional dynamics (forthcoming)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The legal framework for sanctions&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While Article 7 TEU is frequently cited, other Treaty provisions are closely linked: Article 2 TEU outlines the values Article 7 aims to uphold; Article 354 TFEU defines voting rules for EU institutions; and Article 269 TFEU grants limited jurisdiction to the CJEU over the sanctions process. These must be distinguished from standard EU law rules, discussed in the second blog post.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, what are the EU&amp;rsquo;s values from a legal standpoint? Article 2 TEU states:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;The Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities. These values are common to the Member States in a society in which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Article 7 outlines the process of upholding these values. Article 7(1) acts as a &amp;ldquo;yellow card&amp;rdquo; – a warning issued if &amp;ldquo;there is a clear risk of a serious breach&amp;rdquo; of these values:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;1. On a reasoned proposal by one third of the Member States, by the European Parliament or by the European Commission, the Council, acting by a majority of four fifths of its members after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament, may determine that there is a clear risk of a serious breach by a Member State of the values referred to in Article 2. Before making such a determination, the Council shall hear the Member State in question and may address recommendations to it, acting in accordance with the same procedure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Council shall regularly verify that the grounds on which such a determination was made continue to apply.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The European Parliament, a group of Member States, or the Commission can initiate this &amp;ldquo;yellow card&amp;rdquo; process. Contrary to common belief, unanimous agreement from Member States isn&amp;rsquo;t required for the Council to issue a &amp;ldquo;yellow card.&amp;rdquo; However, the threshold of four-fifths of Member States&amp;rsquo; governments in the Council is substantial. Initiating the process, as seen with Hungary and Poland, doesn&amp;rsquo;t guarantee the Council&amp;rsquo;s agreement to issue a &amp;ldquo;yellow card.&amp;rdquo; Currently, the Council is still evaluating the proposals for both countries, having conducted several hearings. A &amp;ldquo;yellow card,&amp;rdquo; if issued, doesn&amp;rsquo;t constitute a sanction but signifies a risk to EU values with potential recommendations. Nonetheless, it carries significant political weight.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Article 7(2) represents the &amp;ldquo;red card&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;2. The European Council, acting by unanimity on a proposal by one third of the Member States or by the Commission and after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament, may determine the existence of a serious and persistent breach by a Member State of the values referred to in Article 2, after inviting the Member State in question to submit its observations.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This procedure is more stringent, demanding unanimity among Member States. The European Parliament can&amp;rsquo;t initiate this process but holds veto power. The threshold is higher: not just a risk of a breach, but &amp;ldquo;the existence of a serious and persistent breach.&amp;rdquo; Reaching the &amp;ldquo;red card&amp;rdquo; stage likely follows a &amp;ldquo;yellow card,&amp;rdquo; though a &amp;ldquo;straight red&amp;rdquo; is possible in cases like a sudden military coup.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Article 7(3) outlines the consequences of a &amp;ldquo;red card&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;…the Council, acting by a qualified majority, may decide to suspend certain of the rights deriving from the application of the Treaties to the Member State in question, including the voting rights of the representative of the government of that Member State in the Council. In doing so, the Council shall take into account the possible consequences of such a suspension on the rights and obligations of natural and legal persons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The obligations of the Member State in question under the Treaties shall in any case continue to be binding on that State.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Notably, unanimous agreement among Member States in the Council isn&amp;rsquo;t required when determining sanctions for the non-compliant member. Unanimity only applies when deciding if a serious and persistent breach occurred. While the Treaty cites the suspension of voting rights as a potential sanction, the Council can impose others, such as suspending MEPs&amp;rsquo; voting rights, raising concerns about silencing opposition voices from the sanctioned Member State. However, the obligation to consider the rights of individuals and businesses suggests trade sanctions might be problematic. Restricting free movement rights might also be difficult to justify, but specific rules exist for EU citizens seeking asylum from a &amp;ldquo;red card&amp;rdquo; Member State (discussed further in the second blog post).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Significantly, there&amp;rsquo;s no provision to expel a Member State from the EU. However, a suspended Member State might be compelled to trigger Article 50 and initiate its exit. Considering the UK&amp;rsquo;s complex and contentious withdrawal, envision the legal and political ramifications of a Member State under Article 7 sanctions triggering Article 50. Would the actions of its political authorities be considered legitimate? What if exiled groups claiming to be the rightful government, opposed to leaving the EU, emerge? What happens if a region disagreeing with the government&amp;rsquo;s stance on EU membership and its violation of EU values attempts secession?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The possibility of withdrawal, alongside concerns about sovereignty and political dynamics, might explain the EU&amp;rsquo;s hesitation to utilize Article 7.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Article 7(4) TEU allows the Council, by a qualified majority, to adjust or revoke sanctions against a Member State based on changes in the situation that led to their imposition. Article 7(5) directs us to Article 354 TFEU for voting rules within institutions during Article 7 proceedings. It states that the Member State facing potential sanctions has no voting rights throughout the process, as it would hinder decisions on EU values breaches. Abstentions can&amp;rsquo;t block a &amp;ldquo;red card&amp;rdquo; decision. If the Council votes to implement it, a higher threshold for passing EU laws applies (72% of participating Member States in favor, instead of the usual 55%). If voting rights are suspended, standard Council voting rules with limited Member State participation apply. The European Parliament &amp;ldquo;shall act by a two-thirds majority of the votes cast, representing the majority of its component Members.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Article 269 TFEU significantly limits the CJEU&amp;rsquo;s role in the sanctions process:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;The Court of Justice shall have jurisdiction to decide on the legality of an act adopted by the European Council or by the Council pursuant to Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union solely at the request of the Member State concerned by a determination of the European Council or of the Council and in respect solely of the procedural stipulations contained in that Article.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Such a request must be made within one month from the date of such determination. The Court shall rule within one month from the date of the request.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The legal issues&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to limited judicial oversight, the Article 7 process is inherently political, making some legal questions hypothetical.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Firstly, the scope of issues covered by Article 7 is broad. Claims suggesting it only addresses EU law breaches are inaccurate. Articles 2 and 7 make no mention of such limitations. In fact, restricting Article 7&amp;rsquo;s scope to EU law breaches seems illogical given Article 269 TFEU&amp;rsquo;s limitation on the Court&amp;rsquo;s jurisdiction while other Treaty provisions (discussed further in the next post) grant the Court extensive jurisdiction over enforcing standard EU law.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The claim of limited scope becomes even more illogical when considering the broader context. For instance, if a Member State detains LGBT individuals in camps, a narrow interpretation of Article 7 would limit the EU&amp;rsquo;s response to discriminatory employment access for those detained. While a valid concern, it ignores the core issue of detaining individuals based on sexual orientation. (EU law addresses LGBT refugees, but Article 7 must be triggered first for it to apply to EU citizen refugees).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Therefore, Article 7 clearly isn&amp;rsquo;t intended to be restricted in this manner. Its broad scope partly explains the CJEU&amp;rsquo;s limited jurisdiction – to avoid granting it authority over matters typically outside EU law. Another reason is the intent to keep Article 7 under political, not judicial, control.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, Article 7 and regular EU law can overlap. The Court can exercise its regular jurisdiction to address issues discussed within the Article 7 process and vice versa. This was evident in the recent judgment concerning Poland and the rule of law, as the issues also factored into the Commission&amp;rsquo;s Article 7 case against Poland. The Advocate General&amp;rsquo;s opinion explicitly addressed this overlap, arguing that &amp;ldquo;there are firm grounds for finding that Article 7 TEU and Article 258 TFEU are separate procedures and may be invoked at the same time.&amp;rdquo; Utilizing standard EU law to address Member States&amp;rsquo; breaches of human rights or the rule of law is discussed in the next blog post.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How does the Court&amp;rsquo;s limited jurisdiction over Article 7 function in practice? Article 269 TFEU&amp;rsquo;s wording covers decisions related to both &amp;ldquo;yellow card&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;red card&amp;rdquo; scenarios. It seemingly applies to the implementation of sanctions as well, referring to any Council actions pursuant to Article 7 TEU. However, the use of the word &amp;ldquo;determination&amp;rdquo; causes confusion, as Article 7 employs it solely for decisions regarding potential or actual breaches of EU values, not for sanction implementation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Furthermore, only the sanctioned Member State can challenge decisions under Article 7, excluding other Member States, EU institutions, individuals, or businesses. If individuals can&amp;rsquo;t challenge the validity of Article 7 implementation decisions, even indirectly through national courts to the CJEU, how can the Council&amp;rsquo;s obligation to &amp;ldquo;take into account the possible consequences of such a suspension on the rights and obligations of natural and legal persons&amp;rdquo; be enforced? However, national courts can still request the Court to interpret decisions implementing sanctions, potentially clarifying their impact on individuals. If Council decisions under Article 7 disapply specific aspects of standard EU law, the Court should retain jurisdiction to interpret the application of such standard EU law.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A CJEU judgment under Article 269 TFEU can only address procedural matters, not the substance of the case. In other words, the Court can&amp;rsquo;t rule on whether a Member State actually violated (or risks violating) EU values. However, as we&amp;rsquo;ll explore in the second post, the evolving case law on the interplay between Article 7 and &amp;ldquo;ordinary&amp;rdquo; EU law blurs this line. One can also envision a Member State raising concerns about the fairness of hearings, even when some have taken place (as in the cases of Poland and Hungary). (Update: the Council&amp;rsquo;s internal rules on Article 7 hearings are now available). Lastly, Article 269&amp;rsquo;s time limits require expedited action: challenges must be submitted within one month of the determination (compared to the usual two-month deadline for challenging EU acts), and the Court must issue a ruling within one month (unique in EU law).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While Article 7 hasn&amp;rsquo;t resulted in sanctions yet, questions regarding its scope might arise soon. Hungary is challenging the European Parliament&amp;rsquo;s decision to trigger Article 7. This challenge might be inadmissible, as typically, only adopted legal acts can be challenged, not the initiation of procedures. This could explain why Article 269 TFEU doesn&amp;rsquo;t address challenging European Parliament actions (or those of the Commission or Member States). The Hungarian government argues that the European Parliament incorrectly disregarded abstentions when counting votes to trigger Article 7.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Interpreting the unanimity requirement for issuing a &amp;ldquo;red card&amp;rdquo; determination presents a crucial legal and political question. Some argue that with two Member States facing Article 7 procedures, their tendency to support each other would make unanimity impossible. They propose that for the &amp;ldquo;red card&amp;rdquo; process to function effectively, any Member State facing Article 7 should lose its vote even when issuing a &amp;ldquo;red card&amp;rdquo; against another Member State.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, this interpretation is flawed. Article 354 TFEU clearly states that &amp;ldquo;the Member State in question&amp;rdquo; loses voting rights in its own case, using both the singular and definite article. This cannot be stretched to encompass multiple Member States. Such interpretations, particularly when seeking to ensure the rule of law within the EU, are inappropriate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Conclusions&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At 20 years old, Article 7 TEU, envisioned as a political tool, remains inherently so despite attempts to utilize it. Its impact on national sovereignty and the intricate web of political relationships render it a &amp;ldquo;nuclear option&amp;rdquo; – reserved for extreme situations like military coups. While the 2003 &amp;ldquo;yellow card&amp;rdquo; reform aimed to introduce nuance, it&amp;rsquo;s still perceived as a drastic measure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The primary issue, which the &amp;ldquo;yellow card&amp;rdquo; reform failed to address, is that democratic erosion rarely happens overnight. As the saying goes, &amp;ldquo;fascism arrives as your friend&amp;rdquo; – promising to restore honor, instill pride, protect homes, provide jobs, improve safety, evoke past glories, eliminate corruption, and remove anything perceived as different.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thus, it often gains ground through democratic processes. Yet, the EU values to be protected include democracy itself, and the Article 7 process rests in the hands of fellow Member States, each with their own flaws and potential biases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Is Article 7 doomed to fail? The expansion of EU law into areas relevant to human rights and the CJEU&amp;rsquo;s willingness to address judicial independence in national courts suggest the &amp;ldquo;nuclear option&amp;rdquo; might not be necessary. The fight for human rights and the rule of law within Member States can be waged through conventional means: the standard system of enforcing EU law, which we will explore in the next post. The broader tension arising from concerns about the rule of law and human rights stemming from democratic outcomes will be analyzed in the third post.&lt;/p>

It was part of the ISM band - Industrial, Scientific, and Medical - a section of the radio spectrum designated for devices that unintentionally emit radiation as a byproduct of their operation. These bands, ranging from 6.78 MHz to 245 GHz, were meant for devices like microwave ovens, industrial heaters, and medical equipment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The 2.4 GHz band, specifically the range of 2.4 to 2.5 GHz, is shared by devices like microwave ovens and 802.11b/g WiFi. This might seem problematic, but the ISM bands were not originally set up for licensed, intentional transmission. The emissions from ISM devices were considered a necessary side effect.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, in 1985, the FCC opened these bands for intentional use, allowing technologies like cordless phones, wireless networking, and even video transmission to operate without a license. This decision came with a few caveats: a power limit of 4 watts and a &amp;ldquo;no complaints&amp;rdquo; policy regarding interference. If a microwave oven disrupts your WiFi, it&amp;rsquo;s simply an unavoidable consequence of using this unlicensed spectrum.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You might wonder why anyone would choose to use these interference-prone frequencies. The answer is the appeal of license-free operation and sufficient power for various wireless technologies. The limited range of these signals, combined with interference-resistant modulation techniques like DSSS, FHSS, and OFDM, makes sharing the spectrum feasible. These techniques are employed in various technologies, including cordless phones, WiFi (802.11b, a, g), Bluetooth, and WiMAX, allowing them to function effectively within the ISM bands.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 Type 5513: Some Cabinet Work</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-some-cabinet-work/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2024 16:52:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-some-cabinet-work/</guid><description>&lt;p>Over the weekend, I made progress reassembling the Beogram 4002, focusing on the cabinet trim and deck cover. To prevent damage, I had previously removed the rosewood trim.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The trim is attached to a metal frame that slides in and out to lock and unlock the cabinet. This frame relies on five guide washers, which are commonly broken in Beogram 4002 units. This one was no different. These washers have a unique design, as detailed in a past Beolover blog post.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This Beogram now has replacements for these washers, thanks to 3D printed versions from Beolover.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While it might seem possible to use standard flat washers as substitutes, the specially designed printed parts are essential for correctly assembling the Beogram cabinet. As explained in the Beolover blog post, these washers act as guides for the cabinet locking frame to slide smoothly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While attaching the cabinet trim and lock, I discovered the frame was separating from the rosewood along the front.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiii4loT-3N7KR7IONlkUutyXjURF7m9ycyk4A_1RB6yWxF7TfgRcH6CY2fQMI4SC0oq0_o9Nf4JPLt6uLtJipVfvHwITOF3L4gWrLF_JBzF7QGhpRL0qLUdu5rcLSDCbYbDOsKf15lkIM/s1600/beogram_8000_cabinet_repair_001.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This separation needed to be fixed with epoxy before I could proceed. Gluing it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a good option due to the risk of mess and potential damage. To work on it safely, I carefully removed the trim piece. To protect the rosewood finish, I covered it with painter&amp;rsquo;s tape, preventing scratches or glue residue. The picture shows the areas prepared for the epoxy.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>For this repair, I opted for slow-drying epoxy, which allows ample time for cleanup and adjustments. I let it dry overnight.&lt;/p>

While getting a fraction of a T1 line&amp;rsquo;s capacity seemed like a good idea for those who didn&amp;rsquo;t need the full 1.5 Mbps, the cost savings weren&amp;rsquo;t as significant as one might expect.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The issue is that the infrastructure for a T1 line, the &amp;ldquo;pipe,&amp;rdquo; has a fixed capacity regardless of actual usage. Even if you only use a fraction of the bandwidth, the underlying cost remains largely the same. Although fractional T1 lines were offered, they were often priced disproportionately to the actual bandwidth used.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nowadays, getting fractional speeds can be more expensive than a full T1 line due to the specialized engineering required. It&amp;rsquo;s sometimes more cost-effective to order the full T1 and not utilize its entire capacity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Traditional telecom services lack scalability, offering large jumps between service levels. A newer technology, Carrier Ethernet (also known as Metro Ethernet), addresses this limitation with its high scalability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Carrier Ethernet offers standard network speeds like 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, and 1000 Mbps, but also provides a wide range of bandwidth options in between. The key is to have a port that can handle your maximum expected speed, allowing you to easily upgrade bandwidth later with a simple phone call to your provider.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To avoid paying for unused capacity, compare pricing for fractional T1, DS3, and OC3 services with Ethernet over Copper and Ethernet over Fiber. Since prices depend on location, request a specific quote for your business address.&lt;/p>

While traditional solutions like private lines and Frame Relay have their merits, a newer method is gaining traction, especially for businesses with numerous sites.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Private lines offer unparalleled reliability, consistent bandwidth, and robust security due to their dedicated nature. They are well-suited for connecting phone systems or transmitting video between locations. However, the need for a separate line between each pair of sites makes them expensive, particularly as the network expands.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many businesses prefer a mesh network where all locations connect to a central network &amp;ldquo;cloud,&amp;rdquo; enabling communication between any two points. Frame Relay, private IP, and MPLS networks offer this, but a more cost-effective solution exists: the internet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While not as reliable or predictable as private networks, the internet&amp;rsquo;s widespread availability and affordability make it an attractive option for inter-site connectivity. Its limitations can be overcome, making it suitable for applications like email, point of sale transactions, data updates, and e-commerce. The TCP/IP protocol ensures reliable data transfer even with occasional slowdowns or minor data loss.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Security concerns are addressed through encryption, creating a &amp;ldquo;tunnel&amp;rdquo; for private data transmission over the public internet. This forms a virtual private network (VPN), combining aspects of both private and public networks. Various standardized methods like IPsec, PPTP, and SSL are available for establishing VPNs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Businesses can implement their own VPNs or utilize managed solutions where a provider oversees routers and security software. With high-speed internet connections becoming increasingly affordable, now might be an opportune time to implement a new VPN or upgrade existing systems for faster speeds and potentially lower costs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For guidance on choosing the best solution for your needs, whether connecting a handful or thousands of locations, our team of expert consultants is here to help.

Upgrading bandwidth seems like the obvious solution, but it&amp;rsquo;s costly, especially since guests expect free Wi-Fi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While it seems logical that faster internet costs more, that&amp;rsquo;s not always true. Hotels can sometimes secure better internet speeds for less money. This depends on where they get their internet service and the age of their contracts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The internet landscape has changed rapidly. Many hotels signed contracts for wireless internet years ago when options were limited and technology was different. These contracts may be outdated and more expensive than current offerings. Just like phone lines, competition in the internet service market has increased, leading to better prices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many hotels aren&amp;rsquo;t equipped to navigate the complexities of telecom contracts. They might rely on technology vendors who may not be getting them the best deals. Instead of going through vendors, hotels can work with specialized telecom brokers. These brokers can identify competing internet providers in their area and find the best offers, saving hotels money.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Technology has also advanced. Options like Carrier Ethernet and bonded T1 lines offer attractive pricing and higher bandwidth. Increased competition and advanced search tools make finding affordable broadband services easier than ever. Hotels can likely find better internet service for a lower price than they are currently paying.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>ClientEarth v Council: A significant win for transparency in accessing documents.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/clientearth-v-council-a-significant-win-for-transparency-in-accessing-documents/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jul 2024 17:52:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/clientearth-v-council-a-significant-win-for-transparency-in-accessing-documents/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiTTAEaZy2KCVXBQM_HaflPAkPW5RO0mdjYCEl57q1rjydbATbiD6kP4XqOyObBWu6dcP908ACnEP1KXgRVtl4-GdV41-of8dPi82WxbhQ3_ZWM89lLngC7XaZiYxLnEg03zp26I2zs3VILoqYcLRnjC1TYAYBZlILXIdZtBPoDMFsIcLTpLQkEGLToQP8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>In the combined cases of &lt;em>ClientEarth v Council&lt;/em> (T-682/21 and T-683/21), the General Court of the European Union (GC) reviewed a challenge brought by ClientEarth AISBL and Ms. Leino-Sandberg against the Council of the EU. The applicants sought to overturn the Council&amp;rsquo;s decision to withhold access to documents they had requested under the Public Access to Documents Regulation and the Aarhus Convention Regulation. The GC ruled in favor of ClientEarth, annulling the Council&amp;rsquo;s decision to restrict access.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This ruling carries significant implications. First, it clarifies the transparency obligations of EU institutions. Second, it promotes openness in EU lawmaking. Lastly, it reinforces the standards for justifying EU decisions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This analysis will first outline the background of the case and the legal arguments presented. It will then examine the GC’s key judgments before concluding with an assessment of the ruling’s broader impact.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Background of the Case and Legal Arguments&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ClientEarth AISBL and Ms. Päivi Leino-Sandberg filed actions for annulment under Article 263 TFEU. They sought to overturn the decisions, documented in Council letters SGS 21/2869 and SGS 21/2870 dated August 9, 2021, which partially denied access to document 8721/21. This document, issued by the Council&amp;rsquo;s legal service, contained its legal evaluation of the proposed amendment to the EU Aarhus Regulation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Aarhus Regulation, enacted in 2006, aimed to align the EU with the Aarhus Convention, which guarantees public access to information, participation in decision-making, and access to justice on environmental issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 2017, the Aarhus Convention Compliance Committee (Aarhus Committee) identified that the EU was not fully compliant with the Convention regarding public access to justice. It recommended amending the EU Aarhus Regulation to broaden its scope beyond individual acts and include all acts contradicting environmental law and to grant access to the public beyond specific NGOs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following a proposal from the European Commission in 2020 to amend the Aarhus Regulation and subsequent advice from the Aarhus Committee, the Council’s legal service drafted an opinion on the proposal in May 2021, documented as 8721/21. ClientEarth requested full access, but the Council only granted access to certain sections. ClientEarth filed confirmatory applications, and the Council, in its contested August 2021 decisions, granted access to additional paragraphs but maintained its refusal for full disclosure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ClientEarth presented four pleas in law, arguing that the Council committed legal errors and a manifest error of assessment. The first three pleas focused on legal errors, while the fourth served as a subsidiary plea. This analysis will prioritize the second plea, followed by the first and third, focusing solely on the key legal arguments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Second Plea in Law (paras 26-87)&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ClientEarth’s second plea alleged that the Council erred in applying the exception under Article 4(2) of Regulation No 1049/2001, concerning the protection of legal advice. This provision allows withholding document access if disclosure compromises legal advice, unless outweighed by public interest. A three-part test is established in case law to implement this exception.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, the institution (in this case, the Council) must determine if the requested document contains legal advice, and if so, identify the specific sections applicable to the exception. Second, the institution must assess if disclosing those sections would undermine the protection of legal advice. The crucial question here is whether it would be detrimental to the institution’s ability to seek and receive unbiased and comprehensive legal advice. Any risk of undermining this interest must be realistically probable and not merely theoretical. Finally, even if disclosure is deemed potentially harmful to legal advice, the institution must determine if an overriding public interest justifies disclosure despite potential risks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Addressing these conditions sequentially, the applicants first contested whether the opinion even qualified as legal advice, a claim quickly dismissed by the GC, which affirmed that the document&amp;rsquo;s content addressed legal questions and thus fell under the legal advice exception (para 42).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Moving to the second condition, the applicants contended that the document lacked sensitivity and scope, implying the Council erred in assessing that disclosure would undermine legal advice. They argued the Council didn’t prove the existence of an actual, specific, and foreseeable risk associated with disclosure, nor did it establish the document&amp;rsquo;s wide scope within its legislative context.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To support the sensitive nature of the document, the Council presented three arguments: the context and content of the document; potential external pressure if released; and the possibility of related litigation before EU Courts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The GC systematically refuted each defense. It emphasized that the document itself must be sensitive, not merely its context (para 58). If it solely contains legal assessments lacking novelty, sensitive information, or confidential facts, it cannot be classified as sensitive (para 59), contradicting the Council’s position.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Court then addressed the Council’s argument that disclosure would subject its legal service to external pressure, potentially influencing future advice and hindering unbiased opinions. The GC rejected this abstract concern. It highlighted established case law emphasizing that transparency in EU legislative processes enhances institutional legitimacy and public trust by enabling open debate on differing viewpoints (para 64). Therefore, citing a generic “external pressure” risk was insufficient to prove a threat to legal advice protection, leading to the rejection of this argument.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Regarding the sensitivity of the document due to potential litigation before EU Courts, the GC remained unconvinced. The Council argued that publishing an initially negative opinion on a legislative draft would hinder its defense of that act&amp;rsquo;s legality in court. While this appears plausible, the GC reminded the Council that such a general argument does not justify an exception to the transparency principle of Regulation No 1049/2001 (para 74). The Council failed to specify how disclosure would harm its defense in potential litigation regarding the Aarhus Regulation&amp;rsquo;s interpretation or application. Furthermore, the document&amp;rsquo;s content did not demonstrably express a negative stance on the Commission’s proposed amendment. Concluding this point, the GC stated that the Council&amp;rsquo;s refusal demonstrated an error of assessment, thereby upholding the applicants&amp;rsquo; first complaint (para 76).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Shifting to the applicants’ second complaint, which contested the Council’s claim of the document’s wide scope, the Council presented two arguments. Firstly, aligning the Aarhus Regulation’s internal review mechanism with acts contradicting environmental law, as proposed by the Commission, mirrored standing limitations under Article 263 TFEU. The Council argued that the document&amp;rsquo;s analysis had broader implications than the specific legislative process. Secondly, the document allegedly touched upon issues influencing the Commission’s future legislative proposals within the &amp;ldquo;European Green Deal&amp;rdquo; framework.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The GC countered by stating that the Council merely alluded to the document&amp;rsquo;s potential influence on future environmental legislation, while the Commission’s proposal for amending the Aarhus Regulation remained specific to those matters (para 82). The GC also logically dismantled the analogy with Article 263 TFEU, stating that the Council didn&amp;rsquo;t demonstrate how the Commission&amp;rsquo;s proposal on the Aarhus Regulation impacted the admissibility of annulment actions filed by individuals or legal entities, governed by Article 263 TFEU and only amendable through Treaty revisions (para 84). The GC upheld the second complaint, along with the entirety of the applicant&amp;rsquo;s second plea in law (para 87), and proceeded to examine the first plea.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>First Plea in Law (paras 88-103)&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ClientEarth’s first plea asserted that the Council erred in applying the exception provided in Article 4(3) of Regulation No 1049/2001, pertaining to the protection of the decision-making process. This provision allows institutions to refuse access to internal documents concerning ongoing decision-making processes if disclosure would significantly undermine those processes, barring an overriding public interest in disclosure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The applicants argued that because the Council had already adopted its position on the Commission&amp;rsquo;s proposal and reached a provisional agreement when the contested decisions were made, there was no active decision-making process that disclosure could jeopardize.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The GC clarified the rationale behind this provision: to ensure institutions have space for deliberation to determine policy choices and potential proposals (para 93). However, this provision becomes inapplicable to procedures already concluded when the access request was made (para 96). The GC pragmatically acknowledged that agreements reached during trilogues are typically adopted by co-legislators without major modifications. Therefore, the decision-making process involving the requested document was deemed closed when the Council endorsed the provisional agreement (para 99), rendering the Council&amp;rsquo;s reliance on this provision to refuse disclosure a legal error (para 101).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Third Plea in Law (paras 104-120)&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The applicants&amp;rsquo; third and final plea argued that the Council erred in applying the exception under Article 4(1)(a) of Regulation No 1049/2001, concerning the protection of the public interest regarding international relations. The applicants maintained that disclosing the legal document posed no risk to international relations and deemed the exception inapplicable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To justify invoking this exception, the Council argued that full disclosure would expose considerations regarding the “legal viability of solutions for addressing the EU’s alleged non-compliance with the Aarhus Convention.&amp;quot; The Council stressed that the risk to the public interest, particularly international relations, was foreseeable, as the Aarhus Convention compliance issue was scheduled for discussion at an upcoming meeting of involved parties in 2021. They argued that other parties could leverage the requested document during the meeting, potentially weakening the European Union’s position.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The GC maintained its stringent approach to such claims, noting that simply linking a document&amp;rsquo;s content to the EU&amp;rsquo;s objectives in international agreements does not automatically justify withholding access on the grounds of protecting international relations (para 112). More importantly, the GC stated that enacting secondary EU legislation naturally involves legal analyses from each participating institution, potentially leading to diverging legal interpretations. However, such divergences are inherent to any legislative process and can be addressed in international forums without necessarily compromising the EU&amp;rsquo;s stance on the final adopted act (para 114). Consequently, the Council failed to provide concrete, specific, and plausible evidence of a risk to the EU’s international relations concerning other parties involved in the Aarhus Convention (para 118).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The GC deemed it unnecessary to examine the applicants&amp;rsquo; fourth and subsidiary plea, alleging an infringement of Article 4(6) of Regulation No 1049/2001 concerning the Council&amp;rsquo;s failure to grant broader access, as the annulment of the decisions was already established (para 120).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Broader Implications and Conclusion&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The GC&amp;rsquo;s thorough and well-reasoned ruling holds significance for several reasons. It clarifies the conditions for legitimately refusing document access and emphasizes that any &amp;ldquo;risk&amp;rdquo; cited by EU institutions to justify refusal must be concrete, actual, foreseeable, and not merely hypothetical. Additionally, it demonstrates the EU Courts&amp;rsquo; pragmatic understanding of EU lawmaking processes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most crucially, this ruling underscores a significant principle: even in high-stakes political situations, EU Courts prioritize transparency. The sentiment “sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants,” once articulated by Justice Brandeis in the context of the US Supreme Court, resonates with this ruling in Luxembourg.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Great Repeal Bill and the Legacy of Henry VIII: Threatening Rights</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-great-repeal-bill-and-the-legacy-of-henry-viii-threatening-rights/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jul 2024 17:13:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-great-repeal-bill-and-the-legacy-of-henry-viii-threatening-rights/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg7R2Ghyphenhyphen2zYD46YRvr32IXJ2Uu_rbBNJScofrSXZ62U8KxjVx02PW31RccjS_PEF5fP1EW9hbODkoFwoBT4MFFE4lnv1ZEzD-gIk7TtzmFePDcP_tCRIQr4eMKl_TrhNigYMg6Fq7TbmpQ/s1600/Hans_Holbein_Henry_VIII.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>The Great Repeal Bill is ironically named because it won&amp;rsquo;t actually repeal much EU law. Instead, when Brexit concludes, it will initially shift existing EU law into British law. While this maintains some stability during the transition, the bill also includes a concerning element: a Henry VIII clause. This clause, named after the king who gave himself sweeping legislative power, allows the government to alter primary legislation with minimal parliamentary scrutiny. While this might seem practical for managing the vast body of EU law, it raises concerns about democratic oversight.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The inclusion of a Henry VIII clause in the Great Repeal Bill has significant implications for human rights. It could potentially allow a government minister, rather than Parliament, to decide the fate of rights derived from EU law. This article examines the historical context and criticisms of Henry VIII clauses and explores their potential impact on rights using the metaphor of King Henry VIII&amp;rsquo;s six wives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Ghost of Henry VIII&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Henry VIII clauses are controversial because they prioritize efficiency over parliamentary scrutiny, a practice deemed unacceptable even in the 16th century. While these clauses have been used in specific, limited circumstances, they contradict the principles of democracy and parliamentary supremacy. The sheer volume of EU law subject to change under the Great Repeal Bill magnifies these concerns. Granting ministers unchecked power to amend laws derived from EU norms could lead to unintended consequences and legal uncertainty.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The irony is that Brexit, despite promises of returning power to Parliament, relies on mechanisms that centralize power in the executive branch. The use of a Henry VIII clause and the debate over who can trigger Article 50 both highlight this tension between executive power and parliamentary sovereignty. This approach to Brexit echoes the autocratic tendencies of Henry VIII beyond just the namesake clause.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The (Possible) Fates of Fundamental Rights&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The potential impact of the Great Repeal Bill and its Henry VIII clause on fundamental rights can be illustrated using the fates of Henry VIII&amp;rsquo;s wives: divorce, beheaded, died, divorce, beheaded, survived.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The right to appeal to EU institutions will be &lt;strong>beheaded&lt;/strong> by Brexit. Citizens will lose the ability to seek redress from the EU Commission or Court of Justice, leaving them reliant on domestic courts and existing human rights laws. This is linked to the &lt;strong>death&lt;/strong> of rights directly stemming from EU treaties, such as free movement and citizenship rights. Additionally, the robust protections of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights will no longer apply in the UK.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The separation of UK and EU legal systems creates uncertainty. The interpretation of laws originating from EU law becomes unclear, as does the precedence of future EU court judgments. Further, rights currently protected by EU law but replicable in UK law, such as consumer and worker rights, could be &lt;strong>beheaded&lt;/strong>, intentionally or accidentally, by ministerial decree under the Henry VIII clause.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One potential &lt;strong>survivor&lt;/strong> is the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which operates independently of EU membership. However, the ECHR may struggle to adequately fill the gap left by the loss of EU rights. Other surviving rights will be those already safeguarded by common law.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ultimately, the legacy of the Great Repeal Bill and its Henry VIII clause will likely be a net loss of rights. The decades-long trend of strengthening fundamental rights is under threat. The current climate suggests that we may face consequences far more significant than just the symbolic &amp;ldquo;ghost&amp;rdquo; of Henry VIII.&lt;/p>

This diagram, Circuit Diagram 2, outlines the control system and features a notable difference in the position scale illumination. Instead of the typical two 12V bulbs wired in series, it depicts two 24V bulbs connected in parallel to the 24V power source.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This discovery complicated a recent interaction with Sonavor, who is currently restoring his own Beogram 4000. We both mistakenly assumed his model used the 24V configuration based on my inquiry about providing 12V or 24V LED bulb replacements. Ultimately, his model utilizes the standard 12V setup.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nevertheless, I decided to share a high-resolution scan of this unusual 24V circuit diagram with fellow Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen enthusiasts.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The battery is situated directly beneath the TIME CAL indicator on the cabinet. In this instance, the original battery exhibited leakage of the lithium compound, evident as a green-grey substance surrounding it. During the battery removal process, a minor explosion occurred due to the leaked compound reacting with heat. Lithium&amp;rsquo;s high reactivity with oxygen in the presence of heat necessitates caution. Fortunately, protective eyewear prevented any harm. However, it is strongly advised to sever the battery leads using wire cutters before desoldering to minimize risk. Additionally, cleaning the area with ethanol to remove residual compound is recommended. The image below displays the battery location after cleaning.&lt;/p>

Despite its age, dial-up has significantly improved and remains a viable option for many, even in professional settings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Is dial-up outdated? Not really. Consider how you would access email or websites during a broadband outage. Even the most reliable DSL and cable providers experience occasional disruptions. It&amp;rsquo;s important to remember that broadband often prioritizes convenience over absolute necessity. When necessary, a simple phone line connection to your computer can provide 56K internet access.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not everyone requires constant internet connectivity. Paying $35 to $45 monthly for broadband or $24 for heavily advertised dial-up services is unnecessary for users who only spend an hour per day checking email and browsing websites. For those online 15 hours or less per month, options like CogniSurf at $7.95 a month are available. Alternatively, WorldVerge provides unlimited dial-up access for $9.95 a month.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What does $9.95 a month with WorldVerge entail? It includes unlimited 56K dial-up internet with spam and virus filtering, five email accounts, complimentary 24/7 technical support, and dialers for both PC and Macintosh. For an additional $2.95 per month, an accelerator option can increase email download and website access speeds by up to six times. While not impacting software downloads, website FTPs, or VoIP calls, this enhancement nearly replicates the broadband experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dial-up internet remains a viable and affordable option for various purposes, such as broadband backup, business travel, occasional use, and internet access in areas without DSL or cable coverage.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>While testing the eConnect GetNextNumber methods in Integration Manager, I encountered an error. My simple GL transaction import, using the eConnect destination adapter, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t run. After several minutes, I stopped the process, and eventually, an error message appeared indicating a SQL Exception in the GetNextNumber method.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[Image]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My initial troubleshooting, including checking SQL Server for errors, running a SQL Profiler trace, and monitoring SQL Activity, yielded no clues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, I then recalled a setting from the integration setup.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[Image]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Server Name had defaulted to localhost, which I didn&amp;rsquo;t change since IM and SQL Server resided on the same machine. However, my setup utilizes a named SQL Server instance, rendering localhost ineffective.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Changing the Server Name to the correct instance name resolved the issue, allowing the integration to run smoothly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The lack of a timeout or a more descriptive error message from IM, such as &amp;ldquo;Unable to connect to SQL Server,&amp;rdquo; was perplexing. Nonetheless, the solution was straightforward once I identified the root cause.&lt;/p>

This particular motor uses brushes and has simple sleeve bearings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To access the bearings for lubrication, the pulley and outer housing were removed. The pulley is attached to the shaft with glue, allowing for easy removal. After taking out two small screws, the housing can be opened and the motor taken out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, the black rubber vibration insulation boot was removed, revealing the circuit board connected to the brushes. After noting the position of the bottom part, three screws were removed to detach it and the brush plate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The bottom bearing was lubricated by applying a small amount of silicone grease into the bottom sleeve located below the brushes. The top bearing was greased by applying a bit to the shaft and moving it up and down within the bearing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The motor was then reassembled, using the slanted plastic disc on the commutator to guide the brushes into place during reassembly. Following the disassembly steps in reverse, the motor was placed back into the outer housing. Finally, the pulley was reattached to the shaft using superglue gel.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Cosmetic Items, Final Adjustments, and a Test Drive with George Duke on MPS!</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-cosmetic-items-final-adjustments-and-a-test-drive-with-george-duke-on-mps-/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jul 2024 13:18:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-cosmetic-items-final-adjustments-and-a-test-drive-with-george-duke-on-mps-/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Beogram 4000 restoration project, originating from Germany, is nearing completion. After adjusting the sub-chassis and arm height, I set the arm lowering limit, a crucial measure to protect the stylus from potential damage if the record detection fails.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, I calibrated the tracking weight, opting to enhance stability by replacing the original locking washer setup with an M3 nut and washer to secure the counterweight position.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following that, I calibrated the arm weight using a digital scale and fine-tuned the feedback by adjusting the tracking sensor LED with a blue potentiometer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The final adjustment involved setting the motor voltage, confirmed by achieving smooth sine curves on the oscilloscope for both 33 and 45 RPM.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To complete the restoration, I replaced the damaged main aluminum platter and arm cover with pristine parts from a 4002 5501 Beogram and a donor 4004, respectively. I specifically sought an early 4002 arm cover to match the 4000&amp;rsquo;s aesthetic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, I tested the restored Beogram 4000 with a George Duke record, &amp;ldquo;Liberated Fantasies,&amp;rdquo; a personal favorite from the MPS label.

While it flips open and closed conventionally, the display also rotates 90 degrees, allowing you to view the screen while looking at the phone&amp;rsquo;s side. This unique feature accommodates the powerful 2 Megapixel camera positioned in the hinge area, shooting sideways. By swiveling the screen, you transform your phone into a compact camcorder capable of recording and sending video clips with sound in addition to capturing still photos.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The A940&amp;rsquo;s large screen, measuring 176 x 220 pixels and displaying over 262,000 colors, complements the high-resolution camera. A smaller external color display provides essential information when the phone is closed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>True to its &amp;ldquo;MM&amp;rdquo; (multi-media) designation, the A940 goes beyond video capabilities to offer a built-in MP3 player with stereo sound. An expandable memory card slot enables you to store your music and video collection.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The MM-A940 is also recognized as the EVDO-940. This designation signifies its compatibility with EVDO, a high-speed 3G (third-generation) network being deployed by Sprint across the United States. EVDO essentially delivers cellular broadband, allowing users in covered areas to enjoy on-demand TV video clips or music streaming with the optional Sprint PCS Vision Ultimate Pack.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hands-free convenience is a hallmark of the Samsung MM-A940. Advanced voice-activated dialing facilitates calling contacts simply by speaking their names, eliminating the need for voice training. The speakerphone function enables hands-free conversations, while a Bluetooth headset option allows for private calls without the constraints of wires.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>David The Good&amp;rsquo;s latest book, &lt;em>Push The Zone&lt;/em>, is out now on Amazon. I finished reading it this morning and really enjoyed it (&lt;a class="link" href="http://amzn.to/2kygGSb" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Click Here&lt;/a> for details).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The book&amp;rsquo;s introduction provides a solid overview, which I&amp;rsquo;ll summarize in the following paragraphs:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This book won&amp;rsquo;t perform miracles, such as teaching you to cultivate limes in Minnesota or cocoa in Manhattan. It also won&amp;rsquo;t help with your dating life, but you probably already knew that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 11.0px Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000} p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 11.0px Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000; min-height: 13.0px} span.s1 {font-kerning: none}&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What this book &lt;em>will&lt;/em> do is expand your gardening horizons. If you live a few hundred miles away from a climate where your desired plants thrive, the techniques within might help you cultivate them in your own backyard, much to your neighbors&amp;rsquo; astonishment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I reside in New York State, where the climate is far too cold to grow tropical plants outdoors. Despite this, many of the core principles in &lt;em>Push The Zone&lt;/em>, particularly those about microclimates, can be applied to my 4b-5a USDA Hardiness Zone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Peaches, for instance, struggle in my zone due to the cold. However, a few hundred miles south in Pennsylvania&amp;rsquo;s zone 6 regions, peaches flourish. &lt;em>Push The Zone&lt;/em> has given me the confidence to attempt growing a peach tree by utilizing microclimates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Admittedly, this book is geared towards gardeners in warmer U.S. regions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What distinguishes &lt;em>Push The Zone&lt;/em> is its engaging storytelling approach. The book is rich with practical advice conveyed through captivating narratives of David&amp;rsquo;s personal zone-pushing experiments and the experiences of other gardeners he&amp;rsquo;s encountered. These stories make the information both memorable and enjoyable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>David&amp;rsquo;s writing style is concise, witty, and impactful. While entertaining, the lessons are presented with seriousness and depth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having read four of David&amp;rsquo;s six books, I believe &lt;em>Push The Zone&lt;/em> could be his best work yet.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Chris Nash, the Director of the European Network on Statelessness, highlights their recent analysis of the EU Pact on Migration and Asylum. The analysis focuses on how the European Commission&amp;rsquo;s proposals within the Pact could affect the fundamental rights of stateless migrants and refugees. It offers suggestions for addressing these concerns during Pact negotiations and implementation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Pact, as it stands, fails to directly address the rights of stateless individuals or offer solutions to the specific protection issues they encounter. This omission is not entirely unexpected, as the existing EU asylum and migration framework also lacks provisions for the rights of stateless persons under international law. This oversight persists despite previous European Council Conclusions on Statelessness and research demonstrating the significant impact statelessness has on migration experiences.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Available data indicates that over 3% of asylum seekers in the EU are registered as stateless or of undetermined nationality, a figure likely underestimated due to inadequate identification and documentation processes at European borders. The lack of a clear system for registering statelessness upon arrival results in stateless refugees and migrants being inaccurately assigned nationalities based on origin or language. This further marginalizes individuals from countries grappling with discriminatory laws, state succession issues, nationality stripping, or prolonged displacement, rendering them statistically invisible. These circumstances impact not only asylum decisions but also family reunification, resettlement, social inclusion, and repatriation prospects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Aligning EU asylum and migration laws necessitates better identification and documentation of statelessness, along with appropriate determination procedures, protection access, and measures that support integration. These steps are crucial in breaking the cycle of criminalization, detention, and enforced poverty that many stateless people in Europe experience. Essentially, ensuring the realization of rights already guaranteed to stateless individuals, including children, under international law is paramount.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recommendations include incorporating a clear reference to the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons and its definition within the Pact. Additionally, screening and recording &amp;ldquo;initial indications of statelessness&amp;rdquo; at borders and referring individuals to suitable determination procedures, including dedicated Statelessness Determination Procedures (SDPs), are crucial. Improving data collection on statelessness within EU databases, especially the proposed revised Eurodac Proposal, is also vital. Given that stateless individuals often lack a country of return, exemptions from return sponsorships are urged. This ensures that statelessness-related return barriers are acknowledged and individuals are referred to SDPs during return procedures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Pact&amp;rsquo;s proposal to amend the Long-Term Residence Directive to reduce the waiting period for long-term residence status to three years for beneficiaries of international protection is welcomed. Explicitly including beneficiaries of protection under the 1954 Convention (&amp;ldquo;stateless status&amp;rdquo;) in this amendment is strongly recommended.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Integrating statelessness considerations into the Migration Preparedness and Crisis Network and including a dedicated section on statelessness in the Commission&amp;rsquo;s Migration Management Reports are essential for coordinated data collection and information sharing. Building on EASO&amp;rsquo;s recent attention to statelessness, mainstreaming it across the work of the new EU Asylum Agency is critical. The draft Pact&amp;rsquo;s emphasis on monitoring should include guidance on fundamental rights monitoring that incorporates the rights of stateless persons under international law.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Addressing misconceptions regarding relevance or competency that hinder progress is crucial. While concerted efforts from states are needed to uphold international obligations, facilitate naturalization, and prevent statelessness, the EU must also take action. The EU lags behind in global efforts to eradicate statelessness and must harmonize its approach to stateless refugees and migrants to maintain its standing in upholding the rule of law and human rights. Centering stateless people and affected communities in these endeavors is non-negotiable. The European Pact on Migration and Asylum presents a timely and critical opportunity to make this a reality.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some Brexit supporters have a relaxed view of European Union (EU) law. However, their assertions about trade after Brexit, specifically the notion that existing agreements would simply continue, require closer examination. They argue that global trade regulations would prevent the EU from hindering the UK&amp;rsquo;s trade relationships. This overlooks the possibility that, absent a transitional agreement, the UK&amp;rsquo;s participation in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and other trade agreements could be at risk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since the late 1960s, the EU has progressively taken control over international trade matters, termed the &amp;ldquo;common commercial policy.&amp;rdquo; This doesn&amp;rsquo;t include individual transactions like selling British trains to India; that remains under each member state&amp;rsquo;s authority. Instead, it covers policies like import taxes (tariffs) and regulations that could impact trade.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This exclusive EU trade power exists for practical reasons, not as an overreach. The EU functions as a customs union under WTO rules. Unlike the North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA), customs union members can&amp;rsquo;t set individual tariffs or make separate trade deals. Once a product has paid the common tariff, it moves freely within the Union. Individual tariffs would necessitate customs checks, contradicting the free movement of goods within the single market. The UK government&amp;rsquo;s own assessment concluded that more control over trade with other nations means sacrificing benefits within the EU&amp;rsquo;s single market.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>International Law Doesn&amp;rsquo;t Guarantee Free Trade&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Free trade isn&amp;rsquo;t a given right in international law. Agreements like the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the WTO are necessary because engaging in trade is a sovereign decision for each country. While there are economic advantages, states have opted out of international trade before. The pro-Brexit campaign stresses the economic incentive for UK trade partners to reach agreements but downplays the same incentives for the EU. This is contradictory: if the UK can make ideological decisions about EU membership, other countries can do the same regarding trade with a post-Brexit UK. The idea that French farmers would demand a free trade deal with the UK ignores their stance on free trade in general.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>EU Membership Benefits Trade with Non-EU Countries&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Negotiating new global trade deals within the WTO has been slow, leading many countries and the EU to pursue bilateral or smaller multilateral deals. The EU has concluded agreements with around 50 nations and is negotiating more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While the UK might strike more deals outside the EU, two issues arise. First, these agreements are complex if the UK wants to preserve systems like the NHS and public education, which other countries might seek to liberalize. Second, as seen with the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), such deals take time and face opposition. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between the EU and the USA would likely be a mixed agreement, requiring UK ratification and giving it veto power. If the UK left the EU, it would lose the bargaining power the EU has in such negotiations. The USA would likely demand similar, if not more, concessions from a post-Brexit UK in any trade deal. This assumes the US is even willing to negotiate, which officials have denied. This also undermines the argument that Brexit would avoid the &amp;lsquo;unfavorable&amp;rsquo; TTIP. The pressure on the UK to quickly reach a trade deal would be immense, potentially putting sensitive sectors, especially services, on the table for liberalization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Brexit would mean certain international agreements exclusive to the EU would no longer apply to the UK. This has significant implications, particularly for Scotland. For instance, &amp;ldquo;Scotch whisky&amp;rdquo; is a protected name under an EU-Canada agreement, to which no individual EU members are party. More importantly, a similar agreement exists with the USA, the top market for Scotch whisky. The EU-South Africa agreement covers another crucial market. Jeopardizing these agreements by leaving the EU would be detrimental.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>WTO Membership&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The EU is a founding WTO member (established January 1, 1995). It nearly replaced individual member state membership, but a court ruling determined that the WTO Agreement and related agreements are mixed. This means both the EU and its member states share competence. The claim that the EU merely represents its members, as in other international bodies, is incorrect, ignoring the EU&amp;rsquo;s exclusive competence over trade. Lord Lawson&amp;rsquo;s assertion that UK trade relations would stay the same is simply wrong. He inadvertently revealed another uncertainty: Brexit could force the UK to renegotiate its WTO membership terms. This is not a simple treaty succession issue, as both the UK and the EU retain their legal personalities post-Brexit. It&amp;rsquo;s unlike Scotland&amp;rsquo;s situation because Scotland isn&amp;rsquo;t directly party to international treaties.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Experts have pointed out that if the UK leaves the EU&amp;rsquo;s customs union, it would need to submit new tariff schedules to the WTO for continued membership. These need consensus from all WTO members, which could be complicated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While continued UK WTO membership is likely, it would require extensive renegotiations of its tariff commitments. This was challenging even for major economies like Russia and China. Some WTO members might use a &amp;ldquo;non-violation complaint&amp;rdquo; against the UK post-Brexit if they perceive a loss of expected benefits, even without a breach of agreement. This is particularly relevant for service trade (GATS schedules), where pressure from UK trading partners is possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even from a purely international law perspective, renegotiating the UK&amp;rsquo;s WTO membership terms seems unavoidable. Though the UK and the EU both have international legal personality, the UK alone can&amp;rsquo;t fulfill its obligations without the EU&amp;rsquo;s single market. WTO membership requires liberalization commitments based on the free movement of goods within the Union.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Therefore, while continued WTO membership is likely, the UK can&amp;rsquo;t meet all existing obligations on its own. It would need to submit new tariff schedules, even if copied from the EU, potentially leading to further negotiations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Free Trade Agreements&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Contrary to some claims, a disorderly Brexit makes it unlikely for the UK to quickly establish trade agreements with current EU member states. The EU&amp;rsquo;s exclusive trade competence applies even to negotiations between, say, Germany and the UK. Even if German car manufacturers want a trade deal, other EU nations might not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>EU member states can&amp;rsquo;t unilaterally negotiate trade deals within the Union&amp;rsquo;s competence. While the EU would likely desire ongoing trade with the UK, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be automatic. Understanding EU law is crucial here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even the European Economic Area (EEA) agreement, granting access to the single market, is open only to EU and European Free Trade Area (EFTA) states. The UK would have to join EFTA first and then apply to the EEA under the existing treaty. Importantly, EEA members are bound by many EU laws to maintain market access. The EFTA Court has even been more liberal than the EU Court of Justice in some areas, which might not align with Brexit goals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This means that if the EU wished to complicate trade with the UK, it could. While economically unwise, recent EU political decisions haven&amp;rsquo;t always followed economic logic. The notion that French farmers would readily push for a UK trade deal is unrealistic, demonstrating a misunderstanding of French politics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even in agreements where both the UK and EU are parties, like the WTO or most existing EU Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), the UK&amp;rsquo;s trade relations are likely to change. It&amp;rsquo;s arguable that these &amp;ldquo;mixed agreements&amp;rdquo; could automatically terminate for the UK after Brexit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One legal justification is the definition of &amp;ldquo;parties&amp;rdquo; within the agreements. Some FTAs define parties as EU member states, making the UK&amp;rsquo;s continued participation questionable. Additionally, territorial scope clauses, like in the EU-Central America agreement, link application to where EU treaties apply, potentially excluding the UK. Ultimately, the non-EU country has the right to end its UK trade relationship. Therefore, while the UK is currently a party to these agreements, its rights and obligations wouldn&amp;rsquo;t automatically continue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The EU&amp;rsquo;s current practice of provisionally applying mixed-agreement FTAs for itself, but not its individual members yet to ratify, further complicates matters. The UK benefits from these agreements via EU membership but isn&amp;rsquo;t a direct party until all EU members ratify. This applies to agreements with nations like Peru, Colombia, Central America, Eastern and Southern African states, Cameroon, more Southern African states, and many Caribbean countries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In all FTAs, non-EU countries could request renegotiations with the UK alone or with both the EU and the UK separately. While they might lack economic incentive to renegotiate, doing so amicably would require goodwill and likely UK concessions. While this is the best-case scenario, it still necessitates negotiations and a cooperative approach from all parties.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some suggest the principle of continuity in international law prevents automatic termination or renegotiation. However, this principle, designed for state succession and government changes, doesn&amp;rsquo;t apply here. Since the UK can&amp;rsquo;t fulfill its obligations outside the single market, automatic continuity isn&amp;rsquo;t guaranteed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another relevant concept in international law is &amp;ldquo;fundamentally changed circumstances.&amp;rdquo; Smaller WTO members invoking this would only allow them to leave the WTO, which isn&amp;rsquo;t in their best interest. However, the EU and its remaining members could use this concept to end FTA relationships with the UK outside the WTO context.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most optimistic scenario still requires significant goodwill and likely concessions from the UK. Continuing bilateral trade deals hinges on the EU and the non-EU partner, not just the UK. This contradicts the claim that &amp;ldquo;trade relations with the rest of the world remain unchanged.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>

To determine which candidates best serve your interests, we suggest considering MPLS and Ethernet for reliable bandwidth, improved performance, and reduced costs over 1-3 years. Let&amp;rsquo;s delve into their platforms to see if they deserve your vote.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>IP Networking is currently the leading technology. Initially confined to local offices, IP has expanded to WANs at state, regional, and national levels. Today, almost all network designs are centered around IP or Internet Protocol.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What explains IP&amp;rsquo;s rapid growth? IP, and particularly Ethernet, dominate local area networking, offering high reliability, affordability, and near-universal connectivity. This local success naturally translates to wider adoption in metropolitan and long-haul networks. With a simple RJ45 connector interface, it&amp;rsquo;s no surprise that carriers are incorporating IP core networks into their infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MPLS, or MultiProtocol Label Switching, bridges the gap between older TDM (Time Division Multiplexing) networks with their synchronized channels and newer packet-switching networks. This includes Carrier Ethernet and the Internet, both operating under the IP umbrella.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MPLS brings the advantages of private networking to businesses of all sizes. It seamlessly interconnects diverse locations, offering class-based bandwidth that prioritizes voice, video, and data transmission with minimal latency, jitter, or packet loss. Since the cost of the MPLS cloud is shared among users under the network manager&amp;rsquo;s control, connecting your locations becomes very cost-effective.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>T1 lines, known for their dedicated bandwidth and reliability, often provide access to MPLS networks. Each location connects to the MPLS cloud through its own T1 line, with the cloud handling interconnectivity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ethernet rivals T1 lines when higher bandwidth is required locally or within a metro area. Choose Ethernet for superior performance at speeds of 10, 100, and 1,000 Mbps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MPLS and Ethernet are a powerful combination because they represent progress. They offer higher bandwidth options and lower costs per Mbps compared to older technologies like Frame Relay and SONET. If this aligns with your business needs, consider MPLS Networks and Metro &amp;amp; Carrier Ethernet. These services are available immediately.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sipping on the Trunk Lines</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/sipping-on-the-trunk-lines/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jul 2024 12:36:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/sipping-on-the-trunk-lines/</guid><description>&lt;p>The history of telephone trunks goes back to the early days of telephones. Trunks are lines that carry multiple phone conversations, initially connecting switchboards and switching offices. They&amp;rsquo;ve evolved from wire bundles to analog and now digital circuits, with T1, ISDN PRI, DS3, and SONET being common digital trunking services. However, SIP trunking is emerging as a popular alternative.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Telephone trunking saves money by combining multiple phone lines into a single high-bandwidth connection. T1 lines, including ISDN PRI, become cost-effective when exceeding 10-12 lines. ISDN PRI, a specific T1 type, provides up to 23 lines with Caller ID, making it popular for traditional PBX systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) trunking was designed for VoIP phone systems. SIP is a simple protocol widely used in enterprise VoIP systems. Many modern phones have built-in SIP and VoIP, connecting directly to LANs instead of separate phone networks. An IP PBX on the network manages calls between handsets and external lines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SIP trunking addresses connecting those external lines. While connecting individual lines to an IP PBX for PSTN termination is viable for small setups, SIP trunking offers a more efficient method. Similar to using T1 or ISDN PRI for digital trunking, SIP keeps calls in VoIP packet format, utilizing the same signaling as handsets and IP PBX.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many SIP trunks act as converged voice and data connections to providers, carrying internet traffic alongside calls. Voice is prioritized for quality, while remaining bandwidth serves internet needs. Call termination to the PSTN happens at the provider, who leverages bulk services for potential cost savings. On-network calls, even to other companies on the same service, may be free.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If SIP trunking seems beneficial for your business VoIP system, explore potential savings by checking out competitive SIP trunking phone services.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Samsung D307 is Built For Messaging</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/samsung-d307-is-built-for-messaging/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jul 2024 08:11:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/samsung-d307-is-built-for-messaging/</guid><description>&lt;p>We apologize, but the Samsung D307 is no longer available. To explore the latest cell phone deals and free phone offers, use our convenient &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.cellphoneplanfinder.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Cell Phone Plan Finder&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Samsung D307 combines the functionality of a computer, phone, and personal stenographer. This phone is perfect for those who prioritize messaging.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While many phones offer texting, it&amp;rsquo;s often cumbersome due to limited keys and multiple functions. Alternatively, bulky PDA-style phones are available but not pocket-friendly. The D307 offers a solution: a flip-phone, barely larger than a business card, with a backlit QWERTY keyboard and a rotating rectangular display.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When closed, the D307 resembles a typical clamshell phone, displaying essential information like date, time, signal strength, and battery life. Open it, and you&amp;rsquo;ll find a large 176 x 220 pixel color display. Make calls traditionally, use the speakerphone, or connect a Bluetooth headset for tangle-free conversations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The magic unfolds when texting. Swivel the display horizontally, transforming the phone into a miniature notebook computer. The QWERTY keyboard allows for quick and easy message composition. Alternatively, dictate your message using the built-in voice-to-text feature, effortlessly converting your spoken words into written text.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beyond being a phone, the D307 functions as a mini-computer, leveraging the Cingular EDGE network for data communication. It comes equipped with instant messaging, email, and a mobile web browser. All this, combined with a talk time of up to 300 minutes or 5 hours.&lt;/p>

This is a significant achievement in the telecommunications industry, which is characterized by independent small businesses. The key motivators for telephone system installers and network consultants to join this nationwide database are customer leads and residual income.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Businesses specializing in computer network and telephone sales and service usually operate locally or regionally. They value inquiries from nearby businesses that need equipment, installation, training, upgrades, or repairs. While traditional advertising methods like Yellow Pages were once sufficient, businesses now often compare prices and suppliers online. The VAR Network addresses this by providing a national database where potential buyers can quickly find local registered sellers. Searches can be tailored to specific equipment, services (wiring, routers, IP PBX systems, etc.), or brands (Cisco, Avaya, ShoreTel).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The VAR Network also features sections for refurbished equipment, VAR-posted ads seeking specific equipment, and searchable listings of network engineers by skillset.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Joining the VAR Network and accessing its features is free for both buyers and sellers. VARs who secure business through the network are expected to pay a finder&amp;rsquo;s fee – 10% of service charges and 2% for equipment. While leads are provided free to registered VARs, those who successfully convert leads receive more than those who don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Through Shop For T1, Telarus also provides support for voice and data lines within the VAR Network. This is beneficial because many VARs lack expertise in providing services like T1, DS3, Ethernet WAN, and Optical Carriers, often leaving this to the customer and local phone companies. Shop For T1 acts as a broker for multiple service providers, connecting customers with suitable products through a user-friendly online platform and a team of technical sales agents who streamline the ordering process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This collaboration allows VARs to access competitive quotes for their clients without becoming experts in these services. Customers benefit from better line prices than going directly to a phone company. VARs can offer a complete package of equipment and line service while earning residual commissions based on monthly customer usage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The VAR Network&amp;rsquo;s unique approach has generated significant interest from networking and phone system suppliers seeking to expand their customer base without additional marketing costs. The listing process is straightforward, involving a short online form and a telephone interview. Once listed, VARs can immediately start receiving leads from potential clients searching online.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Interested companies can explore the range of products and services offered by the VAR Network on their website. VARs can find the online application link on the Network&amp;rsquo;s homepage.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Pair of Beomaster 1900 Receivers for Restoration: Capacitor Replacement on Unit #2</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-pair-of-beomaster-1900-receivers-for-restoration-capacitor-replacement-on-unit-2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jul 2024 03:47:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-pair-of-beomaster-1900-receivers-for-restoration-capacitor-replacement-on-unit-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>The first Beomaster 1900 receiver is fully operational and undergoing testing in a listening room. However, the second unit still requires restoration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Initial assessment of the second Beomaster 1900 has already been completed, and now it&amp;rsquo;s time to begin replacing capacitors on the main circuit board.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main circuit board houses most of the capacitors that need replacing. Unfortunately, it cannot be removed for servicing and must remain connected to the wire harness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Replacing capacitors on this board requires flipping the Beomaster over repeatedly to desolder old components and solder new ones. While experienced restorers might remove multiple capacitors at once, a safer approach is to replace them one by one, carefully checking polarity and value.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To prevent damage from repeated movement, I desolder the transformer&amp;rsquo;s secondary power wires from the board before starting the recapping process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Several screws secure the main board to the chassis and heatsink assemblies. Since the plan involves replacing the thermal material on the output transistors, I remove the heatsinks to clean off the old paste.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With that done, the main board is ready for servicing. I use a simple foam block jig to support and protect the board during this process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, I replace the +15 VDC power supply filter capacitor and apply new thermal paste, using a Sil-Pad for the chassis-mounted transistor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the ±31 VDC power supply filter capacitors, I rearrange and reattach terminals with heat shrink for a secure connection.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The rest of the capacitor replacements on the main board are straightforward, although time-consuming.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the main board completed, only the Volume PCB and the Tone, Filter, and Tuning PCB remain to be recapped.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>European academics are appealing for the EU to avoid becoming a lawless zone.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/european-academics-are-appealing-for-the-eu-to-avoid-becoming-a-lawless-zone/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jul 2024 22:29:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/european-academics-are-appealing-for-the-eu-to-avoid-becoming-a-lawless-zone/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhuTZpexk3LR95LTpJ9Zxcd_wloaB-ZThTVx2JI-APjEQd5ho7UDTeKGUb7FJrRWMe-ehSfs23WhOn67xOepw6lc8jETMk-bEDPvwpQiYGNH_x_EEzE8jm4jlrMLRk0ID_AHJqglv8HTcqmrZbKaEtvakSHofguPnQ0Bc9O0Rw2ByvcRxyI-x5xaj0B=s843" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>The situation at the Polish-Belarusian border briefly gained public awareness, with images of suffering refugees stranded in terrible conditions sparking outrage. While there were discussions and reactions, the humanitarian crisis persists.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since September 2021, the Polish government has restricted access to the border zone, putting migrants in danger and denying aid organizations access. People are facing dire circumstances, including death, due to lack of basic necessities and medical help.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Polish border guards are accused of violating international law by denying asylum requests and forcing people back to Belarus, a practice known as refoulement. This practice, deemed illegal by multiple international agreements, has resulted in families being turned away repeatedly and even separated, worsening the crisis. Despite calls for humanitarian aid and condemnation of human rights violations, the situation remains critical.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The European Commission&amp;rsquo;s proposed solution, rather than upholding the right to asylum, grants border authorities more power to potentially refuse asylum seekers and legitimize mass expulsions. This response has been criticized for framing the situation as a security threat rather than a humanitarian crisis, further endangering vulnerable individuals and undermining the EU&amp;rsquo;s core values.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The authors call on the EU to prioritize human rights and find compassionate solutions to address this crisis by protecting vulnerable individuals and upholding the right to asylum. They emphasize that this is not about criticizing individual countries but upholding the universal principles of law and human rights that safeguard everyone in a democratic society.&lt;/p>

While high speeds are affordable within a company&amp;rsquo;s LAN, connecting to the outside world traditionally comes with much higher costs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is because WAN connections were typically provided by telecom companies using technology initially meant for phone services. While more modern providers have entered the market with updated infrastructure, even traditional providers are adapting to the demand for data services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This increased competition presents opportunities for businesses to save money on bandwidth. By comparing prices from different providers, companies may find better deals than their existing contracts, especially if those contracts are outdated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Engaging a telecom broker can simplify this process. Brokers can gather tailored quotes from multiple carriers, leveraging their relationships to secure competitive rates for businesses. Using a broker often results in better deals than businesses could get independently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another way to save on bandwidth costs is to switch to newer technologies. For example, Ethernet over Copper (EoC) offers comparable reliability and speed to traditional T1 lines but at a lower cost. EoC can provide double the bandwidth for the same price as a single T1 line, making it a cost-effective upgrade path.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Therefore, businesses have two primary options for increasing bandwidth without increasing costs: compare quotes from multiple providers, including newer entrants, and consider switching to newer, more cost-effective technologies like EoC. Utilizing both strategies can lead to significant savings on essential bandwidth services.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Numerous White Papers Available</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/numerous-white-papers-available/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jul 2024 19:08:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/numerous-white-papers-available/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been going through a phase where white papers feel incredibly relevant to challenges we face internally and with clients.

&lt;p>This week, I completed a custom Dynamics GP 2013 eConnect integration created as a Visual Studio Tools AddIn. The client wanted a GP menu item to open the integration window, so I used the Menus for Visual Studio Tools library to create a custom menu item.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The integration worked perfectly, and I packaged it for deployment at the client site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, during final testing and verification, I encountered unusual window behavior. The custom VST window would sometimes open &amp;ldquo;CenterScreen&amp;rdquo; as intended, but other times it would open in the screen&amp;rsquo;s upper left corner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After further testing, the window seemed to open centered on the first launch after starting GP. Subsequent openings would position it in the screen&amp;rsquo;s upper left corner. I attempted various settings, including manually setting the window Location property, to center the window. Despite these efforts, the window would consistently open in the upper left corner, disregarding my code&amp;rsquo;s manual Location setting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Random window positions are incredibly frustrating, especially when they appear in the upper left corner for no apparent reason.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Perplexed, I built a new VS Tools project with a test window. When opened from GP, this window functioned correctly, consistently opening in the center. This discrepancy deepened the mystery.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I meticulously compared every window property in my integration project with the test VST project. All properties were identical, yet the behavior differed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, I noticed a distinction. In my test project, where the window consistently opened CenterScreen, the icon in the window&amp;rsquo;s upper left corner was different. Instead of the GP window icon, it was a standard Windows Form icon. This suggested it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a Dynamics GP VST Form but a standard Windows Form. This realization was significant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I then added a second window, this time a Dynamics GP Form, to the test project. I replicated all the window properties from the Windows Form. Upon launching both windows, the Dynamics GP Form opened in the upper left corner, while the Windows Form opened CenterScreen, confirming my suspicions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgNgb0QRjVZq9rnV3lmeLC7QEVApxox1dGi9aXQuMTdoiYQzkdTIQeLZLQlOM5XvQ4_ljPs-7qMp7GkcWghnnxtkerDp8ZgospZzCigtGluwykq3OCUdF5FPI0VgkSrKUrYv-hWdWY3zdwe/s1600/VSTWindowPosition.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

loading="lazy"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This screenshot illustrates the standard Windows Form opening CenterScreen, while the Dynamics GP Form opens in the upper left corner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And if that isn&amp;rsquo;t the most adorable picture ever featured in a Dynamics GP blog post, I don&amp;rsquo;t know what is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It appears that altering the Dynamics GP Form&amp;rsquo;s window Startup Position or Location settings triggers a bug that disrupts proper window positioning, ignoring the set properties. I experimented with various settings, but none reliably replicated the CenterScreen behavior.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After extensive testing, here&amp;rsquo;s what I discovered:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When StartPosition is set to CenterScreen and the Location value is 0, 0, the VS Tools window will consistently open in the upper left corner. It might position correctly initially, but changing the StartPosition or Location setting seems to make it default to the upper left.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Adding code to set the form Location property during the OnLoad event results in the window opening CenterScreen on the first attempt. However, subsequent openings reposition it to the upper left corner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Interestingly, changing the Location to a non-zero value, such as 100, 100, allows the Location property to function consistently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, there seems to be an additional caveat. Based on numerous tests, setting the Location only works if it&amp;rsquo;s the first line in the Form Load event. Any code that refreshes the form afterward will cause the Location setting to be disregarded from the second window opening onward.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To summarize:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Set the form Location property to a non-zero value, like 100, 100.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Add this as the very first line in your Form Load event:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s common to accumulate unused phones after upgrading contracts or switching carriers. Technological advancements and tempting free offers often lead us to replace phones before they&amp;rsquo;re truly unusable. While understandable, this habit results in drawers and boxes filled with neglected devices. These phones quickly lose value and often end up discarded, contributing to electronic waste and releasing harmful substances like lead and cadmium into landfills.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, there&amp;rsquo;s a profitable and responsible alternative. Recycling companies offer cash incentives for trading in used cell phones. These devices are then refurbished and made available to markets where affordability outweighs having the newest model, such as developing countries.&lt;/p>

The unit arrived in remarkably good shape. The dust cover is practically flawless, and the aluminum panels and platter are in fantastic condition.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, there is a hole drilled into the top left corner of the aluminum plate surrounding the platter, meaning this part will need replacement. Thankfully, beneath the plates, the turntable appears to be in pristine, original condition.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This originality is a positive sign, as it usually means fewer unexpected problems during restoration. The turntable has the orange plastic transport lock bushings, which, as expected, disintegrated during shipping. Thankfully, the plinth corners are in perfect condition – a rarity!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Upon plugging in the turntable and pressing start, the carriage moved slowly to the LP setdown point and attempted to lower the arm. This is a good indication of the turntable&amp;rsquo;s overall health. A thorough cleaning and re-lubrication of the carriage and arm lowering mechanism should address the slow movement. This test also showed that the 33 RPM trimmer backlight bulb is out and the carriage pulley is cracked, both relatively easy fixes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, this Beogram 4002 is a great candidate for a complete restoration. With some work, it should return to like-new functionality. Stay tuned for updates on the restoration process!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Examining the Reunification of Ireland from an EU Legal Viewpoint</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/examining-the-reunification-of-ireland-from-an-eu-legal-viewpoint/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jul 2024 00:03:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/examining-the-reunification-of-ireland-from-an-eu-legal-viewpoint/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj-lOhJ6z5U1VheJRO3roZLYLlFrD9DcbMr9IpK54MTJkw3LKvtHrlIUV6NHwvDTI-cKvKOiMkK2mOaeuFWOyYRnj4Y9vQaWXUFxHa5fOlifJU_BQCeKLWdImaOXg3oa_zN4zJPYIWK0Lk/s1600/stormont.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>Secessions, Constitutions and EU law&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When the UK voted to leave the EU on June 23, 2016, Northern Ireland voted to remain. This result has led Sinn Féin to call for a referendum on Irish unification, which would allow Northern Ireland to stay in the EU. This discussion has gained momentum following the most recent Northern Ireland Assembly election, which saw a significant decrease in the Unionist vote.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Putting aside the political feasibility of such an event, it&amp;rsquo;s important to note the legal perspective. The UK government has formally acknowledged that Northern Ireland can legally separate from the UK and join a unified Ireland if both the people of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland vote in favor of it. This recognition is codified in Section 1 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, which stands out as a rare example of a constitutional statute that explicitly grants a region the right to secede (see also the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/136652/agreement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Good Friday Agreement&lt;/a>). However, Schedule 1 of the Northern Ireland Act states that such a referendum can only happen if the UK Secretary of State believes there is a likely majority in favor of Northern Ireland leaving the UK to become part of a unified Ireland. Former Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers has stated that she sees no indication of majority support for such a poll.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Despite this, should the majority in Northern Ireland ever democratically choose to secede from the UK and unify with the Republic of Ireland, the EU&amp;rsquo;s legal framework can accommodate this. Northern Ireland&amp;rsquo;s secession wouldn&amp;rsquo;t create a new Member State. Instead, it would trigger a territorial expansion of an existing EU Member State (Ireland) where EU law already applies, as per Article 52 TEU. This reunification process could resemble the German reunification, where East Germany adopted the EU acquis without requiring amendments to primary EU legislation. However, a key difference is that the EU acquis did not apply in East Germany before reunification, unlike the current situation in Northern Ireland.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Interestingly, Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny has recently called for a special provision in any Brexit deal that would allow Northern Ireland to rejoin the EU if it reunifies with the Republic. This request comes despite the UK government&amp;rsquo;s stated aim to secure a special deal for Northern Ireland.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This begs the question: what could such a provision look like?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The EU law doesn&amp;rsquo;t have many provisions that address the reunification of Member States. A relevant example is Article 4 of Protocol No 10 on Cyprus of the Act of Accession 2003. This protocol outlines how EU law applies to Cyprus, given the island&amp;rsquo;s division at the time of EU accession. Specifically, it suspends the application of the acquis in northern Cyprus until a solution for unification is reached.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Article 4 outlines a streamlined procedure for the EU to incorporate the terms of a reunification plan if such a solution emerges. It grants the EU the authority, through a unanimous Council Decision made at a future date, to modify the terms of Cyprus&amp;rsquo;s EU accession as laid out in the Act of Accession 2003. Essentially, it empowers the Council to amend primary EU law (the Act of Accession 2003) through a unanimous decision.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While this might seem unusual, the EU treaties allow for special amendment procedures in certain situations. A prime example is the Council decision based on Article 2(2) of the 1994 Accession Treaty. This decision adjusted the accession instruments following Norway&amp;rsquo;s rejection of the treaty. It amended several articles within the Accession Treaty and the Act of Accession through a simplified procedure that bypassed individual Member State ratification.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Assuming the ‘Brexit’ Agreement is considered part of primary EU law, a similar provision concerning Irish reunification could be included. This would facilitate a smooth transition for Northern Ireland back into the EU. However, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to remember that Irish reunification, like many issues stemming from Brexit, is primarily a political matter. Nevertheless, this discussion highlights the adaptability of EU law in accommodating such political developments.&lt;/p>

They are exploring ways to provide this service, similar to phone and cable companies. Offering high-speed internet can be a significant advantage in attracting and retaining tenants.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Becoming an internet service provider, even for a single building, requires reliable, dedicated internet access. T1 or Dedicated Internet provides this, ensuring the full bandwidth is dedicated to your use, unlike shared services like DSL and Cable. Consumer-grade services often prohibit sharing or reselling, while T1 allows you to share the connection with multiple users within your building.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With T1, you get a professional telecommunications service commonly used by small ISPs. A T1 Router connects to your building&amp;rsquo;s network, serving up to 25 users on a single line. Multiple T1 lines can be combined for even greater bandwidth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each T1 line offers 1.5 Mbps upload and download speeds, unlike services with limited upload speeds. While this may seem moderate, it is often sufficient for most users due to the dedicated nature of the connection. Bonding multiple lines can increase speeds up to 12 Mbps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>T1 service includes a Service Level Agreement (SLA), guaranteeing high availability and quick response times in case of outages. It is a reliable solution widely used by businesses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The cost of providing internet service to tenants can be incorporated into the rent or charged separately. Providing wireless routers and setup assistance can be a valuable amenity for tenants.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>T1&amp;rsquo;s advantage is its availability in areas where DSL and Cable internet are not accessible. It can be installed wherever traditional phone service is available.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The cost of T1 varies based on location and infrastructure. Prices start below $400 per month in major cities. Shared among tenants, the cost becomes very affordable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another option is T1 Integrated voice and data service, combining phone and internet on a single line. This is suitable for buildings requiring both services, with dynamic bandwidth allocation prioritizing internet use when no calls are in progress.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To determine if shared internet access is right for your property, consult with technical experts who can assess your needs and provide suitable options from various T1 service providers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dial-Up is Alive and Kicking</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/dial-up-is-alive-and-kicking/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jul 2024 19:17:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/dial-up-is-alive-and-kicking/</guid><description>&lt;p>In today&amp;rsquo;s world of high-speed internet, it might seem strange to talk about dial-up. Many people consider it outdated technology.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, dial-up internet access is still relevant. Millions of people still use and appreciate it for browsing the internet and checking emails. This &amp;ldquo;outdated&amp;rdquo; technology remains profitable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the main advantages of dial-up is its affordability. Unlimited access is available for a low monthly cost, making it a budget-friendly option compared to DSL or cable internet. The only cheaper option is free internet service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Free internet is accessible in many places, like restaurants with WiFi, if you have a laptop or notebook computer with WiFi capability. Most new computers have this feature, but older computers can be equipped with a WiFi modem for a small price. This allows you to enjoy free internet while having a meal, though you still need to pay for the food.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, relying on free WiFi has its limitations. It is not convenient if you need frequent access to your email or live in an area without readily available WiFi. Traveling or working late at night also presents challenges with relying solely on free WiFi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If any of these situations apply to you, dial-up internet service might be a suitable choice. Most laptops and desktop computers, except for a few exceptions like the thin Apple Air (which has an accessory modem available), have a built-in dial-up modem. If your computer has a phone jack, it likely has a built-in modem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You might be surprised at the capabilities of a 56 Kbps connection. Basic web browsing on text and graphics-heavy sites is possible, and some websites might load slowly even on broadband, making the difference unnoticeable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A personal experience highlighted the usefulness of dial-up as a backup. When a cable internet provider experienced a lengthy service disruption during an upgrade, having a dial-up connection allowed for continued internet access. While broadband-dependent users struggled, those with dial-up could continue their online activities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This situation demonstrates the value of dial-up as a reliable backup option when your primary broadband connection fails. While some providers offer limited free dial-up minutes as a backup, it&amp;rsquo;s not always guaranteed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For those currently using or considering dial-up, exploring options like World Verge Dial-Up Internet is recommended. They provide unlimited access, local numbers, a travel-friendly dialer, spam and virus protection, email accounts, web space, compatibility with various computers, and 24/7 technical support for a reasonable monthly fee.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If faster web browsing is desired, an optional accelerator can enhance page loading speed. While it doesn&amp;rsquo;t affect music or video downloads, it can significantly improve the browsing experience for a small additional monthly cost.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Bartlomiej Kulpa, LLM (London), PhD Candidate (Amsterdam) @KulpaBart&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Introduction&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Treaty of Lisbon introduced Article 50 to the Treaty on European Union (TEU), establishing the legal framework for exiting the European Union (EU). This article acknowledges the possibility of withdrawal, a concept many legal experts believed existed even before the Treaty of Lisbon. Article 50 TEU outlines the withdrawal procedure. However, some argue that it contradicts the EU&amp;rsquo;s fundamental nature and weakens member states&amp;rsquo; commitment to European integration, raising questions about the ideal withdrawal mechanism.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Nature of the EU&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The inclusion of a withdrawal clause in the TEU arguably clashes with the EU&amp;rsquo;s essence. The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has established the distinct legal character of the EU, notably in cases like &lt;em>Costa v ENEL&lt;/em> and &lt;em>Commission v France&lt;/em> (Case 7/71). The CJEU consistently emphasizes the EU&amp;rsquo;s indefinite duration, as stated in the founding treaties, and the irreversible nature of the integration process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Articles 53 TEU and 356 TFEU establish the unlimited duration of the TEU and TFEU, respectively. This raises the question of whether Article 50 TEU conflicts with these articles. One interpretation is that the &amp;ldquo;unlimited period&amp;rdquo; refers only to the treaties&amp;rsquo; duration, not permanent membership, and therefore doesn&amp;rsquo;t preclude withdrawal. Conversely, it could be argued that the treaties&amp;rsquo; permanence implies no legal exit route.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, this alternative interpretation has weaknesses. First, it fails to differentiate between the permanence of the organization and that of its membership. An international organization can be permanent even with an exit clause. Second, member states, as the &amp;ldquo;masters of the treaties,&amp;rdquo; can create new treaties or amend existing ones. They even hold the procedural power to prevent the CJEU from overturning treaty amendments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Regarding the irreversible nature of integration, the EU&amp;rsquo;s current state differs significantly from 40-50 years ago. Nonetheless, participation in European integration has always been voluntary. EU membership represents the highest level of participation. Countries can opt for alternative forms, like association agreements, joining the European Economic Area (EEA), or establishing bilateral agreements like the EU-Swiss model. Therefore, withdrawal aligns with the voluntary nature of European integration, challenging the notion of its irreversibility. Additionally, Article 48(2) TEU allows for amendments that reduce the EU&amp;rsquo;s competences.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Loyalty of the Member States&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another point to consider is the impact of Article 50 TEU on member states&amp;rsquo; loyalty to European integration. German development economist Albert O. Hirschman&amp;rsquo;s concept of loyalty suggests that members facing a decline in an organization&amp;rsquo;s benefits can either exit or attempt to improve the situation (voice).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In practice, loyalty encourages member states to seek improvement rather than withdraw, fostering hope for internal reform. However, Article 50 TEU, by making withdrawal legally and practically feasible, potentially undermines this loyalty.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Eurosceptics might view the withdrawal clause as a justification for leaving rather than pushing for change. This is evident in criticisms leveled at EU bureaucracy, free movement of people, regulatory procedures, costs, and the transfer of power to the EU.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Withdrawal Negotiations&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some argue that the withdrawal clause favors the EU and its institutions by placing the withdrawing member state at a disadvantage during negotiations. Several points support this view.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, under Article 50 TEU, the EU dictates the withdrawal negotiation timeline. Second, the withdrawing member state is excluded from initial discussions where remaining member states define their negotiating stance. This process unfolds in two phases: first, remaining member states draft a withdrawal agreement, considering proposals from the exiting state; second, this draft is presented to the exiting state&amp;rsquo;s negotiators for acceptance or rejection.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Third, future trade relations necessitate a separate agreement negotiated either alongside the withdrawal agreement or after departure, as suggested by EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom in the context of a potential British exit. While unlikely to be completely dismissed, this adds complexity. Finally, Article 50(4) TEU excludes representatives of the withdrawing state from EU council discussions and decisions that concern them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Withdrawal negotiations are crucial for both the exiting state and the EU. They should encompass a range of issues related to a smooth transition, including: (i) the status of EU citizens in the withdrawing state and vice-versa; (ii) unspent EU funds allocated to the withdrawing state&amp;rsquo;s regions and farmers; (iii) the closure of EU agencies based in the withdrawing state; (iv) interim trade arrangements; (v) exiting EU free trade agreements with other nations and international agreements; (vi) employment law concerning citizens of the withdrawing state employed by the EU; (vii) recognition of CJEU rulings; and (viii) arrangements for CJEU judges and Advocate General from the withdrawing state.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These factors suggest that Article 50 TEU gives the EU an advantage during withdrawal negotiations. This begs the question: what constitutes an ideal withdrawal mechanism? Three theoretical mechanisms exist: (i) state primacy; (ii) federal primacy; and (iii) federal control. State primacy grants an absolute, immediate, and unilateral right of withdrawal, indicating a lack of commitment. Federal primacy deems withdrawal legally impossible based on the principle of permanent membership. Federal control, however, requires approval from both the withdrawing state and the remaining members. To determine a suitable mechanism, the EU and its member states must identify their potentially shared interests. Observing the UK-EU withdrawal negotiations and their outcomes will be crucial.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Conclusion&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Articles 53 TEU and 356 TFEU do not preclude the possibility of exiting the EU. A British exit would likely impact other member states&amp;rsquo; commitment to European integration. Critically, contentious withdrawal negotiation issues should be resolved before finalizing any agreement. However, Giuliano Amato, former Italian Prime Minister, believed Article 50 TEU was never intended to be used. Whether he is correct remains to be seen.&lt;/p>

This innovation allows for WAN connections over copper, achieving speeds up to 500 Mbps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While Gigabit Ethernet is achievable with Cat-6 wiring for LAN connections, this technology focuses on connecting businesses to broadband providers using existing copper infrastructure. This is significant because many businesses require increased bandwidth for various purposes, including server farms, internet access, data transfer between locations, and the growing need for electronic medical record transfers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fiber optic cables offer superior bandwidth but come with high installation costs. Copper wiring, being ubiquitous and already in place, presents a cost-effective alternative. Ericsson&amp;rsquo;s approach leverages multiple copper pairs instead of relying on a single twisted pair. Using six copper pairs, they achieved 500 Mbps over a 500-meter range, enabling connections to nearby fiber-equipped buildings or FTTC boxes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While not a novel concept, Ethernet over copper is already used in metropolitan areas. Ericsson&amp;rsquo;s technology takes it further, surpassing the 50-100 Mbps limitations of current installations. Similar to existing techniques, it employs multiple pair transmission and MIMO analysis to mitigate interference and signal reflections inherent in bundled copper cables.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With anticipated availability by year-end, Ericsson&amp;rsquo;s equipment offers a promising solution for businesses struggling with bandwidth limitations and seeking alternatives to expensive fiber optic installations. Existing copper-based services offer 45 Mbps speeds over a few miles, making this new technology a potential game-changer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>E-Rate Supports Gigabit Internet for Schools &amp; Libraries</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/e-rate-supports-gigabit-internet-for-schools-libraries/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 22:48:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/e-rate-supports-gigabit-internet-for-schools-libraries/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>By: John Shepler&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

Surprisingly, many elementary schools and libraries lack adequate internet access. They require modern broadband speeds, surpassing the outdated megabit per second standard. Today&amp;rsquo;s requirements necessitate fiber optic connections.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The FCC acknowledges this need, promoting internet speeds of at least 100 Mbps per 1,000 users for schools and libraries, with plans to increase this to 1,000 Mbps. Larger libraries require even faster speeds. The goal is to eventually achieve 10 Gbps per 1,000 students.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>More Funding for Higher Bandwidths&lt;/strong>
E-Rate, the government program providing discounts for internet access, has received a funding boost, increasing from $2.4 billion to $3.9 billion annually. A portion of this funding will support high-speed internet access, while the remaining funds will enhance infrastructure, including Wi-Fi. Support for outdated services like pagers and traditional phone lines will be phased out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>How to Qualify for E-Rate Discounts&lt;/strong>
Schools, school districts, and libraries can apply for E-Rate discounts through the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC). Service providers must also apply and receive a Service Provider Identification Number (SPIN). Many major carriers are already equipped to provide fiber optic broadband connections at various speeds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>How Much Are the Savings?&lt;/strong>
E-Rate offers discounted service prices. Qualifying schools and libraries pay less for broadband access than businesses. The discount is determined by the poverty level and urban or rural status of the population served. Discounts range from 20% to 90%, calculated based on student eligibility for the national school lunch program.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Easy Want to Find E-Rate Broadband&lt;/strong>
While researching local providers or national carriers is an option, using a company specializing in E-Rate services simplifies the process. These companies, working with multiple carriers, can identify E-Rate providers in your area. This service is free, and inquiries are obligation-free.&lt;/p>

Maintaining earnings through cost-cutting instead of increased sales won&amp;rsquo;t be sustainable. When the economy fully recovers, rapid adaptation will be crucial, but increased expenses are only justifiable with increased revenue. Bandwidth on demand offers a solution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bandwidth on demand allows businesses to access and pay for only the bandwidth they currently need, scaling usage up or down as required. This differs from the traditional approach of installing full capacity in advance, which poses financial risks if projected growth doesn&amp;rsquo;t materialize.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bandwidth on demand offers flexibility, allowing businesses to increase or decrease bandwidth as needed. This adaptability is valuable in uncertain economic conditions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Various services, often Ethernet-based, offer bandwidth on demand. Capabilities depend on the provider and existing infrastructure, such as copper or fiber optic cables.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ISDN PRI, for example, can support up to 23 phone lines on a single line. Businesses can start with a smaller number of lines and add more as call volume grows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even T1 lines, offering 1.5 Mbps, can be purchased fractionally, allowing for future upgrades to full capacity or beyond by combining multiple lines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Consulting a bandwidth specialist is recommended to determine the most cost-effective options based on current and projected needs. Free consultations are available through Telarus.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The CJEU revives the old 'third pillar' with the EU Zombie Law.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-revives-the-old-third-pillar-with-the-eu-zombie-law/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 18:24:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-revives-the-old-third-pillar-with-the-eu-zombie-law/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgXu1QxkUF5ol_ODfwYawXbMz8o051ZEO7TYbhxnuujti2Jvejpm91JvWVE2qwM6OqrDt7pF77_LDkYaW76xdxw_qLG2UPMsE45SwbuHvDhHmSImxUKXgBvoEo-n0X0SCZ_R2DX4VaTVaE/s1600/zombie&amp;#43;law.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Steve Peers&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 1993, the Maastricht Treaty&amp;rsquo;s implementation brought about the EU&amp;rsquo;s adoption of criminal law and policing measures under a unique system known as the &amp;rsquo;third pillar&amp;rsquo; of EU law. Although modified by the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1999 and facing multiple attempts at its abolishment over the following decade, it persisted until the Treaty of Lisbon, which formally ended it upon coming into effect on December 1, 2009, albeit with a five-year transitional period.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While this suggests the third pillar ceased on December 1, 2014, that wasn&amp;rsquo;t the case. Two judgments from the CJEU on this date upheld the validity of existing third pillar measures and allowed new measures based on them. Instead of disappearing completely, third pillar measures have become more like &amp;lsquo;undead&amp;rsquo; entities - lingering remnants of EU law.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Background&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Treaty of Lisbon includes a transitional Protocol with two relevant rules concerning the third pillar. Firstly, Article 10 outlines a five-year transitional timeframe after which the CJEU&amp;rsquo;s jurisdiction would apply to these measures. The UK had the option to withdraw from all measures during this period and later opt back into specific ones, which it did the following year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Secondly, Article 9 of the Protocol, not bound by a time limit, states that third pillar measures adopted before the Treaty of Lisbon remain valid until amended or repealed. While some have undergone these changes or will soon, the majority, including the contentious European Arrest Warrant (EAW), remain active.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The significance of this is threefold. First, pre-Lisbon measures lack direct effect on individuals, meaning they can&amp;rsquo;t be used to establish rights in national courts. Second, the European Parliament (EP) held no significant influence in enacting these measures, despite having valuable suggestions for reforming the EAW. Lastly, it raises the legal question of whether these pre-Lisbon measures can justify adopting new measures even after the Lisbon Treaty&amp;rsquo;s implementation, a question addressed by the judgments mentioned earlier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Judgments&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The EP challenged the legitimacy of post-Lisbon Council measures implementing pre-Lisbon EU criminal law acts. These measures specifically granted police access to the EU&amp;rsquo;s Visa Information System and banned certain new designer drugs. Similar ongoing cases challenge measures implementing pre-Lisbon laws related to Europol and the &amp;lsquo;Prum&amp;rsquo; system for data exchange among national police forces.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The EP&amp;rsquo;s objection stemmed from the Council exercising these powers through qualified majority voting without consulting the EP, arguing that the legal requirement for consultation, present in the old third pillar rules within the Treaty, was revoked by the Treaty of Lisbon. The EP believes the Council should use the post-Lisbon rules for implementing measures, granting the Commission power to adopt delegated acts under the EP&amp;rsquo;s control. Otherwise, new EU legislative acts, subject to the ordinary legislative procedure, are required.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The CJEU determined that pre-Lisbon measures remain valid according to Article 9 of the transitional protocol, implying the Council&amp;rsquo;s right to implement measures following pre-Lisbon procedures. However, diverging from the Advocate-General&amp;rsquo;s opinion, the Court stated that the Council must at least consult the EP on these measures. Essentially, the Court reasoned that the cross-reference to repealed Treaty rules within the pre-Lisbon legislation maintains their validity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Court&amp;rsquo;s decision enables the Council to create new third pillar acts despite its nominal demise. It&amp;rsquo;s comparable to &amp;lsquo;zombie procreation&amp;rsquo; in the legal context. Moreover, the Court&amp;rsquo;s justification for the EP&amp;rsquo;s partial win suggests that even aspects of the defunct Treaty rules on the third pillar are revived.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While not a full-blown &amp;lsquo;zombie apocalypse&amp;rsquo; in EU law, the potential impact of these measures is significant. Aside from these specific implementations, all other EU criminal law acts post-Lisbon take the form of Directives and Regulations, subject to post-Lisbon procedures. Many pre-Lisbon EU measures like the EAW don&amp;rsquo;t require implementing measures, and those that do, such as the Europol law, face imminent replacement.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although the Court&amp;rsquo;s rulings reasonably interpret the transitional rules, the broader political concern remains: numerous controversial measures impacting civil liberties lack meaningful input from the EP. Given the limited success of court actions, the EP should explore alternative strategies like legislative or budgetary blocks to review pre-Lisbon EU criminal laws and, crucially, secure vital EAW reforms.&lt;/p>

The old plugs often show corrosion due to the lack of gold plating. Upgrading to modern, all-metal plugs with gold-plated terminals is recommended. This upgrade minimizes electromagnetic interference and ensures optimal signal transfer to the amplifier by maintaining low contact resistance, especially important for the delicate MMC20 cartridge signals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The original RCA plugs on a Beogram 4002 (5513) being restored were in poor condition.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They were replaced with high-quality Amphenol plugs featuring a full metal body and plated contacts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The newly installed plugs look excellent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This particular Beogram also had a shortened grounding wire.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s perplexing why anyone would cut cables instead of coiling and securing any excess length. A significant number of Beograms have been found with cut power or output cables. The damaged grounding wire was replaced with a new 16-gauge wire, matching the length of the RCA cables, restoring it to its full functionality.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002: Polishing the Hood</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-polishing-the-hood/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 16:20:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-polishing-the-hood/</guid><description>&lt;p>My work on restoring the 4002 continues, and today involved polishing the hood – a task that&amp;rsquo;s quite a workout!

This change aimed to enhance the stability of the DC motor control system by reducing heat generation, a common issue with traditional bulbs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The new SMD LED circuits, designed for a seamless drop-in replacement, feature red and green LEDs calibrated to mimic the warm glow of incandescent lighting. This spectrum, especially the inclusion of red photons, ensures accurate illumination of the red plastic RPM indicators.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The installation process involves several steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Removing the RPM panel&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Taking off the bulb covers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Extracting the old bulbs&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The LED assemblies, designed to fit precisely within the existing housing, offer a straightforward upgrade path for enthusiasts looking to enhance their Beogram 4002 turntables. A video tutorial demonstrating the installation procedure is available for those interested in undertaking this modification.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5514): First Impressions</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5514-first-impressions/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 14:05:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5514-first-impressions/</guid><description>&lt;p>A Beogram 4002, model 5514, recently arrived in its original packaging, complete with styrofoam, which is remarkable! The platter was separately packaged in a vinyl box for added protection.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The turntable is in excellent cosmetic condition, requiring only cleaning. Even the keypad is in good shape, though using a 4002 Commander remote control could help prevent future wear.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The veneer corners are flawless, and the internal components appear untouched.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Initial testing showed the turntable powers on and the motor functions, but the arm doesn&amp;rsquo;t lower. This is likely due to hardened lubricant in the arm mechanism, a common issue that can be resolved during restoration. An RPM test will be conducted before working on the platter drive system. The transport lock bushings are deteriorated, but replaceable with custom-designed parts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unique to the 5514 model is a power-on LED in the lower left corner, connected to the main circuit board. The hood, though scratched, can be polished to regain its shine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Beogram included an MMC20EN cartridge in its original box. While the cantilever is slightly misaligned, a common problem with this model, the cartridge still functions and could be used as a spare or repaired.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, this Beogram 4002 presents a fantastic foundation for a complete restoration.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cloud vs Premises Contact Center Costs</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/cloud-vs-premises-contact-center-costs/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 05:11:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/cloud-vs-premises-contact-center-costs/</guid><description>&lt;p>Lots of small businesses can get by with just a local or toll-free number for customer calls. But as companies grow, they usually dedicate staff and resources to handle customer interactions, creating a dedicated department known as a contact center. While contact centers are important, they can be expensive to run. Is there a way to reduce the cost?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.cloudnetworkingservices.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;img src="http://www.CloudNetworkingServices.com/images/CloudContact250.jpg"
loading="lazy"
alt="Find out how much a cloud based contat center can save over the traditional premises approach&amp;hellip;"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Until recently, outsourcing to different locations was an option, but that often led to issues with language barriers and inconsistent service quality. These days, companies highlight their in-house customer service as a competitive edge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So how can businesses make running an in-house contact center more affordable? The key is to lower both setup and operational costs while boosting efficiency. This is where cloud-based solutions come into play.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Traditional contact centers require significant physical infrastructure, including expensive PBX phone systems. These systems can be pricey to maintain, become outdated, and eventually require replacement, leading to a costly cycle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The new approach is to keep your trusted agents but move the technology infrastructure to the cloud. This means no more managing bulky, expensive equipment. Cloud-based contact centers offer the same functionality but with added flexibility and scalability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One leading company in this field is inContact. They provide a cloud-based contact center solution that&amp;rsquo;s much more robust than a basic hosted PBX system. It allows agents to work from anywhere with an internet connection, whether that’s in the office or remotely. This opens up opportunities to hire talented individuals who may not be geographically close to your physical location.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unlike traditional systems with limited capacity, cloud solutions can easily adapt to your needs. If your business experiences seasonal spikes, the cloud can effortlessly scale up to handle the increased call volume and then scale back down during quieter periods.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But is the cloud reliable enough? inContact offers a 99.99% uptime guarantee through its redundant data centers in Dallas and Los Angeles. With six layers of security, your data is kept safe and private. Their background as a telecom carrier means they can also provide reliable internet connectivity, simplifying your setup and support.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How much can you actually save? While it depends on individual circumstances, studies indicate that businesses can achieve 30% lower operating costs with as few as 50 users, and savings can exceed 50% for larger contact centers with 500 users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Interested in learning more about pricing, potential savings, and available features? You might be surprised by the opportunities you&amp;rsquo;re missing.&lt;/p>

It provides dedicated bandwidth at a reasonable cost, making it a reliable choice. However, another service called Ethernet over Copper (EoC) is gaining popularity as a viable alternative.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/a>EoC is an Ethernet WAN connection that can connect multiple business locations or provide a dedicated high-speed Ethernet connection. It can also serve as an access point to private cloud networks, including national and international MPLS networks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Both EoC and T1 lines are delivered using existing telephone wiring, known as twisted-pair cabling. Both technologies utilize multiple wire pairs through a process called bonding to increase bandwidth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While they use different protocols and modulation techniques to transmit data, these technical details are generally not a concern for users. The important factor to consider is the amount of bandwidth available at a given price point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In many cases, EoC offers both higher bandwidth and lower prices. This is partly due to the technology&amp;rsquo;s efficiency in transmitting data over copper wiring. Additionally, competitive carriers aiming to establish a market presence often promote EoC, driving down prices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>T1 lines typically provide a reliable 1.5 Mbps per line, which can be increased by adding more lines through bonding. However, bonding beyond 10-12 Mbps becomes less cost-effective, making other solutions like DS3 more suitable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ethernet offers a broader range of bandwidth options, from low speeds of around 1 Mbps to the standard 10 Mbps Ethernet used in LANs, and even up to 45 Mbps. However, EoC has distance limitations, requiring proximity to a carrier point of presence. T1 and bonded T1 solutions, on the other hand, do not face these limitations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For businesses in rural areas or locations where EoC is unavailable, an emerging option called Ethernet over DS1 (EoDS1) offers a solution. EoDS1 utilizes the DS1 data specification used in T1 lines to transport Ethernet, effectively delivering Ethernet over a T1 line using specialized equipment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The best service ultimately depends on your location. To make an informed decision, consider obtaining competitive quotes from providers. Request an &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.copperethernet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

Similarly, today, we&amp;rsquo;re witnessing &amp;ldquo;spectrum renewal,&amp;rdquo; where sections of the radio frequency spectrum are deemed too valuable for older technologies like analog TV and cell phone service, despite their widespread use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This isn&amp;rsquo;t driven by lack of public demand. Millions of analog TV sets and cell phones are still functional. While people desire new technology like HDTV, not everyone can instantly replace existing devices. Analog cell service, vital for systems like OnStar and home alarms, faces a similar fate, leaving users stranded when it&amp;rsquo;s shut down.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The driving force behind this is intense competition for limited spectrum resources. Unlike the past, where new technologies like FM radio and UHF TV coexisted with existing ones, today&amp;rsquo;s demand for bandwidth-heavy services necessitates reclaiming spectrum occupied by older technologies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This mirrors the challenges of dealing with outdated infrastructure. Just as land is finite, usable radio frequency spectrum is a limited resource. The most desirable frequencies, offering high bandwidth and good signal propagation, are in high demand, creating pressure to replace older technologies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While spectrum renewal enables advancements in mobile technology, it has downsides. The potential financial gains from spectrum auctions contribute to the push to shut down analog TV. Similarly, broadband over power line technology could disrupt shortwave radio.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This raises the question: is this progress at an acceptable cost? While necessary for advancements in mobile technology, the challenge lies in minimizing disruptions as we transition away from technologies we&amp;rsquo;ve come to rely on.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Installation of a Neutrik Gold Plated DIN5 Plug</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-installation-of-a-neutrik-gold-plated-din5-plug/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 00:12:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-installation-of-a-neutrik-gold-plated-din5-plug/</guid><description>&lt;p>A common improvement for the Beogram 4000 is replacing the DIN5 plug with a gold-plated version.

>CLEAR is already rolling out its 4G WiMAX network&lt;/a>? If you happen to live in an area where CLEAR WiMAX is currently offered, you can experience internet speeds comparable to DSL or Cable, all without the need for physical wires. They have a range of plans to suit your needs, whether it&amp;rsquo;s for your home, mobile device, or both.&lt;/p>

alt="4G wireless broadband"
>Now, you might be wondering, what exactly is WiMAX, and how does it stack up against 3G? In simple terms, WiMAX is a globally recognized standard for wireless broadband, often described as WiFi but on a much larger scale, covering entire cities. While there are technical differences between the two, the comparison to city-wide WiFi is a good way to understand its potential uses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The acronym WiMAX stands for &amp;ldquo;Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access&amp;rdquo; and is technically defined by the IEEE 802.16 standard, similar to how WiFi operates under the IEEE 802.11 standard. However, a key distinction is that WiMAX utilizes licensed frequencies and operates at a much higher power level. In contrast, WiFi shares unlicensed frequencies with a variety of devices like microwave ovens, Bluetooth devices, and cordless phones, all of which function at significantly lower power levels. This difference in frequency and power is the reason why your WiMAX connection remains strong even in your car or at home, while a WiFi signal weakens as you move away from its source, such as a cafe or your home network.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Remember when there was a big push to transition from analog to digital television broadcasting? A significant portion of the freed-up airwaves were auctioned off, and Clearwire emerged as one of the major winners. They utilized these acquired channels to offer their CLEAR WiMAX service. Thanks to the lack of signal interference and the strategic placement of powerful transmission towers, WiMAX can cover a significantly wider area, penetrating walls and reaching further distances. To use it, you&amp;rsquo;ll need a modem designed for either a PC or Mac, which connects to your computer or router much like a traditional broadband modem, except it receives its signal wirelessly. A more portable version, resembling a USB flash drive, is also available for laptops, offering mobile connectivity. The beauty of WiMAX is that it provides consistent service throughout the city, even while you&amp;rsquo;re on the move.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You might be thinking: &amp;ldquo;Doesn&amp;rsquo;t 3G cellular broadband offer similar capabilities?&amp;rdquo; You&amp;rsquo;re right, it does. However, WiMAX generally surpasses 3G in terms of speed. This advancement is why it&amp;rsquo;s categorized as 4G, or fourth-generation technology, signifying a step up from 3G. But what kind of speeds can you actually expect with WiMAX? CLEAR advertises average download speeds ranging from 3 to 6 Mbps, with bursts reaching up to 10 Mbps, a speed rarely achieved by 3G mobile broadband.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently, CLEAR WiMAX is accessible in select areas across the US, with plans to expand to more cities soon. The service is most prevalent in Texas, spanning nearly a dozen cities. Beyond Texas, CLEAR is also available in Hawaii; the Seattle-Portland corridor; Boise, Idaho; Chicago, Illinois; Las Vegas, Nevada; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Atlanta and Milledgeville, Georgia; and Charlotte, Greensboro, and Raleigh, North Carolina.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another compelling advantage of CLEAR WiMAX 4G is its affordability. With plans starting at $30 per month, it&amp;rsquo;s often cheaper than many DSL and cable broadband plans and significantly more budget-friendly than 3G cellular data plans. And because it&amp;rsquo;s wireless, you eliminate the hassle of scheduling installations—the equipment is delivered straight to your doorstep, ready for you to set up and activate at your own convenience. No more waiting around for technicians. As a bonus, you can even combine home and mobile service, a feature that DSL and cable providers simply can&amp;rsquo;t match.&lt;/p>

While multiple T1 lines can increase bandwidth, this approach might not be the most cost-effective solution, especially in metropolitan areas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Point-to-point Ethernet offers a compelling alternative, often at a lower cost per Mbps, particularly for higher bandwidth needs. Ethernet streamlines data transmission by maintaining its format throughout the network, potentially allowing locations to function as a single bridged LAN.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This Ethernet connection, known as E-Line service, acts as a direct replacement for traditional T1 lines, forming a virtual Ethernet cable between two points. For those requiring multiple Ethernet services through a single physical connection, EVPL (Ethernet Virtual Private Line) presents a viable option.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When multiple locations need interconnected communication, E-LAN (Ethernet LAN) service provides a meshed network solution, enabling communication as if all sites share a single LAN.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Alternatively, E-Tree service facilitates point-to-multipoint connections, ideal for content distribution from a central source to multiple recipients without user interaction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To determine the optimal Ethernet service for your business, consider comparing pricing and features to see how much you can save.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Is the draft renegotiation deal a legitimate rejection?

&lt;p>Dr. Katarzyna Granat, Junior Research Fellow &amp;amp; Marie Curie Fellow, Durham Law School &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Donald Tusk&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;A New Settlement for the United Kingdom within the European Union&amp;rdquo; (Draft Decision of the Heads of State or Government), presented on February 2, 2016, provides an initial concrete outline for enhancing the role of national parliaments within the UK&amp;rsquo;s renegotiation efforts. This note compares the proposed changes with existing mechanisms under the Lisbon Treaty.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tusk&amp;rsquo;s proposal (Section C, points 2-3) suggests that reasoned opinions from national parliaments, submitted under Article 7.1 of Protocol No. 2 (&amp;ldquo;on the application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality&amp;rdquo;), should be &amp;ldquo;duly taken into account&amp;rdquo; by all institutions involved in EU decision-making. National parliaments would have 12 weeks to submit reasoned opinions on draft EU legislation, citing violations of the subsidiarity principle. If these opinions represent over 55% of allocated votes (at least 31 of 56, with each national parliament having two votes, one per chamber in bicameral systems, excluding votes from parliaments not participating in the legislation&amp;rsquo;s adoption), the Council would hold &amp;ldquo;comprehensive discussions.&amp;rdquo; If the draft legislation remains unchanged despite national parliaments&amp;rsquo; concerns, the Council would cease its consideration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This proposal differs from the Lisbon Treaty&amp;rsquo;s existing &amp;ldquo;yellow&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;orange&amp;rdquo; card mechanisms in terms of timeframe, thresholds, and effects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Firstly, the Lisbon Treaty allows national parliaments eight weeks to submit reasoned opinions to the Commission, European Parliament, and Council (Article 6 of Protocol No.2). Tusk&amp;rsquo;s proposal extends this to 12 weeks, giving national parliaments more time for analysis and drafting, a change frequently requested by national parliaments and likely welcomed. However, it&amp;rsquo;s unclear if this extension also applies to &amp;ldquo;yellow&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;orange&amp;rdquo; card procedures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Secondly, while vote allocation remains the same, Tusk&amp;rsquo;s proposal sets a different threshold for triggering action. The &amp;ldquo;yellow card&amp;rdquo; requires reasoned opinions representing at least one-third of allocated votes to flag a Commission proposal&amp;rsquo;s non-compliance with the subsidiarity principle. The &amp;ldquo;orange card&amp;rdquo;, applicable only in ordinary legislative procedures, requires a simple majority. Tusk&amp;rsquo;s proposal, in contrast, requires 55% of votes – meaning 19 votes for a &amp;ldquo;yellow card,&amp;rdquo; 29 for an &amp;ldquo;orange card,&amp;rdquo; and 31 for this new procedure. This new threshold is only slightly higher than the &amp;ldquo;orange card&amp;rdquo; threshold, which has never been met.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thirdly, the most significant difference lies in the consequences of triggering this new procedure. The &amp;ldquo;yellow card&amp;rdquo; has limited impact: the Commission reviews the draft and decides whether to maintain, amend, or withdraw it, providing justification (Article 7.2 of Protocol No. 2). For the &amp;ldquo;orange card,&amp;rdquo; the Commission has similar options, but maintaining the proposal requires a reasoned opinion demonstrating its compliance with subsidiarity. The European Parliament and Council then decide, considering arguments from both the Commission and national parliaments. If 55% of Council members or a majority of the European Parliament finds a subsidiarity breach, &amp;ldquo;the legislative proposal shall not be given further consideration&amp;rdquo; (Article 7.3 of Protocol No. 2). Tusk&amp;rsquo;s proposal bypasses the Commission&amp;rsquo;s response phase, moving directly to the Council. If the proposal isn&amp;rsquo;t amended to address national parliaments&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;concerns,&amp;rdquo; Member State representatives in the Council &amp;ldquo;will discontinue&amp;rdquo; consideration. This differs from the &amp;ldquo;orange card,&amp;rdquo; which only halts proceedings if the Council identifies a subsidiarity breach.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Notably, crucial details are absent, such as who amends the proposal and ensures national parliaments&amp;rsquo; concerns are met. The Commission has previously been satisfied that its proposals addressed concerns outlined in reasoned opinions. However, Tusk&amp;rsquo;s proposal seems to demand a more proactive response from EU institutions compared to the &amp;ldquo;orange card.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Furthermore, Tusk&amp;rsquo;s proposal doesn&amp;rsquo;t grant national parliaments veto power over Commission proposals. Discontinuing the legislative process depends on whether the &amp;ldquo;concerns&amp;rdquo; are addressed, with the final decision residing with the Council, not national parliaments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Interestingly, Tusk&amp;rsquo;s proposal focuses solely on reasoned opinions regarding a proposal&amp;rsquo;s compliance with the subsidiarity principle. However, during subsidiarity scrutiny under Protocol No. 2, national parliaments often critique aspects beyond strict subsidiarity, such as the legal basis, proportionality, or political merits of a proposal. It remains unclear whether such a broad approach would be adopted in the Council under Tusk&amp;rsquo;s proposal. If so, amending a proposal to adequately address all concerns raised by national parliaments might prove challenging, potentially making it easier to halt the legislative process due to unmet demands.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Therefore, a broader interpretation of Tusk&amp;rsquo;s proposal might align with Cameron&amp;rsquo;s aim of empowering national parliaments to &amp;ldquo;stop unwanted legislative proposals&amp;rdquo; by allowing a threshold of national parliaments to do so, though Cameron also emphasized the need for full implementation of the subsidiarity principle. The proposed draft declaration &amp;ldquo;on a subsidiarity implementation mechanism and a burden reduction implementation mechanism,&amp;rdquo; obliging the Commission to review existing EU legislation for compatibility with subsidiarity and proportionality principles to ensure &amp;ldquo;full implementation,&amp;rdquo; might offer a more concrete solution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lastly, requiring discussion within the Council, as per the tabled proposal, could mean that the ministers&amp;rsquo; flexibility towards their national parliaments&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;concerns&amp;rdquo; and their ability to reach a consensus on continuing or halting the legislative procedure might be influenced by the nature of the relationship between parliaments and their respective governments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In conclusion, compared to the rejected &amp;ldquo;red card&amp;rdquo; from the Convention on the Future of Europe, which sought a two-thirds majority of national parliaments to compel the Commission to withdraw a proposal, Tusk&amp;rsquo;s proposal has a lower threshold and doesn&amp;rsquo;t immediately halt the legislative process.

From creating basic applications in school to more complex projects later on, you were there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We tackled various challenges, from writing a Windows application for a psychology thesis to automating tasks with WordPerfect macros. You adapted well to new environments, proving valuable in Microsoft Office VBA and early ERP systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our journey continued with web applications, e-commerce integrations, and custom desktop apps. Even when I returned to Dynamics GP after a while, your classic version seamlessly handled integrations with VB 6 eConnect.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There were times when you felt a bit clunky, especially within the limitations of GP&amp;rsquo;s Modifier and Integration Manager. However, I patiently worked through those challenges.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Meeting your .NET version felt familiar yet different, like moving to a new neighborhood while recognizing familiar faces. However, I questioned the hype around C#. Why switch when VB was comfortable and familiar?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Intrigued, I experimented with small C# projects. It felt different, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t pinpoint why it was supposedly better. Despite my initial skepticism, I persisted with more C# projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s when my perspective shifted. Returning to our old VB code, it felt cluttered and less intuitive. In contrast, C# seemed cleaner, more logical, and efficient. My coding improved, becoming more consistent and reusable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Seeing you relegated to the &amp;ldquo;Other Languages&amp;rdquo; option in Visual Studio 2008 felt like a sign of the times. While it&amp;rsquo;s time for me to embrace new technologies, I acknowledge your significant role in my coding journey.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We might still cross paths in maintaining legacy code, but for now, I bid you farewell.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Steve Peers&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Brexit vote is often seen as an attack on both academic expertise and EU citizens in the UK, whether accurate or not. These two issues intersect in a recent dispute involving the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and the London School of Economics (LSE). The FCO allegedly barred EU citizens from advising the government on Brexit, though the details are unclear.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The LSE reportedly informed staff that the FCO no longer sought Brexit advice from EU nationals, sparking a controversy that made its way to social media and prominent news outlets like The Guardian. This occurred amidst a series of government announcements perceived as hostile towards foreigners. While the FCO denies making such a statement, the LSE stands by its claim. Two central questions arise: Did the FCO implement this policy, and did the LSE act appropriately?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Determining the Truth&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s possible this was a misunderstanding. However, it&amp;rsquo;s more plausible that the FCO did have this policy, and the LSE, or at least some within the institution, discovered a way to challenge and overturn it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>University administrators are well-versed in navigating government policies, especially concerning funding, student matters, and immigration. Their understanding of these policies is crucial as most university funding relies on it. Therefore, it&amp;rsquo;s unlikely that the LSE misinterpreted the FCO&amp;rsquo;s communication. When told that certain staff members are ineligible to contribute to a government project, university administrators would typically seek further clarification.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That said, it&amp;rsquo;s equally improbable that the FCO would advise the LSE of a policy likely to be deemed illegal, xenophobic, and detrimental. The FCO, known for its rigorous recruitment standards and the expertise of its personnel, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t create such a policy without a formal process or clear communication.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Perhaps recent shifts within the FCO, like the appointment of a controversial Foreign Secretary or the influence of a Prime Minister&amp;rsquo;s chief of staff known for his hardline stance on immigration, could explain this. Notably, an FCO official involved in this alleged policy publicly expressed support for criticism directed at it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Evaluating the LSE&amp;rsquo;s Response&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Assuming there was indeed such a policy, what options did the LSE have? It could have complied, though it&amp;rsquo;s unknown if other universities chose that route. It could have discreetly questioned the policy, requesting written confirmation or raising concerns privately. Alternatively, the LSE could have publicly challenged the policy, demanding an explanation. Finally, it could have taken a more indirect approach by informing its staff without directly confronting the government, likely resulting in public scrutiny and criticism—which is ultimately what happened. Perhaps a consensus couldn&amp;rsquo;t be reached internally, or a staff member dissented, leading to the public outcry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, what was the best course of action? Openly challenging the policy would have evoked the LSE&amp;rsquo;s history as a center of activism, but those days are gone. Today, the institution prioritizes navigating a highly competitive environment. Complying with the policy would have meant accepting a legally and ethically questionable directive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This leaves discreet inquiry and indirect opposition as the remaining options. While the former is typically the most diplomatic approach when dealing with problematic government policies, the latter effectively pressures the government to reconsider without direct confrontation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a week marked by discussions about expelling foreign doctors, publicly shaming companies employing foreign nationals, and barring most universities from admitting foreign students, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to take a public stand. If the UK is becoming less open to the world, academics must advocate for openness.&lt;/p>

With this new technology rapidly evolving, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to keep up with the latest companies and deals. If you&amp;rsquo;re looking to switch to VoIP or simply want a better deal, you need a way to compare your options. That&amp;rsquo;s where a comparison shopping service comes in handy, allowing you to easily evaluate available services and choose the best fit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fortunately, a free online tool does just that: &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.affordablevoip.com/voip.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Affordable VoIP&lt;/a>. This guide is designed for residential users and small to medium businesses needing single or multi-line phone service without the cost and complexity of a traditional phone system. Larger companies with their own PBX systems may be interested in &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.enterprisevoip.com/usa/IPTelephony/ip_telephony.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>ISDN PRI and SIP Trunks&lt;/a>, but if that sounds unfamiliar, Affordable VoIP is likely the right choice for you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s explore how this tool works. On the &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.affordablevoip.com/voip.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>VoIP comparison shopping page&lt;/a>, you can select &amp;ldquo;Business&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Residential&amp;rdquo; as your Plan Type. If you make international calls, choose your most frequently dialed country. You can also check boxes for specific features like &amp;ldquo;No Activation Fee&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Adapter/Router included&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;Digital Phone included.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Clicking the &amp;ldquo;Search&amp;rdquo; button generates a results list within seconds. For example, a search for a business plan including an adapter/router and international calls to the United Kingdom might yield plans from several providers with varying prices and features. Hovering over a provider&amp;rsquo;s name provides a brief description of the plan, while clicking the name or magnifying glass reveals complete details on the vendor&amp;rsquo;s website.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The results page allows you to sort by column, making it easy to compare costs. Clicking on the &amp;ldquo;United Kingdom&amp;rdquo; column might reveal that Phone Power&amp;rsquo;s Freedom Business Unlimited package offers the lowest per-minute rate. You can also sort by other criteria like Service Provider, Plan Name, Monthly Cost, Activation Fee, and Regular Minutes. Once you&amp;rsquo;ve found a suitable plan, click the &amp;ldquo;Order Now&amp;rdquo; link to be directed to the vendor&amp;rsquo;s order page. A link at the bottom of the chart allows you to modify your search criteria and explore other options. This tool simplifies the process of comparing plans and pricing from various providers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Residential users will find a similar experience, with typically more vendors and lower costs than business plans. The option to include an international destination remains, often showcasing surprisingly low international rates with VoIP services.&lt;/p>

However, a new service called Business Ethernet is emerging as a strong competitor, offering comparable performance at a lower cost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.t1rex.com/explainer.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;img src="http://www.EtherRabbit.com/images/BusinessEthernetGrowthChart200.gif"
loading="lazy"
alt="Business Ethernet is Growing. Check prices for your location now."
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Business Ethernet, also referred to as Metro Ethernet, Ethernet over Copper, or Ethernet over Fiber, provides advantages such as scalable bandwidth options, reduced cost per Mbps, and wider availability. Its name emphasizes that Ethernet is no longer limited to Local Area Networks (LANs) and carriers, as it&amp;rsquo;s rapidly being adopted by SMBs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ethernet&amp;rsquo;s strength lies in its position as the universal standard for computer networking. Most desktop PCs, routers, switches, and cabling infrastructures are built to support Ethernet. This widespread adoption, driven by economies of scale, makes it challenging for other technologies to match Ethernet&amp;rsquo;s price-performance ratio.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The dominance of Ethernet has prompted telecom companies to re-evaluate their public networks. While T1 lines, DS3 bandwidth, and OCx services rely on circuit-switched technology initially designed for telephone calls, Ethernet operates on packet switching. As most networks have transitioned to packet switching, it&amp;rsquo;s logical to align telecom networks with this standard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>End-to-end packet switching presents intriguing possibilities. When LAN, Metropolitan Area Network (MAN), and Wide Area Network (WAN) all utilize Ethernet, businesses can implement layer 2 switching to connect multiple locations. This allows each location to maintain its own LAN while being interconnected through MAN and WAN Ethernet services, effectively extending the company network across different sites.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Business Ethernet&amp;rsquo;s scalability allows businesses to order a range of bandwidth options, often referred to as ports. As long as usage stays within the port&amp;rsquo;s capacity, bandwidth can be adjusted in small increments, even as low as 1 Mbps. This flexibility lets businesses acquire the bandwidth they need currently and easily upgrade as their requirements grow, optimizing costs without sacrificing performance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When comparing costs with T1, variations exist depending on location and competition. However, it&amp;rsquo;s not uncommon to find 3 Mbps Ethernet priced similarly to a 1.5 Mbps T1 line. Another popular choice is 10 Mbps Ethernet, which often costs about the same as a T1 line from a previous contract period.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ethernet over Copper stands out by utilizing specialized terminal equipment, installed by the service provider, to combine multiple copper pairs for the telecom connection. This enables bandwidths of up to 50 Mbps over existing copper wiring, eliminating the need for new fiber optic installation. Although T1 lines can also be bonded, their bandwidth is limited to a maximum of 10 or 12 Mbps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ultimately, the best choice depends on the specific needs of your business. Both T1 and Business Ethernet are reliable, professional-grade digital line services. Comparing competitive quotes for both options can help determine which option offers the most significant cost savings.&lt;/p>

So why worry about the small costs involved? Firstly, saving money is always a good thing. Secondly, the more affordable conference calls are, the more you can use them to boost productivity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s examine AccuConference, a leading teleconferencing provider, and see their pricing options. AccuConference offers both flat rate and pay-as-you-go conference calls.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Flat-Rate option is ideal for regular, even daily meetings. The best part of flat-rate pricing is that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to watch the clock, worrying about the cost when someone rambles on. With a flat rate, you pay a fixed monthly fee based on the number of participants you can have on a call. Participants call a 404 Atlanta number and cover their own long-distance charges. Your call can last as long as needed, though people tend to lose focus after an hour or two. After 10 hours, the system automatically ends the call, and you&amp;rsquo;ll need to start a new one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, what&amp;rsquo;s the cost of this flat rate? It starts at $14.95 per month for up to 5 lines on the conference. Of course, people might use speakerphones to include an entire conference room. Five lines are sufficient for most working groups and project teams. But what if your company needs to host larger training calls? For larger groups, you can get up to 50 lines for $199 a month and hold daily conferences if needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>AccuConference also provides toll-free pay-as-you-go conference calls. There are no setup fees, monthly minimums, or contracts. You simply pay for what you use. The cost is a small per-minute charge, usually 7.9 cents per minute per participant. Participants dial a toll-free number, and you cover the call costs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What about international participants? They can also call in toll-free. Their cost depends on their location. For example, calls from Canada cost 9.9 cents per minute, Australia and the UK are 12.9 cents per minute, and Mexico is 32.9 cents per minute. Most of Europe falls under 20 cents per minute.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, compare these costs to travel expenses for in-person meetings. You&amp;rsquo;ll be amazed at how connected you can stay using affordable flat-rate or pay-as-you-go conference calls.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Users successfully importing transactions might find that the associated Analytical Accounting data is missing in GP. This issue often stems from incorrect import procedures and misleading error messages from eConnect. To clarify, this article outlines how to correctly include Analytical Accounting data in an eConnect import.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A thorough review of the eConnect Programmer&amp;rsquo;s Guide section on the &amp;ldquo;taAnalyticsDistribution&amp;rdquo; node is crucial. The guide contains misleading elements and an inconsistency that could cause confusion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s break down some key fields in the help file:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>DOCNMBR&lt;/strong>: This field should reflect the Dynamics GP document number, like the Journal Entry or Voucher Number. In the context of a PM voucher, it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the vendor&amp;rsquo;s invoice/document number.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>DOCTYPE&lt;/strong>: This field differs from the numeric document type value used in the main transaction import. The bottom of the &amp;ldquo;taAnalyticsDistribution&amp;rdquo; help page provides a list of AA DOCTYPE values to use based on the main transaction type.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For instance, when importing a PM Voucher, use the value &amp;ldquo;zero.&amp;rdquo; This contrasts with the DOCTYPE=1 used in the &amp;ldquo;taPMTransactionInsert&amp;rdquo; node.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>DistSequence:&lt;/strong> This field is optional if your distributions have unique GL accounts. When dealing with duplicate accounts in your distribution, provide this value. This usually means assigning the DistSequence value in your transaction distributions to pass them to AA.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>ACTNUMST&lt;/strong>: This represents the GL account number for the distribution line linked to the AA entry. Although marked as &amp;ldquo;Not Required,&amp;rdquo; it&amp;rsquo;s recommended to populate this value. However, if you&amp;rsquo;re already using DistSequence, ACTNUMST becomes redundant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When handling AA distribution values, ensure you&amp;rsquo;re using valid AA dimension and code values. The combination should be valid and compatible with the GL account. This validation process can be tedious during AA data imports, especially if the customer frequently adds AA codes or GL accounts. Validating all AA data before import simplifies the process for the user, as it prevents eConnect errors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Refer to the provided code snippet for importing a GL JE. As long as the AA values are correctly assigned, the process should be straightforward.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Professor &lt;strong>Steve Peers&lt;/strong>, University of Essex&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This extension was unexpected. Despite the Benn Act, which mandated the Prime Minister to request a three-month extension for EU membership if Parliament failed to approve a withdrawal agreement by October 19, the Prime Minister insisted he would rather resign than comply. Fueled by ambiguous sources within Downing Street, there was persistent speculation that the Benn Act was unconstitutional, riddled with loopholes, would be superseded by emergency powers, or violated EU law. It was suggested that Boris Johnson, with his legal prowess, would effortlessly dismantle the Benn Act. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>While legal experts questioned these assertions, many political journalists (with notable exceptions) disregarded them, seemingly valuing the opinions of politically-minded advisors with no legal experience over those with actual legal expertise. There was also a belief that an extension, requiring unanimous agreement from EU Member States, would be vetoed by countries like Poland, Hungary, or France.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, an extension prevailed. This demonstrates a significant disconnect between the legal realities and the political narratives surrounding the situation, particularly among political journalists.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>EU law issues&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Article 50(3) TEU governs extensions of EU membership during a Member State&amp;rsquo;s withdrawal process. It states that treaties cease to apply to the withdrawing state either on the effective date of the withdrawal agreement or two years after the withdrawal notification, unless the European Council unanimously decides to extend the period with the agreement of the withdrawing state. Unanimity remains valid despite abstentions, and the European Council can choose to act through written procedure if needed. The withdrawing state must consent to the wording of the European Council decision, a process governed by UK law. Neither the European Parliament nor national parliaments have a formal role in this process. While Article 50(3) does not specify whether multiple extensions are allowed, the EU clearly operates under the assumption that they are legally permissible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The initial extension decision outlined two scenarios for extending membership beyond the original Brexit date of March 29, 2019, contingent on whether the House of Commons approved the initial withdrawal agreement. The first extension, lasting until April 12, 2019, was implemented because the agreement was not approved. The subsequent extension, lasting until October 31, was contingent upon the UK holding European Parliament elections in May (which it did). It could have ended sooner had the UK ratified a withdrawal agreement, which did not occur.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The third extension decision simply grants Parliament&amp;rsquo;s request for a three-month extension. The only additional detail in the main text is the mention of earlier Brexit dates if the withdrawal agreement is ratified ahead of time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The preamble of this decision highlights the EU&amp;rsquo;s need for operational stability, including the UK&amp;rsquo;s obligation to appoint a Commissioner. It reiterates that EU law remains applicable to the UK during an extension and acknowledges the UK&amp;rsquo;s right to retract its withdrawal notice. The principle of &amp;lsquo;sincere cooperation&amp;rsquo; within EU law is emphasized, particularly for a withdrawing Member State. This expectation for a constructive and responsible approach from the UK, reflecting its status as a withdrawing member, is underscored.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These points were also present in the second extension decision&amp;rsquo;s preamble, except for the mention of appointing a Commissioner, which wasn&amp;rsquo;t immediately relevant then.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While recital 9 in the preamble mentions facilitating the withdrawal agreement&amp;rsquo;s ratification, this was also referenced in previous extension decisions. Recital 12, stating that UK appointments end on Brexit day, merely reiterates a known consequence of withdrawal, as previously noted in the second extension decision. Although recital 13 states that the withdrawal agreement cannot be reopened, a similar statement in the second extension decision did not prevent subsequent renegotiations. This recital also reiterates, as in the previous extension, that this is not an occasion to initiate negotiations on the future relationship and that any unilateral commitment, statement, or action by the UK should respect the spirit and letter of the Withdrawal Agreement. Notably, recital 8 acknowledges the discussions regarding a potential election in the UK.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A corresponding European Council declaration reiterates the extension decision&amp;rsquo;s preamble.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>UK law&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As previously stated, the Benn Act obligated the Prime Minister to request a three-month extension if no withdrawal agreement was approved by October 19. He complied (though without a signature and accompanied by other letters, which the EU disregarded) after Parliament chose to postpone consideration of the revised withdrawal agreement to allow for more time to scrutinize the proposed withdrawal agreement bill. This made the October 31 deadline unattainable. Although the Benn Act allows the Prime Minister to retract or modify the request if a withdrawal agreement is approved after October 19, the Speaker of the House of Commons deemed a renewed attempt to vote on the withdrawal agreement inadmissible, and Parliament later decided against an expedited review of the bill, rendering the October 31 deadline impractical, despite the bill passing its second reading.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Benn Act also mandated the Prime Minister to accept an extension decision once adopted by the EU. While Parliament could potentially vote down a decision if the extension period deviated from three months, the Prime Minister has accepted the EU decision. UK law automatically adjusts the definition of &amp;rsquo;exit day&amp;rsquo; according to another provision within the Act. (Update, October 30: the necessary secondary legislation to modify &amp;rsquo;exit day&amp;rsquo; has been enacted).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Given uncertainty surrounding the Prime Minister&amp;rsquo;s adherence to the Act&amp;rsquo;s obligations, two legal challenges sought to enforce it. In Scotland, the initial court ruling considered the challenge premature. However, upon appeal, the judges decided to put the challenge on hold to observe the Prime Minister&amp;rsquo;s actions regarding the extension request and later to maintain the hold to see if he would accept an extension decision. The High Court in England also deemed the action premature, a view upheld by the Court of Appeal. Separately, a challenge against presenting the revised withdrawal agreement before Parliament, based on the argument that the revised agreement&amp;rsquo;s customs arrangements violated previous legislation, proved unsuccessful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The mention of early termination dates if the withdrawal agreement is ratified simply reflects existing law. As highlighted in the preamble of this extension decision (recital 10), this is inherently part of Article 50(3), considering that the agreement itself takes effect either on the first day of the month following ratification by both parties or on a different date specified in an extension decision. However, no other date is stipulated in this particular extension decision.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The reference to the unilateral revocation of the notice to leave the EU aligns with CJEU case law, as established in the &lt;em>Wightman&lt;/em> judgment. Similarly, the point about the UK retaining its obligations as a Member State echoes a principle from two previous CJEU rulings and reiterated in &lt;em>Wightman&lt;/em> concerning extensions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Regarding the appointment of a Commissioner, the matter is less pressing than it could have been, given the unrelated delay in the new Commission assuming office on the customary date of November 1. Notably, the third extension decision, unlike the second, which hinged on the UK holding European Parliament elections, does not make appointing a Commissioner a prerequisite for granting the extension. While the preamble acknowledges the possibility of UK elections, the extension isn&amp;rsquo;t contingent upon them, though the prospect may have influenced the French government&amp;rsquo;s support for a longer extension.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At present, it appears likely that the UK&amp;rsquo;s future relationship with the EU will be determined by a December election. This presents a choice between various options: the withdrawal agreement (Conservative party), a no-deal outcome (Brexit party), revoking the notification (Liberal Democrats), renegotiation followed by a referendum including an option to remain (Labour), or rejecting Brexit while supporting Scottish independence (SNP), among other parties. While renegotiation and a referendum would necessitate a further extension, the other scenarios wouldn&amp;rsquo;t. The final decision now rests with the public. Time will tell if this leads to a conclusive outcome.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project involved creating a RESTful JSON web service that enables a website to seamlessly integrate with Dynamics GP, Authorize.net, and the k-eCommerce/Azox Credit Card Extension. Given its role in handling sensitive credit card data, the web service prioritizes security by incorporating HMAC authentication, AES encryption, and operating exclusively over HTTPS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The customer utilizes an internal website for processing customer orders, gathering customer details, credit card information, and product selections. Previously, customer data was stored separately and manually entered or imported into Dynamics GP. Credit card transactions were managed through a payment gateway with recurring billing features, and all transaction data was entered into GP retrospectively. To streamline operations, the client desired a real-time integration between the website and Dynamics GP, allowing for immediate customer information updates in GP.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the client wished to avoid storing credit card information within Dynamics GP or the Credit Card Extension module, even in encrypted form, opting instead for tokenization. This process involves securely sending credit card data to the payment gateway, Authorize.net in this case, and receiving a unique identifier or &amp;ldquo;token.&amp;rdquo; This token, stored in the Credit Card Extension module, facilitates future credit card transactions within Dynamics GP.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The decision to utilize a RESTful architecture stemmed from the client&amp;rsquo;s website being developed with PHP on Linux, effectively excluding direct APIs like COM and .NET libraries. Given their familiarity with REST and its simplicity for this integration, REST emerged as the preferred choice over SOAP.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The selection of JSON as the data format was driven by the client&amp;rsquo;s developers&amp;rsquo; experience with JSON-based web services, simplifying implementation compared to SOAP or XML-based alternatives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the architectural decisions finalized, the next step involved addressing implementation details, including web service authentication. The client&amp;rsquo;s developer recommended HMAC, a secure and straightforward authentication method that involves hashing the request content combined with a shared secret key. This process generates a unique &amp;ldquo;password&amp;rdquo; that is virtually impossible to forge, ensuring secure request validation on the web service side. The project utilized SHA-256 as the hashing algorithm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To further enhance security, despite employing SSL and HTTPS for the web service, the transmission of credit card data as plain text was avoided. The team opted for AES-128 encryption, which proved more challenging than anticipated. Determining an &amp;ldquo;initialization vector&amp;rdquo; (IV) and navigating the differences in AES implementation between PHP and .NET presented significant hurdles. The team invested considerable effort in researching encryption settings, eventually discovering that PHP defaults to NULL padding, while the chosen encryption library used PKCS7 padding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Future blog posts will delve deeper into each element of this project.&lt;/p>

However, a new option allows for flexible scaling and a pay-as-you-go model: cloud server hosting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Discussions about cloud computing versus managing your own data center are becoming increasingly common. However, many companies haven&amp;rsquo;t reached the stage where investing in a complete in-house data center is necessary. They haven&amp;rsquo;t even considered setting up a server rack for web hosting, email, and other services. This is because outsourcing these tasks to hosting providers has become highly appealing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Small businesses, such as those operated by freelancers, small retailers, and design studios, often start with template-based websites and hosting provided by local web services companies. As they expand beyond the basic &amp;ldquo;brochure&amp;rdquo; website or desire more control over their design and hosting, they often transition to budget-friendly hosting services found online. With hosting plans costing less than $4 per month, there&amp;rsquo;s little motivation to handle everything themselves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How can companies offer such inexpensive hosting while remaining profitable? These low-cost plans fall under the category of shared hosting. While the control panel might give the impression of having a dedicated server, the reality is quite different. Dozens, or even hundreds, of other websites might share the same server without your knowledge. The only indication of shared resources might be occasional slowdowns. If your resource usage becomes excessive, the hosting provider might suggest upgrading to a virtual private server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What exactly is a virtual private server? It bridges the gap between shared hosting and a dedicated server. A dedicated server provides complete control over a physical machine with its processor, memory, and storage. However, this also means bearing the cost and responsibility of managing a potentially underutilized resource. Conversely, needing more resources would require upgrading to a larger dedicated server or a cluster of servers, which can quickly become expensive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>VPS hosting utilizes virtualization software. A single physical server is divided into multiple virtual servers, each functioning like a standalone physical server. Only you and the hosting service are aware that it&amp;rsquo;s a virtual server, not a dedicated one. This shared infrastructure significantly reduces costs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Virtual private servers offer increased resources and full root access, enabling software installation and customization. However, limitations remain due to sharing a physical machine and the challenges of adapting to changing resource requirements.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is where cloud hosting comes in. The principle behind cloud computing is a vast pool of resources, including processors, RAM, hard drives, and bandwidth, managed by a provider. Instead of selling a fixed portion, access to this pool is leased. Similar virtualization principles as VPS hosting apply, but the resource pool is practically limitless. This allows for effortless scaling to meet current needs and easy adjustments as those needs change.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cloud hosting servers provide choices of Linux or Windows operating systems, guaranteed CPU cycles, RAM, and hard disk space, hardware redundancy for reliability, full root/administrative access, a dedicated IP address, automatic nightly data backups, and compatibility with popular control panels like cPanel and WHM. Payment is based on hourly usage, without commitments, contracts, or setup fees. If servers are no longer needed, they can be canceled without penalty.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, which hosting solution best suits your company? It&amp;rsquo;s recommended that organizations compare VPS, collocated private servers, and cloud hosting options, considering both pricing and features, to determine the optimal choice.&lt;/p>

This project required me to access custom fields in modified GP windows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I installed the VS Tools SDK on my GP 2015 server and ran the DAG. However, the DAG would crash during the &amp;ldquo;Generating IL code&amp;rdquo; step.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even after upgrading to the latest hotfix, the issue persisted. My next attempt was to try the RTM version of the VS Tools SDK and GP 2015.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While searching for a solution, I came across forum posts describing a similar problem. The solution involved copying specific DLL files from the GP or AddIns directory to the VS Tools SDK folder. Based on these posts and advice from David Musgrave, I tried copying the BusinessObjects.dll file.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Through trial and error, I discovered that copying three specific DLL files from my GP 2015 folder to the VS Tools SDK folder resolved the DAG crash:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Microsoft.Dynamics.GP.BusinessObjects.dll&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Microsoft.Dynamics.GP.ManagementReporterServices.dll&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Microsoft.Dynamics.GP.Svc.Application.dll&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Although the DAG no longer crashed, it would stall at 99% during the &amp;ldquo;Creating Application.MicrosoftDynamicsGp.dll&amp;rdquo; step. However, it eventually completed after a few minutes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hopefully, this solution proves helpful to others encountering similar issues with the DAG.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update:&lt;/strong> For those experiencing Remote Desktop difficulties with high DPI screens, Nathan Hayden from BKD has a helpful workaround available at: &lt;a class="link" href="http://dynamicsinsights.com/2018/10/05/remote-desktop-high-dpi-dynamics-gp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;em>http://dynamicsinsights.com/2018/10/05/remote-desktop-high-dpi-dynamics-gp/&lt;/em>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Modern Windows laptops and desktops with high-resolution or 4K displays often encounter display issues with some software. These &amp;ldquo;high DPI&amp;rdquo; screens can make text appear minuscule at full resolution. To counteract this, Windows uses &amp;ldquo;scaling&amp;rdquo; to enlarge text and graphics for readability and usability. While the technical aspects are complex, the goal is straightforward: making the system functional.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Windows 10 typically suggests a 200% scaling level for optimal viewing on high DPI displays. However, a 175% scaling might be preferable for maximizing screen real estate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhwSuSyQ-fvtkzAYxl3jr2p8yzKOjFLW3KC4tJdJSgphU7gCQfr5rpsqIZnz_93m_gkcgEknZNj7j2AB-YHwmhUHEdgL2MOkKNC1rf52YX85dbZ5k0p1_cPfHwg76sa4SOgMySNREipsAZn/s1600/Scaling1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Scaling is generally effective, and many applications function seamlessly. Issues become apparent when an application isn&amp;rsquo;t designed to be &amp;ldquo;high DPI aware&amp;rdquo; or compatible. In such cases, display elements appear distorted, as exemplified by SugarSync in the example below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjdOAtMpcXbeep2iU0wgpMrCcUkSIfs1JkoHxng8Rmb32A9FxkJKukQJW85eSFjTUI77IQgVl46wM4k2LnuNW8eGTF61iaRYWOcoLhElnq1A7-Ebw5z8UaJ2zg5cDMiuKDyQ3s1ttN3eutI/s1600/Scaling2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While inconvenient, these inconsistencies are manageable. Dynamics GP 2015 initially seemed to display correctly on a Surface Pro 4. However, recent usage revealed an odd mix of font sizes, a problem also encountered by a colleague.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjUGvCIZZDtt68bnnGEYHEY6b-rKZOwM0ciss-H2pBY3tP3FpcZ2CjuCMOv7-z70Ie8n_pl6rzqZ5uLDdSPMgV_M3o0sxtito0U6JRms4y54H-s1Jm1oz-oOPAbTKGBwTA482rdKAC6j7Aa/s1600/GPBefore1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>The menu fonts appear oversized while the left pane text is too small. SQL Server Management Studio 2014 exhibits similar issues on high DPI displays. A search for a solution led to this insightful post:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.sqlservercentral.com/blogs/spaghettidba/2015/10/14/ssms-in-high-dpi-displays-how-to-stop-the-madness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>http://www.sqlservercentral.com/blogs/spaghettidba/2015/10/14/ssms-in-high-dpi-displays-how-to-stop-the-madness/&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The author&amp;rsquo;s grasp of Windows&amp;rsquo; high DPI settings led to a clever fix: modifying the scaling method for specific applications using a manifest file. While the technical details remain unclear, the solution proved effective. Importing a registry key and saving the Ssms.exe.manifest file resolved the display issues in SSMS 2014.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although bitmap scaling at 175% might result in a slightly blurry display, it greatly enhances usability. Adjusting the scaling to 150% or 200% could help if the blurriness is bothersome.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Encouraged by the success with SSMS, the question arose: Could this method work for Dynamics GP?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>(Full credit for this solution goes to &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.sqlservercentral.com/blogs/spaghettidba/2015/10/14/ssms-in-high-dpi-displays-how-to-stop-the-madness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Gianluca Sartori and his article&lt;/a>)&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Creating a Dynamics.exe.manifest file yielded impressive results. Dynamics GP launched and displayed correctly, without any font size discrepancies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjNT1Wtxc8VHvf733D6L51O3nmJvW0cP_6TlM042AeLAnVdsDOuIXEj2F9avu9EI8XUnrZmp8jyhw9lknUwALo9zifEaMUCEEy5xMVOXBP7X_zZUq-FvHl54mShkxTNgmQDjOrsDfmUy3TY/s1600/GPAfter1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Capitalizing on this success, a manifest file was created for SugarSync, successfully resolving its scaling issues. The existing SugarSync manifest file was edited to incorporate the additional settings from the SSMS 2014 example.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While the specific settings within the manifest file remain a mystery, its versatility is apparent, having been successfully applied across three different applications.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Those interested in attempting this fix are advised to proceed cautiously. If you lack experience with registry editing or troubleshooting potential system errors, seek assistance from an expert.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Save the following text as a file named &amp;ldquo;Scaling.reg&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00&lt;br>
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\SideBySide]&lt;br>
&amp;ldquo;PreferExternalManifest&amp;rdquo;=dword:00000001&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Double-click the created &amp;ldquo;reg&amp;rdquo; file to import it into the Windows registry on the machine running Dynamics GP.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, save the following text as a file named &amp;ldquo;Dynamics.exe.manifest&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p> &lt;br>
   &lt;br>
   &lt;br>
 &lt;/p>
&lt;p> &lt;br>
   &lt;br>
   &lt;br>
 &lt;/p>
&lt;p> &lt;br>
   &lt;br>
     &lt;br>
   &lt;br>
 &lt;/p>
&lt;p> &lt;br>
    false&lt;br>
 &lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Place the newly created Dynamics.exe.manifest file in the same directory as the Dynamics.exe file within the GP application folder.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Testing this solution to see if it resolves the small font issues in various GP scenarios would be beneficial. Feedback on its effectiveness is welcomed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>UPDATE:&lt;/strong> It appears that GP 2013 and GP 2015 have different scaling behaviors. GP 2013 exhibits a unique set of font size issues, displaying extremely small window fonts. The Dynamics.exe.manifest file corrected these issues as well.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>After installing GP 2013 R2, a few changes and new features are noticeable. One notable difference is the redesigned User Setup window.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>GP 2013 SP2:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The R2 window features the noticeable ribbon at the top, a standard change in R2. Additionally, the User Setup window incorporates a few key additions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>User Type:&lt;/strong> This option, offering Full or Limited access, dictates user permissions. A Limited user is restricted to inquiries and reports. Notably, users with the POWERUSER role cannot be changed from Full to Limited access. This restriction applies to the &amp;ldquo;sa&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;DYNSA&amp;rdquo; logins as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Web client user only:&lt;/strong> This option designates the user specifically for the web client. They will then use their Windows account credentials instead of a SQL login.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The window now has two tabs: one for SQL Server Account information and the other for specifying a Windows Account for web client users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, there is a &lt;strong>Home Page Role&lt;/strong> field, which, according to the help file:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&amp;ldquo;Assign[s] the user to a user role. The user role determines the content that is displayed on a user’s home page by default.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This field is currently disabled in the current installation. It is unclear if this is due to missing configuration settings or a future feature.&lt;/p>

He observes that while some customers have complex setups requiring thorough testing, many others have simpler environments where upgrading directly in production might be feasible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Endow acknowledges that GP upgrades in the past were often complicated, necessitating a separate test server. However, he notes that Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s acquisition of Dynamics GP led to a streamlined and more reliable upgrade process. This leads him to question whether a separate test environment and a full test upgrade are still essential, provided appropriate backups and a solid rollback plan are in place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He further inquires about specific factors that might make a test environment more critical, such as the use of third-party modules, customizations, integrations, the web client, on-premise versus hosted environments, and the volume of data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In an update, Endow highlights a point made by Tim Wappat on Twitter: the use of virtual machines for running GP allows for easy backups and cloning, simplifying rollback procedures and the creation of test environments, thereby minimizing the administrative overhead associated with them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The EC is proposing an AI Liability Directive to provide assistance.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-ec-is-proposing-an-ai-liability-directive-to-provide-assistance/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jun 2024 14:47:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-ec-is-proposing-an-ai-liability-directive-to-provide-assistance/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg4auuhdWo-oPCnu1lAuloCwRmXaw1oMn1ksXkQx9QGIuFYYp8Otx-_plin4LLR8Z65E4kSNj4PJGnD632v3iM60ntVYZQ445qdGrgfd-qqf_YE0DTt-FtHndfZ4-7uOjaXjp6XpahB_DezCMuz_1DQvY9pL7fMa1kCUoqlGbkZxZQvEUDsfR3Tvclf/s750/hal.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>&lt;strong>1. Proposal Goals&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The European Commission&amp;rsquo;s proposal for an AI Liability Directive, published on September 28, 2022, alongside an updated Product Liability Directive, aims to address the risks posed by artificial intelligence (AI) while acknowledging its potential benefits. The proposal stems from a report recognizing the potential harm AI systems can cause due to their connectivity, unpredictable nature, and opacity, which makes it difficult to assign responsibility for AI-related incidents.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To tackle these challenges, the AI Liability Directive seeks to provide legal protection for victims of AI-related harm comparable to victims of harm caused by other products. It aims to build trust in AI technologies, promote their adoption, and harmonize the EU&amp;rsquo;s legal landscape for AI. This legislation will work in conjunction with other AI regulations, such as the proposed AI Act, to create a comprehensive legal framework for AI liability within the EU.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>2. Scope of the AI Liability Directive&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Contrary to its name, the proposed AI Liability Directive doesn&amp;rsquo;t introduce new grounds for civil liability beyond what national laws already cover, except for cases related to defective products under the Product Liability Directive. Instead, it establishes rules for disclosing evidence and presumptions of causality in cases where fault-based liability arises from the use of an AI system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to the complexity of AI systems, proving fault in such cases can be difficult and costly, potentially disadvantaging individuals harmed by AI systems. To address this, the directive focuses on:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>(a)&lt;/strong> Mandating the disclosure of evidence related to high-risk AI systems to help claimants establish fault-based civil liability claims for damages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>(b)&lt;/strong> Shifting the burden of proof in fault-based civil liability claims related to AI system-caused damages brought before national courts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While the directive doesn&amp;rsquo;t directly apply to risk-based liability claims, the proposed Product Liability Directive includes similar rules for evidence disclosure and burden of proof.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The scope of the AI Liability Directive is partially limited to &amp;ldquo;high-risk AI systems,&amp;rdquo; as defined by the proposed AI Act. The AI Act categorizes AI systems based on their risk level, with high-risk systems either being subject to third-party assessment under existing sectoral legislation or identified as high-risk due to their application in specific areas like transportation or education. The directive&amp;rsquo;s rules on evidence disclosure solely apply to these high-risk AI systems, while its rules on the burden of proof extend to claims concerning all types of AI systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>3. Disclosures and Presumptions Under the AI Liability Directive&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>3.1 Rebuttable Presumption of a Causal Link&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Article 4 of the directive introduces a &amp;ldquo;rebuttable presumption of a causal link&amp;rdquo; in fault-based liability cases. This means courts can assume a causal relationship between the defendant&amp;rsquo;s fault and the output (or lack thereof) of an AI system if three conditions are met: the fault (breach of duty of care under EU or national law) is established, it is highly likely that this fault influenced the AI system&amp;rsquo;s output, and damage caused by an AI system is demonstrated. The directive further distinguishes between providers and users of AI systems in subsequent paragraphs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This presumption of a causal link concerning high-risk AI systems can be challenged if the defendant proves that sufficient evidence and expertise are reasonably accessible for the claimant to prove the causal link themselves. For non-high-risk AI systems, this presumption only applies when proving the causal link is deemed excessively difficult for the claimant by the national court. Regardless of the type of AI system, the defendant retains the right to refute any presumption regarding the causal link.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>3.2 Disclosure of Evidence&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Article 3 of the directive outlines the conditions for disclosing evidence related to high-risk AI systems suspected of causing harm, establishing a rebuttable presumption of non-compliance if such evidence is withheld.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This provision empowers courts to order the disclosure of relevant evidence about the specific high-risk AI system in question. However, this disclosure isn&amp;rsquo;t absolute and is subject to a proportionality assessment, considering the legitimate interests of all parties involved, including the protection of trade secrets and confidential information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The directive emphasizes striking a balance between the claimant&amp;rsquo;s right to access information and the need to safeguard sensitive information. National courts are granted the authority to implement measures protecting trade secrets during and after proceedings, ensuring a fair trial for all while preserving the confidentiality of sensitive information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>4. Commentary&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The EU&amp;rsquo;s effort to level the playing field between individuals and AI system developers by addressing the information asymmetry is commendable. Holding developers liable and ensuring compensation can encourage them to prioritize the safe and responsible development of AI systems. This directive, along with the Product Liability Directive, the proposed AI Act, and other product safety regulations, represents a comprehensive approach to regulating AI systems and their potential risks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the AI Liability Directive has a critical flaw: it offers defendants a way to sidestep evidence disclosure. If they refuse to disclose trade secret information about their AI system, a presumption of non-compliance with their duty of care arises. This creates a loophole where defendants might choose to pay compensation to avoid disclosing sensitive information, potentially prioritizing financial considerations over transparency and accountability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This contradicts the AI Act&amp;rsquo;s push for transparency in high-risk AI systems. By offering a way to circumvent transparency, the AI Liability Directive undermines the AI Act&amp;rsquo;s objectives, creating tension between these two instruments. The European Commission missed an opportunity to establish a clear stance on transparency by extending the AI Act&amp;rsquo;s transparency requirements to the AI Liability Directive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This lack of mandatory transparency carries another disadvantage. When developers can avoid disclosing crucial information by paying compensation, the incentive to improve AI systems diminishes. This lack of transparency could hinder innovation in the field and erode public trust in AI technologies. The current approach might ultimately impede the development and refinement of safer, more reliable AI systems.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Do crime victims now have additional rights under EU law?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/do-crime-victims-now-have-additional-rights-under-eu-law/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jun 2024 07:46:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/do-crime-victims-now-have-additional-rights-under-eu-law/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjsdQ19lFVLC1e8iaYoGQAVIS6W6PN2_Tl0DZK-ZGslWOY3H27hwLhCQyAdWtYjEIi_WClGinuZ-vWY8_9EYi5hkyLnmNeK-iPF9i0_T5XbQCe2vBc1r9tRjzMAqRBop48qD-XHv_kYXTc/s1600/burglary.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

To tackle this issue, the EU introduced a &lt;a class="link" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2012:315:0057:0073:EN:PDF" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>Applicable to ‘criminal proceedings’ as defined by national law, the CJEU, in &lt;em>&lt;a class="link" href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?pro=&amp;amp;nat=or&amp;amp;oqp=&amp;amp;dates=&amp;amp;lg=&amp;amp;language=en&amp;amp;jur=C%2CT%2CF&amp;amp;cit=none%252CC%252CCJ%252CR%252C2008E%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252Ctrue%252Cfalse%252Cfalse&amp;amp;td=%3BALL&amp;amp;pcs=Oor&amp;amp;avg=&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;mat=or&amp;amp;parties=katz&amp;amp;jge=&amp;amp;for=&amp;amp;cid=261016" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Katz&lt;/a>&lt;/em>, confirmed its inclusion of private prosecutions. However, the CJEU also determined (in &lt;strong>&lt;em>&lt;a class="link" href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;amp;docid=109603&amp;amp;pageIndex=0&amp;amp;doclang=en&amp;amp;mode=lst&amp;amp;dir=&amp;amp;occ=first&amp;amp;part=1&amp;amp;cid=261016" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>and &lt;em>Salmeron Sanchez&lt;/em>&lt;/a>)&lt;/strong> that it did not harmonize substantive criminal law, such as laws concerning domestic violence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At its core, the Framework Decision advocated for ‘respect and recognition’ for victims of crime, requiring every Member State to guarantee that victims have a ‘real and appropriate role in its criminal legal system’, that they ‘are treated with due respect for the dignity of the individual during proceedings’ and that they ‘recognise the rights and legitimate interests of victims’. For ‘particularly vulnerable victims’, there was an obligation to provide ‘specific treatment best suited to their circumstances’. Member States also had to allow victims to present evidence while minimizing unnecessary questioning. In essence, these measures aimed to ensure that the ‘most vulnerable’ victims could testify in a way that shielded them from the potential harm of giving evidence in open court, using methods aligned with national legal principles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the well-known &lt;em>&lt;a class="link" href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?pro=&amp;amp;nat=or&amp;amp;oqp=&amp;amp;dates=&amp;amp;lg=&amp;amp;language=en&amp;amp;jur=C%2CT%2CF&amp;amp;cit=none%252CC%252CCJ%252CR%252C2008E%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252Ctrue%252Cfalse%252Cfalse&amp;amp;td=%3BALL&amp;amp;pcs=Oor&amp;amp;avg=&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;mat=or&amp;amp;parties=pupino&amp;amp;jge=&amp;amp;for=&amp;amp;cid=261016" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Pupino&lt;/a>&lt;/em> judgment, involving very young children allegedly abused in a nursery by their teacher, the CJEU unsurprisingly ruled that such victims should be categorized as ‘vulnerable’ according to the Framework Decision. This left the broader question of whether all minors should be considered ‘vulnerable’ unanswered. The judgment concluded that these victims were entitled to the safeguards of a special procedure where they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to testify in court, provided it didn&amp;rsquo;t contradict the right to a fair trial. However, in the later &lt;a class="link" href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?pro=&amp;amp;nat=or&amp;amp;oqp=&amp;amp;dates=&amp;amp;lg=&amp;amp;language=en&amp;amp;jur=C%2CT%2CF&amp;amp;cit=none%252CC%252CCJ%252CR%252C2008E%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252Ctrue%252Cfalse%252Cfalse&amp;amp;num=c-507%252F10&amp;amp;td=%3BALL&amp;amp;pcs=Oor&amp;amp;avg=&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;mat=or&amp;amp;jge=&amp;amp;for=&amp;amp;cid=261016" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>judgment&lt;/a> in &lt;em>X&lt;/em>, concerning alleged sexual abuse of a child, the CJEU clarified that this didn’t automatically require using these special procedures if a victim sought them to overrule prosecutors&amp;rsquo; discretion regarding whether or not to initiate proceedings, as granted by national law.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Similarly, in the &lt;em>Katz&lt;/em> case, the Court decided that someone bringing a private prosecution couldn&amp;rsquo;t demand witness status based on the Framework Decision&amp;rsquo;s general nature. Nonetheless, the Framework Decision mandated that they should be able to submit evidence in the proceedings somehow. The Court further explained (in &lt;em>Gueye&lt;/em> and &lt;em>Salmeron Sanchez&lt;/em>) that this right to be heard allowed the victim to describe the events and voice an opinion but not to demand a specific punishment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Framework Decision also outlined victims’ rights to receive information on various aspects, particularly regarding the progression of the criminal proceedings following their complaint and the release of the accused or convicted individual, especially when there could be a threat to the victim. If victims were parties or witnesses, Member States were obligated to take necessary measures to alleviate communication challenges they might encounter (presumably by offering translation and interpretation). However, this fell short of the provisions in the later EU &lt;a class="link" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:280:0001:0007:en:PDF" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Directive&lt;/a> on translation and interpretation for suspects. Member States were also tasked with ensuring the provision of legal and non-legal assistance to victims who are parties to the case. It also suggested that victims who were witnesses or parties could be eligible for reimbursement of expenses. (Compare with the proposal regarding legal aid for suspects, discussed &lt;a class="link" href="http://eulawanalysis.blogspot.co.uk/2015/03/is-eu-coming-to-save-legal-aid-or-to.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Protecting victims’ privacy and safety, particularly from retaliation by the perpetrator, was paramount. This could involve special testimonial procedures, ensuring separation from the offender during court proceedings, and limiting photography of victims in courtrooms. The CJEU, in &lt;em>Gueye&lt;/em> and &lt;em>Salmeron Sanchez&lt;/em>, clarified that these regulations were intended ‘to ensure that the ability of victims adequately to take part in the criminal proceedings is not jeopardised by the possibility that their safety and privacy is placed at risk’. However, a victim&amp;rsquo;s right to privacy didn&amp;rsquo;t imply that they could influence the court&amp;rsquo;s sentencing of offenders, such as demanding a mandatory injunction in domestic violence situations. This was because these clauses in the Framework Decision weren&amp;rsquo;t designed to govern any &lt;em>indirect&lt;/em> consequences on a victim&amp;rsquo;s personal life resulting from the imposition of criminal penalties on offenders.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Member States had to ensure victims could receive a compensation ruling from the offender during criminal proceedings unless alternative compensation avenues existed. Moreover, Member States were responsible for returning a victim’s property not required for the criminal proceedings. The Advocate-General’s &lt;a class="link" href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?language=en&amp;amp;num=C-467/05" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>opinion&lt;/a> in &lt;em>Dell’Orto&lt;/em> suggested that the right to compensation should cover financial losses. It also asserted that any exception to the possibility of securing a compensation decision should be limited to specific instances, typically addressed within the same proceedings that led to the offender’s conviction. Regarding the return of property, the opinion stated that the obligation only applied when property ownership was undisputed or established within the criminal proceedings; otherwise, civil law would govern such matters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Framework Decision also urged Member States to ‘seek to promote penal mediation’ between victims and offenders ‘for offences which it considers appropriate’. The CJEU, in &lt;em>Eredics&lt;/em>, clarified this obligation, stating that Member States had the discretion to determine which offenses qualified for such proceedings. While the need to apply objective criteria when selecting applicable cases might influence this discretion, restricting penal mediation to offenses against individuals, transport safety, or property offenses didn&amp;rsquo;t breach the Framework Decision. Similarly, Member States were permitted to exclude domestic violence cases from penal mediation (&lt;em>Gueye&lt;/em> &lt;em>and&lt;/em> &lt;em>Salmeron Sanchez&lt;/em>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Specific provisions were outlined for victims residing in a different Member State, emphasizing cooperation between Member States. Additionally, Member States were tasked with promoting victim support organizations, training personnel who interact with victims (especially police officers and legal practitioners), and ensuring that victims are protected from intimidation in places like courts and police stations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Commission’s &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/victims/com2004_054en021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>initial report&lt;/a> on the national implementation of most aspects of the Framework Decision criticized the lack of reported national measures fully meeting the specific requirements of the Framework Decision. The Commission’s &lt;a class="link" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0166:FIN:EN:PDF" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>second report&lt;/a> concluded that implementation of the Framework Decision remained ‘not satisfactory’, citing continued inconsistencies, omissions in national laws, and some Member States opting for non-binding methods to implement the Framework Decision.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The 2012 Directive&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As of November 16, 2015, the Directive completely replaced the Framework Decision (except in Denmark, which exercised its opt-out right). Unlike the Framework Decision, which only had indirect effects, the Directive, as confirmed by the CJEU in &lt;em>Pupino&lt;/em>, can directly confer enforceable rights to victims.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, several changes in the new rules generally enhance the level of protection for victims&amp;rsquo; rights. The Directive introduces a provision outlining its objectives, which includes a general requirement for decent and non-discriminatory treatment and a specific general rule concerning child victims (Art 1(2)). The definition of ‘victim’ is expanded to explicitly include family members if a victim dies (Art 2(1)(a); ‘family members’ are defined in Art 2(1)(b)). Entirely new rules regarding a victim’s ‘right to understand and to be understood’ (Art 3) are introduced, followed by significantly expanded rules on a victim’s right to information (Arts 4 to 6; similar to the ‘letter of rights’ &lt;a class="link" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32012L0013" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Directive&lt;/a> for criminal suspects).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Directive solidifies victims’ ‘right to interpretation and translation’, going beyond the ‘communication safeguards’ present in the previous Framework Decision. These rights essentially mirror suspects’ rights to information and translation outlined in the aforementioned EU legislation. Additionally, the Directive establishes a ‘right to access victim support services’, a significant advancement from the rules on ‘specialist services and victim support organisations’ in the Framework Decision. However, the right to be heard for victims remains largely unchanged.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A potentially significant new right for victims is the right to appeal a decision not to prosecute (Art 11). It is important to note that this doesn’t compel all Member States to &lt;em>guarantee&lt;/em> prosecution following every complaint filed by a victim (a principle some Member States already adhere to). While national law determines the ‘procedural rules’ for such appeals, Member States have no discretion regarding the fundamental obligation to provide such review mechanisms or to limit the &lt;em>substantive&lt;/em> grounds that can be cited in such appeals. For example, it should always be possible to argue that a decision not to prosecute was discriminatory, aligning with the obligation to treat victims and address their complaints fairly (Art 1(1)). The preamble (recital 44) suggests that this right also applies ‘where a prosecutor decides to withdraw charges or discontinue proceedings’.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the Directive includes some caveats regarding this right. If, under national law, the victim’s role is established only after a decision not to prosecute, only victims of &lt;em>serious&lt;/em> crimes can appeal this decision (Art 11(2); for the definition of ‘serious’ crime, see recitals 8 and 18 in the preamble). Additionally, this right to appeal doesn&amp;rsquo;t extend to decisions made by courts (recital 43 in the preamble). This means victims can’t appeal a sentence or early release, although they have the right to be informed about such developments (Art 6). Furthermore, the right to appeal ‘does not concern special procedures, such as proceedings against members of parliament or government, in relation to the exercise of their official position’ (Art 11(5)). Member States can also override the right to appeal if a prosecutor decides not to prosecute following an out-of-court settlement (Art 11(3)).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Procedurally, victims must be promptly informed about their right to appeal ‘without unnecessary delay’ (Art 11(3)). The appeal should typically be handled by an entity separate from the one that decided not to prosecute (recital 43 of the preamble). However, suppose the highest prosecution authority decided not to prosecute, and national law doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow for a review of this decision. In that case, the same authority must review the decision (Art 11(4)). Although not explicitly stated, a court doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily have to conduct the review. However, this interpretation is debatable considering Article 47 of the Charter, which guarantees the right to access a court.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Directive remains silent on the consequences of a successful appeal. However, following the principle of effectiveness of EU law, prosecutors should at least re-examine their initial decision not to prosecute, considering any identified flaws, and issue a new decision based on this re-evaluation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Directive mandates safeguards for restorative justice services, replacing the previous rules on ‘penal mediation’ (Art 12; this renders the case law on penal mediation obsolete). However, some provisions (Arts 13-19) are essentially unchanged: the right to legal aid; the right to reimbursement of expenses; the right to the return of property; the right to a decision on compensation from the offender; the rights of victims resident in another Member State; the general right to protection; and the right to avoid contact with the offender.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Directive also introduces several changes to other important provisions: expanded rules on the protection of victims during criminal investigations (covering interviews, legal assistance, and medical examinations) (Art 20); further elaboration on victims’ right to privacy (Art 21); substantial expansion of the provisions concerning victims with ‘specific protection needs’ (Arts 22-24); expanded provisions on practitioner training (Art 25); expanded rules on cooperation between the authorities of Member States (Art 26(1)); and new provisions requiring Member States to raise awareness among victims about their rights (Art 26(2)).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Compared to its predecessor, the Directive boasts stronger legal implications and strengthens victims’ rights in several areas: non-discrimination; the ‘right to understand and to be understood’; the right to access information; the ‘right to interpretation and translation’; the ‘right to access victim support services’; the right to appeal a decision not to prosecute; safeguards in restorative justice services; protection of victims during criminal investigations; the right to privacy of victims; and provisions for victims with ‘specific protection needs’, including victims of hate crimes. Assuming it is thoroughly and correctly implemented, the Directive holds the potential to significantly contribute to protecting crime victims&amp;rsquo; rights across the EU.&lt;/p>

This allows providers to bypass fees associated with leasing traditional copper phone lines, leading to more attractive bundled packages for customers. Theoretically, the internet&amp;rsquo;s capacity should easily accommodate low-bandwidth voice data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, this isn&amp;rsquo;t always the case in reality. Internet paths, much like highways, can become congested, leading to bandwidth constraints, transmission delays (latency), and dropped data packets, all of which disrupt real-time communication like phone calls.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The primary bottleneck often lies in the &amp;ldquo;first mile,&amp;rdquo; the connection between a user and their provider&amp;rsquo;s network. Shared bandwidth services like DSL and cable internet don&amp;rsquo;t guarantee consistent quality or availability, resulting in fluctuating performance and dropped calls.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While budget-conscious consumers might tolerate such inconsistencies, businesses prioritize reliable communication to avoid customer dissatisfaction and disruptions. Negative experiences with VoIP have led some businesses to avoid internet-based phone systems entirely, while others have found solutions combining the advantages of both traditional and internet phone systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Successful businesses often achieve this by limiting their internet usage to non-time-sensitive tasks like web browsing, email, and data exchange. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessitate outdated phone systems and analog lines. There are two primary methods to benefit from VoIP without compromising quality:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Hybrid PBX Systems:&lt;/strong> These systems utilize IP-based phones and switches within a company&amp;rsquo;s internal network, allowing for the use of a single Ethernet LAN for both data and voice communication. This requires careful network design to ensure smooth voice data transmission but eliminates the need for separate phone lines and their associated maintenance costs. External communication is then handled via traditional phone lines connected to the IP PBX.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>SIP Trunking:&lt;/strong> This involves a dedicated line connecting a company&amp;rsquo;s IP PBX directly to their VoIP provider. This dedicated line, often shared with internet data, ensures voice data quality by bypassing the public internet and connecting directly to the public telephone network via the provider. This guarantees consistent bandwidth availability and avoids competition with other internet users.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Both approaches prioritize quality and control by either connecting directly to the public phone network on-site or through a dedicated connection to the provider. This avoids the unpredictable nature of the public internet.&lt;/p>

Second, a client&amp;rsquo;s Dynamics GP SQL server crashes, you rebuild it, and restore databases from backups.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Both scenarios present a common problem: restoring a database from one SQL Server to another doesn&amp;rsquo;t transfer the associated SQL Server logins.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Scenario 1 offers a solution: a &amp;ldquo;Capture Logins&amp;rdquo; script (KB 878449) efficiently transfers SQL logins to the new server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, Scenario 2 becomes trickier if this script isn&amp;rsquo;t regularly used. You&amp;rsquo;re left with a fresh SQL Server lacking logins, and databases containing unconnected users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This inconvenience can be addressed by a system stored procedure encountered while studying for the SQL 2008 exam:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>sp_change_users_login @Action='Report';&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This procedure, proving useful beyond exam preparation, identifies orphaned users. In a real-world scenario where a rebuilt SQL server required login reconstruction, this command efficiently listed orphaned users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While comparing SQL logins and database users is possible, this command offers a simpler approach. Security-conscious clients may also find it valuable for identifying and removing orphaned users to maintain database integrity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This highlights a valuable, practical SQL exam takeaway applicable to Dynamics GP environments.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: A New Arrival From Massachusetts - First Look</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-a-new-arrival-from-massachusetts-first-look/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jun 2024 19:14:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-a-new-arrival-from-massachusetts-first-look/</guid><description>&lt;p>A Beogram 4000 turntable arrived from a Massachusetts customer for a complete restoration. Thankfully, it was properly packaged and arrived without damage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The turntable&amp;rsquo;s dust cover shows typical signs of use, but it will be replaced with a new one. The aluminum surfaces are in good shape overall.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, there are some minor flaws. The keypad has a corner ding, suggesting it might have come loose during past transportation. Additionally, there are small scratches on the aluminum, possibly from the keypad moving around.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While the arm cover has some scuffs, the lettering is well-preserved, which is a positive sign. The plinth is in excellent condition, with sharp, undamaged corners.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Internally, the turntable appears to be mostly original, showing few signs of previous repairs. This is encouraging for the restoration process. The red carriage position marker is also in good condition.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As expected, the solenoid-actuated switch terminals show oxidation and signs of past attempts to fix them. These terminals will be cleaned, straightened, and plated with nickel and gold for long-term durability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Initial testing showed promising results. The carriage moved correctly, the solenoid activated at the LP setdown point, and the strobe light functioned properly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In conclusion, this Beogram 4000 restoration appears to be straightforward. The turntable is expected to be fully restored to its original appearance and functionality. Updates will follow as the process progresses.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Clarification on Dual Citizens and EU Citizenship by the ECJ</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/clarification-on-dual-citizens-and-eu-citizenship-by-the-ecj/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jun 2024 16:08:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/clarification-on-dual-citizens-and-eu-citizenship-by-the-ecj/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhRwto_xq2c0cuPQyXe6KEENusZeVzlTKY0M_PGBcLWiutQ_XjEgojoNs_N8fG4c-GgWehSUPYGYy33sXo3Y13KDI7i3W470Tt9gt0FlYXINC9MuXpCpIVmUbBtSmuW0ZGW2vOTLUT9KC0/s1600/spain&amp;#43;flag.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Professor Steve Peers&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A fundamental principle within EU law concerning the freedom of movement posits that it primarily pertains to EU citizens residing in a Member State different from their home country. Consequently, EU citizens residing in their own Member State cannot generally invoke this law. However, ECJ case law sometimes permits them to assert rights based on their EU citizenship.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This begs the question: what happens to citizens of two Member States? If residing in one of their countries of citizenship, they appear to exist in a legal gray area. They simultaneously qualify for and are excluded from free movement rights. The ECJ&amp;rsquo;s 2011 ruling in &lt;em>McCarthy&lt;/em> established that a dual UK-Ireland citizen residing in the UK couldn&amp;rsquo;t claim rights based on free movement law or EU citizenship. Yet, this verdict&amp;rsquo;s basis remains unclear – was it solely due to her dual citizenship or because she hadn&amp;rsquo;t moved between Member States?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ECJ&amp;rsquo;s recent judgment in &lt;em>Lounes&lt;/em> provides clarification on this crucial point. The case involved a Spanish citizen who moved to the UK, subsequently obtaining UK citizenship and marrying a non-EU national. Invoking free movement rights for her spouse&amp;rsquo;s residency, she faced opposition from the UK government, which, following &lt;em>McCarthy&lt;/em>, argued that UK law, not EU law, applied, leading to stricter family reunion rules.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ECJ determined that she couldn&amp;rsquo;t utilize free movement rights (including family reunion rules) found within the EU citizens’ Directive as a UK citizen residing in the UK. However, the Court affirmed her ability to invoke EU citizenship based on the Treaties. In this context, she was still considered a Spanish citizen who had relocated within the EU. While Treaty citizenship provisions lack specific family member regulations, the Court emphasized that she deserved equal treatment to those under the Directive, highlighting the injustice of facing harsher conditions than a Spanish citizen who moved to the UK without acquiring citizenship.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Essentially, dual citizens of two Member States moving within the EU constitute another exception to the rule restricting EU citizens from claiming free movement or citizenship rights against their home Member State. They join other exceptions like EU citizens returning home after moving to another Member State (&lt;em>Surinder Singh&lt;/em>), EU citizens engaged in economic activity outside their State of nationality (&lt;em>Carpenter&lt;/em>), and EU citizens residing in their home Member State facing potential expulsion from the EU due to a non-EU parent&amp;rsquo;s expulsion (&lt;em>Ruiz Zambrano&lt;/em>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Court&amp;rsquo;s judgment in &lt;em>Lounes&lt;/em> raises several points of contention. Firstly, does it solely apply if the EU citizen acquired their second nationality after relocating to that Member State? The ruling appears to suggest this, yet denying the same rights to those who acquired it earlier, such as through marriage or birthright, would be illogical. Of course, relocation within the EU remains a prerequisite for invoking EU citizenship rights.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another question arises concerning individuals who relinquished one Member State&amp;rsquo;s citizenship upon acquiring another. The &lt;em>Scholz&lt;/em> case suggests they retain rights, although its decision was grounded in free movement, not citizenship rights.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For dual citizens under the &lt;em>Lounes&lt;/em> ruling, do all rights stemming from the citizens’ directive apply analogously? Acquiring permanent residence presents a particular challenge, as the &lt;em>Alarape&lt;/em> case implied that only those directly covered by the citizens’ Directive could attain it. While this wouldn&amp;rsquo;t apply to Ms. Lounes as a UK citizen, her non-EU spouse&amp;rsquo;s eligibility remains unclear. Notably, &lt;em>Alarape&lt;/em> compared those covered by the EU citizens’ Directive with those under a separate Regulation, not the Treaties. Given the Court&amp;rsquo;s emphasis on the citizens’ Directive&amp;rsquo;s analogous application in &lt;em>Lounes&lt;/em>, the permanent residence rules might still apply.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lastly, post-Brexit implications for dual UK-Member State citizens arise. For pre-Brexit Day movers, the withdrawal agreement&amp;rsquo;s (if any) guarantee of continued ECJ case law application on this matter needs examination, especially since family reunion remains a point of contention between the UK and EU27. For arrivals within a potential transition period, the question becomes whether the agreement also guarantees the full application of EU laws and case law. For those arriving post-transition, any UK commitments on this issue and the potential application of solely UK law, with stricter family reunion rules, require consideration. Absent a UK-EU27 agreement on this, the UK&amp;rsquo;s more restrictive rules would apply unless altered by subsequent elections. Notably, UK citizens residing in Spain currently can&amp;rsquo;t acquire Spanish nationality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Individuals with dual nationalities seeking a life with a third-country national expose the stark contrast between immigration law&amp;rsquo;s rigidity and the human need for family unity. Only time will tell if Brexit will unravel the unions that EU law has brought together.&lt;/p>

However, as a small business owner, independent sales agent, or consultant, you are responsible for managing your own image. One important aspect of this is your business card.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The design and printing of your business card contribute to a polished and professional look, but an unprofessional email address can quickly ruin that impression. Using a generic free email address might be acceptable for personal use, but for a professional, it appears amateurish. Instead, opt for an email address that uses your company&amp;rsquo;s domain name, such as &lt;a class="link" href="mailto:yourname@yourcompany.com" >yourname@yourcompany.com&lt;/a>. This not only looks more professional but is also easier for clients to remember and associate with your business. It demonstrates that you take your business seriously. Consider using a domain name service with email forwarding if you prefer to use your personal email address for business correspondence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A professional email address is affordable, often costing less than $10 per year for a .com, .net, or .org domain name. Ideally, your domain name should match your company name or be closely related. This registration often includes domain name forwarding for your website.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even if your business primarily operates offline, having a website is essential. It acts as a digital brochure, providing contact information and outlining your products or services. With additional effort, your website can become an online sales platform, allowing customers to place orders outside of business hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While free website options exist, it&amp;rsquo;s generally best to avoid them, with a few exceptions. If you represent a company that provides agent websites, these are usually professionally designed and integrated with your agent ID. However, the URLs for these sites are often lengthy and unattractive. This is where URL forwarding is beneficial. By forwarding your purchased domain name to this website, you can direct clients to a professional-looking URL like &lt;a class="link" href="http://yourcompany.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>http://yourcompany.com&lt;/a> instead of the lengthy, default one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another exception to avoiding free websites is a blog. Google&amp;rsquo;s Blogger service offers a free platform where the design and tools are already in place. You only need to focus on creating content. Regularly updating your blog with industry insights or offers keeps it relevant and engaging. If time or budget constraints have prevented you from creating a website, a blog is an accessible and easy-to-manage alternative.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, consider using a toll-free business number. It enhances your professional image and makes it more convenient for potential customers to contact you without incurring call charges. Services like Kall8 offer affordable toll-free numbers for a low monthly fee plus the cost of calls.&lt;/p>

The transition to this modern technology eliminates the need for separate phone and computer networks and allows businesses to move their internal switching system to the cloud. Moreover, switching to IP phones unlocks a wider array of features, often referred to as Unified Communications (UC).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ShorTel, a recognized leader in business communications, is widely used by companies of all sizes. Notably, ShorTel also leads in UC with its ShorTel Connect CLOUD service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s crucial to understand that ShorTel Connect CLOUD is a fully hosted and managed communications solution that removes the burden of phone system management while introducing new features such as instant messaging, video conferencing, desktop sharing, and conference calling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Furthermore, it allows for integration with Customer Relationship Management (CRM) applications like Salesforce and NetSuite, boosting employee efficiency. Automation, a core capability of Unified Communications, presents a compelling reason to upgrade from traditional analog and VoIP systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cloud-based UC offers additional efficiency advantages. Instead of upfront capital expenditures, businesses opt for a pay-as-you-go monthly billing model based on the number of users. While this might seem like an even trade-off at first, it becomes particularly beneficial when scaling up or down operations. Adding new employees simply requires adding more users to the existing system without significant capital investments in a new PBX mainframe. Similarly, during economic downturns, resources can be easily adjusted to align with a smaller organizational structure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These arguments are analogous to those used for cloud computing, and for a valid reason: the cloud functions similarly regardless of the hosted application. Essentially, voice communication becomes another application on the cloud, with the critical distinction that real-time audio and video streams necessitate special prioritization to ensure quality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reliability and security are paramount concerns with cloud-based systems. ShorTel addresses this by delivering enterprise-grade performance backed by robust Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and easily accessible customer support as part of its managed service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If your business phone system feels restrictive and you&amp;rsquo;re seeking productivity gains and cost savings through cloud-hosted Unified Communications, explore what ShoreTel Connected CLOUD can offer.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Izabella Majcher&lt;/strong>, PhD in International Law; Senior Legal Officer, ECRE*&lt;/p>
&lt;p>*The views expressed in the post are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the position of ECRE &lt;/p>
&lt;p>In December 2020, the European Parliament issued a Resolution regarding the implementation of the Return Directive (a 2008 directive concerning the rules for returning undocumented migrants). This Resolution resulted from the European Commission&amp;rsquo;s failure to assess the Directive&amp;rsquo;s implementation, a task they were supposed to perform every three years starting in 2013. The Commission only conducted this evaluation once in 2014, yet proceeded to offer guidance on the Directive&amp;rsquo;s execution and even suggested a revised version.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Both the Parliament&amp;rsquo;s Resolution and the Commission&amp;rsquo;s Recommendation provide guidance to member states on implementing the Return Directive. Despite the Commission&amp;rsquo;s Recommendation potentially carrying more legal weight, both are considered non-binding &amp;ldquo;interpretive soft law acts.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s important to analyze the content of these documents and consider the broader context of international law. The EU&amp;rsquo;s return policy must align with international human rights obligations, which are outlined in various conventions that all EU member states have ratified. These norms informed the UN Special Rapporteur on the Human Rights of Migrants&amp;rsquo; recommendations on returning or expelling migrants.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post compares key aspects of the Parliament&amp;rsquo;s Resolution and the Commission&amp;rsquo;s Recommendation, examining them in light of international norms and standards.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>1) Defining Return Effectiveness&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since the 2015 refugee crisis, the Commission has primarily gauged the effectiveness of return policies based on the return rate (the ratio of return decisions to actual returns). This narrow focus on return rate, which the Commission deems insufficient, has driven them to propose policies and legal measures that potentially restrict human rights. In contrast, the Parliament provides a more comprehensive view of effectiveness, suggesting that it should encompass the sustainability of returns, upholding fundamental rights, adherence to procedural guarantees, and the success of voluntary return programs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>2) Applying the Directive at Borders&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Directive includes provisions allowing states to bypass certain rules for individuals apprehended while crossing borders irregularly. While this exception includes safeguards, concerns remain about its potential for broad interpretation, reduced legal certainty due to parallel procedures, and limitations on protective measures at borders. While the Commission encourages using this exception to enhance effectiveness, the Parliament stresses that it might weaken safeguards and advocates for the Directive&amp;rsquo;s full application in border situations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>3) Return Decisions&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Directive mandates issuing a return decision for anyone in an irregular situation, with few exceptions. International human rights law emphasizes the principle of &lt;em>non-refoulement&lt;/em> (not returning individuals to situations of danger) and the right to family and private life as key factors in return decisions.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Non-refoulement&lt;/strong>: While the Commission suggests forgoing &lt;em>non-refoulement&lt;/em> assessments if already conducted in other procedures, the Parliament asserts that this principle applies unconditionally. Importantly, asylum procedures, often cited by the Commission, don&amp;rsquo;t substitute for comprehensive &lt;em>non-refoulement&lt;/em> evaluations.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Returning Unaccompanied Minors&lt;/strong>: Although the Commission supports returning unaccompanied minors, highlighting potential negative consequences if not returned, the Parliament emphasizes that such returns should only occur if demonstrably in the child&amp;rsquo;s best interests.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Right to Appeal&lt;/strong>: Regarding appeals against return decisions, the Commission advocates for short deadlines, while the Parliament prioritizes guaranteeing sufficient time for individuals to exercise their right to an effective remedy.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>4) Regularization&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The UN Special Rapporteur recommends offering protection from return to individuals who need it and suggests regularization pathways for those with established ties or facing risks upon return. While the Directive allows granting residency permits, potentially providing a solution for non-returnable individuals, the Commission emphasizes that states aren&amp;rsquo;t obligated to do so. The Parliament, however, encourages expanding this provision to address protracted situations and uphold fundamental rights.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>5) Encouraged (&amp;ldquo;Voluntary&amp;rdquo;) Departure&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Directive emphasizes providing individuals with the option to leave voluntarily rather than facing deportation. This practice, termed &amp;ldquo;voluntary departure,&amp;rdquo; is sometimes referred to as &amp;ldquo;mandatory departure&amp;rdquo; because it may not be genuinely voluntary.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Departure Timeframe&lt;/strong>: The Directive outlines a departure period between 7 and 30 days, extendable in certain cases. While the Commission encourages the shortest possible timeframe, the Parliament highlights the Directive&amp;rsquo;s flexibility and the importance of adequate time for departure.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Denying Voluntary Departure&lt;/strong>: The Directive outlines specific situations where voluntary departure might be denied or shortened. However, the Commission misinterprets these exceptions as mandatory, while the Parliament correctly identifies them as exceptions to the general rule, aligning with the Court of Justice&amp;rsquo;s interpretation.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>6) Detention&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Directive allows detaining individuals slated for return under specific circumstances but emphasizes detention safeguards and proportionality.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Using Detention&lt;/strong>: The Commission prioritizes detention as a tool to boost return system effectiveness, whereas the Parliament stresses its last-resort nature and the importance of necessity, proportionality, and individual assessments, echoing international human rights standards.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Detaining Minors&lt;/strong>: The Commission believes detaining minors should be possible in certain cases, while the Parliament aligns with the UN&amp;rsquo;s stance against detaining children for immigration purposes, advocating for suitable alternatives.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Detention Duration&lt;/strong>: While the Commission views lengthy detention periods (up to the Directive&amp;rsquo;s maximum limit) as potentially enhancing return effectiveness, the Parliament highlights the lack of automatic correlation and underscores the importance of minimizing detention duration.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>7) Re-Entry Bans&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Directive links re-entry bans to return decisions, particularly when individuals don&amp;rsquo;t leave within the voluntary departure timeframe. However, these bans should be proportionate and based on individual assessments.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Imposing and Lifting Re-entry Bans&lt;/strong>: While the Commission highlights situations necessitating re-entry bans, the Parliament emphasizes individual assessments over automatic application. Moreover, the Parliament calls for flexibility in lifting bans, particularly for humanitarian reasons, family reunification, or when individuals&amp;rsquo; circumstances change (e.g., needing international protection).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Re-entry Bans with Voluntary Departure&lt;/strong>: The Commission acknowledges that imposing re-entry bans even after voluntary departure might discourage compliance and encourages careful management. The Parliament suggests that this practice contradicts the purpose of encouraging voluntary departure and recommends lifting bans for those who comply.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>8) Monitoring Post-Return&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Given reports of returnees facing abuse and mistreatment, international organizations have called for post-return monitoring. The UN Special Rapporteur emphasizes the need for independent oversight mechanisms. Despite this, the Commission maintains that monitoring mandates don&amp;rsquo;t extend beyond the return process itself. Conversely, the Parliament urges the Commission to establish a post-return monitoring system, share best practices, and allocate adequate funding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Final Thoughts&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Parliament&amp;rsquo;s Resolution offers valuable guidance on implementing the Return Directive while upholding human rights. It emphasizes a comprehensive view of effectiveness, moving beyond return rates to consider sustainability and rights compliance. The Resolution challenges several problematic aspects of the Commission&amp;rsquo;s approach, aligning with international norms and standards for returning and expelling individuals. Notably, the Parliament advocates for applying the Directive in border contexts, promoting regularization for those ineligible for return, and establishing a post-return monitoring mechanism. By integrating these recommendations, the Parliament demonstrates a commitment to a more humane and rights-respecting EU return policy that aligns with international obligations. The Resolution is particularly relevant in light of ongoing discussions about EU asylum and migration policies, serving as a potential blueprint for future legislation and signaling a commitment to upholding the rights of all individuals, regardless of their migration status.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Connection that's Missing: The Impact of Direct Effect, CETA/TTIP, and Investor-State Dispute Settlement</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-connection-that-s-missing-the-impact-of-direct-effect-ceta-ttip-and-investor-state-dispute-settlement/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jun 2024 03:49:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-connection-that-s-missing-the-impact-of-direct-effect-ceta-ttip-and-investor-state-dispute-settlement/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhCzU_JF6_CDE7o_wOBU8AtfyoQ_Dx-CVtpc9QsXOZFWP_w3Pt0UoPf88bN8FP6o-0TZnjPtHYxpVeon1kDx00M0v20OSxkj8lpXS6qRMOGCEmiU3meLXylCV4Mrn1ysjUN8Zp5xF6JLF8/s1600/ttip.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>By Daniel Thym, Chair of Public, European and International Law, University of Konstanz&lt;/p>
&lt;p>International trade agreements, particularly the proposed deals between the EU and the US (TTIP) and Canada (CETA), have garnered significant public interest. However, many legal professionals and students lack familiarity with this area of law and often apply domestic legal concepts to the international arena. For instance, there&amp;rsquo;s an assumption that national courts can enforce international trade rules and that companies can challenge state actions under these agreements in domestic courts. This post clarifies that this is not the case by focusing on Article 14.14 of the Draft CETA, a provision often overlooked in discussions. This article highlights that the impact of these trade agreements might be less significant than perceived.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="understanding-ceta-and-ttip-as-international-eu-agreements">Understanding CETA and TTIP as International EU Agreements&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To grasp the significance of Article 14.14, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to recognize that these trade agreements would largely bind EU Member States as part of EU law. Although some argue that these agreements overstep the EU&amp;rsquo;s authority, the treaties clearly indicate the EU&amp;rsquo;s competence in this domain, particularly in areas like foreign direct investment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Lisbon Treaty clarified and consolidated the EU&amp;rsquo;s authority in international trade after years of debate. This move was acknowledged by the German Federal Constitutional Court, which recognized the EU&amp;rsquo;s exclusive power in shaping international trade agreements. However, some uncertainties persist regarding the limits of the EU&amp;rsquo;s competence in related trade aspects. Therefore, many national governments propose that CETA and TTIP should be &amp;ldquo;mixed agreements,&amp;rdquo; requiring approval from both the EU and individual member states. Despite this, EU law would still govern matters falling under the Common Commercial Policy.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="domestic-application-of-eu-agreements">Domestic Application of EU Agreements&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The dominance of EU law can obscure the distinct nature of international law. While EU law is directly applicable in domestic courts, the same cannot be assumed for international law, even for agreements concluded by the EU. Although the European Court of Justice (ECJ) asserts that international agreements can have direct effect within the EU legal framework, this is not automatic. A prime example is the ECJ&amp;rsquo;s ruling preventing Member States from mandating language proficiency for spouses of Turkish nationals, based on an interpretation of the Association Agreement with Turkey. This case exemplifies the potential impact of direct effect on non-tariff barriers to trade, a central concern in CETA and TTIP.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the ECJ might not automatically grant direct effect to these trade deals. The court considers factors like the agreement&amp;rsquo;s purpose, the intent of the parties involved, and reciprocity (whether the EU would be the only party recognizing direct effect). While reciprocity might have been less emphasized in agreements with neighboring countries, it plays a key role in evaluating trade liberalization agreements.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="article-1414-of-the-ceta-draft-treaty">Article 14.14 of the CETA Draft Treaty&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Given the potential implications of direct effect, Article 14.14 of the CETA Draft Agreement holds significant weight. This article explicitly states that CETA does not grant rights or impose obligations on individuals beyond those established under international law. Crucially, it prevents the agreement from being directly invoked in the domestic legal systems of the participating parties.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This effectively denies direct effect for CETA. Neither the ECJ nor national courts can enforce CETA rules in domestic cases or invalidate conflicting national legislation. CETA and TTIP would be treated similarly to WTO law, which lacks direct effect within the EU and its member states. This means that even if the WTO finds EU legislation incompatible with its rules, domestic courts cannot use this ruling directly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This lack of direct effect presents challenges, especially for eliminating non-tariff barriers to trade, as the rules are often broadly defined. Without direct enforcement mechanisms, the effectiveness of vaguely worded provisions relies heavily on the continued commitment of the parties involved and the availability of control mechanisms.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="implications-for-investor-state-dispute-settlement">Implications for Investor-State Dispute Settlement&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Considering Article 14.14, the debate about investor-state dispute settlement mechanisms in CETA and TTIP requires reevaluation. Critics might view the absence of direct application as preferential treatment for investors, while supporters might argue that these mechanisms compensate for the lack of direct legal remedies in domestic courts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ultimately, the focus should be on whether special rules for investors are desirable. While these might be less critical in agreements with the US and Canada, abandoning them could complicate negotiations with countries where trust is lower.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The absence of direct effect highlights that CETA and TTIP do not signify EU-style integration through law. Domestic courts lack the authority to overturn national or EU legislation that contradicts these agreements, a power also explicitly denied to dispute settlement bodies. This aligns the dispute settlement mechanisms more with inter-state negotiations, mirroring the WTO framework.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The lack of direct application underscores that CETA and TTIP will not lead to direct enforcement of transatlantic trade rules within domestic legal systems.

&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;[The plans were] on display in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying, &amp;lsquo;Beware of the Leopard&amp;rsquo;!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Arthur Dent, &lt;em>The Hitch-Hiker&amp;rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The EU&amp;rsquo;s activities often spark debate. Examples include the trade negotiations with the USA (TTIP), regulations covering diverse products like vacuum cleaners and genetically modified food, and the oversight (or in some cases, control) of Member States&amp;rsquo; financial decisions. While someone will always be dissatisfied with the final decisions made on these issues, there&amp;rsquo;s a longstanding concern about the lack of transparency in the EU&amp;rsquo;s decision-making process. This lack of transparency has undoubtedly fueled a broader perception that the EU lacks legitimacy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 2001, the EU attempted to address this issue by implementing a Regulation regarding access to documents created or held by the Commission, Council, and European Parliament. Although attempts to modify this legislation have been unsuccessful, extensive case law from EU courts has shaped its practical application.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This case law presents both positive and problematic aspects. Fortunately, a recent significant ruling by the EU&amp;rsquo;s General Court in the &lt;em>Mastercard&lt;/em> case falls into the positive category. The Court decided in favor of granting access to background documents prepared by consultants for EU decision-making, thereby significantly increasing transparency in the EU&amp;rsquo;s decision-making processes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Mastercard Judgment&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mastercard requested access from the Commission to background documents prepared by a consultant (EIM) that were part of a report on the impact of costs and benefits for retailers accepting different payment methods. The Commission denied access, arguing that no decision had been made on the relevant issues (&amp;lsquo;decision-making&amp;rsquo; exception) and that the documents contained information about the consultant&amp;rsquo;s commercial interests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The General Court refuted both arguments. Firstly, the documents didn&amp;rsquo;t directly pertain to any specific Commission decision-making process regarding EU competition law but provided general economic information. Moreover, the Commission hadn&amp;rsquo;t invoked this exception when initially refusing access. The Court also deemed it irrelevant that the documents were interim, especially since the Commission had shared most of them with stakeholders.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Addressing the second point (commercial interests of the consultant), the Court reaffirmed previous case law stating that the exception applied solely to sensitive information like business strategy and sales figures, not general business information. Applying this to the case, the Court dismissed the Commission&amp;rsquo;s argument that revealing the consultant&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;trial and error&amp;rdquo; process in the draft documents would damage its commercial reputation or expose its methodology to competitors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Consequently, the Commission lost the case, and the documents must be disclosed. However, they have two months to appeal to the Court of Justice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Analyzing the Implications&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While much of the case law on access to documents focuses on the Commission, which holds significant administrative and executive power at the EU level (except in certain external relations aspects), this case highlights the Commission&amp;rsquo;s reliance on external expertise. The case isn&amp;rsquo;t an anomaly but rather reflects a common practice: numerous Commission impact assessments and reports depend on reports prepared by external consultants. The European Parliament also utilizes this practice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Therefore, anyone seeking to understand the Commission&amp;rsquo;s decision-making or the broader development of EU policies – including journalists, researchers, NGOs, or businesses like Mastercard – needs access to these consultant reports. They offer valuable insights and analysis that play a crucial role in understanding the Commission&amp;rsquo;s final proposals, reports, and impact assessments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Typically, the Commission publishes the consultant reports that underpin its documents. So, what difference will this judgment make? First, it might accelerate public access to these reports. More importantly, it will expand access to other background documents prepared by consultants for the Commission.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Personally, I&amp;rsquo;ve served as an advisor to consultancies preparing reports for the Commission on several impact assessments. While confidentiality agreements prevent me from disclosing specifics (and I should clarify that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t involved in the Mastercard case), I can attest that it&amp;rsquo;s standard practice for consultancies to produce interim reports and other background documents not always attached to the final impact assessment report.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Consultants and advisors like myself also develop drafts and working documents not shared with the Commission, and this judgment won&amp;rsquo;t grant access to those. This is reasonable, as documents the Commission hasn&amp;rsquo;t seen wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have influenced its decision-making process. As a longstanding critic of the EU&amp;rsquo;s access to documents rules, I can only imagine the irony if I were subject to these rules! However, that&amp;rsquo;s not the case.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What practical implications will this judgment have? In essence, it suggests that all background consultancy reports submitted to the Commission should be made public unless other grounds for refusal apply (see the discussion on the &amp;rsquo;external relations&amp;rsquo; exception below). The Court&amp;rsquo;s finding that releasing these documents wouldn&amp;rsquo;t hinder the Commission&amp;rsquo;s decision-making process is universally applicable, as is its ruling regarding the consultant&amp;rsquo;s commercial interests. It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that the consultancy firm didn&amp;rsquo;t intervene in the proceedings, suggesting they weren&amp;rsquo;t concerned about potential harm from disclosing the document. While acknowledging the expertise of EIM and other consultancies, their impact assessment methodology isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly a trade secret like Colonel Sanders&amp;rsquo; recipe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The interim reports and background documents might contain information that further illuminates the analysis in the final report. If there&amp;rsquo;s a valid reason not to rely on these documents, the Commission and/or the consultant can explain this in the final document.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This judgment applies to background consultancy documents across all EU law fields. Businesses, NGOs, journalists, and researchers could leverage it to access potentially valuable documents regardless of their area of interest. Importantly, the Court distinguished this case from previous rulings (relevant to competition and state aid) that allowed the Commission to refuse access to all documents related to specific decisions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Regarding external relations, the judgment&amp;rsquo;s impact is somewhat limited. The &amp;rsquo;external relations&amp;rsquo; exception in the Regulation allows for the refusal of access to details of EU negotiating mandates for treaties like the TTIP. However, it should be possible to redact the negotiating mandate and release the rest of the text.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This increased access to documents raises two crucial questions concerning accessibility and awareness. Firstly, will the Commission make these background documents available, and if so, when? The Mastercard case shows that the Commission did share some documents with &amp;lsquo;stakeholders&amp;rsquo; but not the public. It&amp;rsquo;s likely that the Commission doesn&amp;rsquo;t consult every entity that might be interested in these documents.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Secondly, how will anyone outside the Commission, the consultancy, and specific consultees know these documents exist? Arthur Dent was unaware of the documents concerning his house&amp;rsquo;s demolition, which was merely a prelude to the insufficiently consulted destruction of Earth. An unsettling analogy exists for climate change activists.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Commission appears to have drawn inspiration from this fictional dystopia when designing its access to documents system. When redesigning the Eur-lex system for accessing EU law, the Commission removed the direct link to its access to documents register, a move they even denied.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although the register can still be found through a Google search or by clicking &lt;a class="link" href="http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/access_documents/index_en.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here&lt;/a>, its removal from the Eur-lex page could mean fewer people are aware of its existence. Even if they find it, they might not find the background documents from consultants, given the register&amp;rsquo;s limited scope. The Commission seems to have missed that Douglas Adams was engaging in satire, not offering a blueprint for their access to documents regime.&lt;/p>

Prior testing had shown that the arm carriage would not return to its home position when moved across the platter without a record in place. Instead, it would travel to the center of the platter and stop. Ideally, the carriage should trigger the End Switch (ES) at this point and subsequently return to its home position on the right, turning off the turntable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My initial focus was to ensure the proper operation of the carriage position switches, considering their critical role in the smooth functioning of this model. While not overly complex, I felt a video demonstration of the process would be beneficial to fellow enthusiasts working on this elegant design.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Despite cleaning the switches, the carriage run issue persisted. Upon closer examination, it became apparent that the spring responsible for activating the ES switch was not fully engaging. I removed the spring carrier again and slightly bent the spring downwards to increase the switch travel. This adjustment resolved the problem, enabling the carriage to return to its home position when moved across an empty platter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, further testing revealed a potential issue where the carriage could be manually positioned in a way that would not trigger the ES. This occurred when using the left arrow on the keypad to move the carriage beyond the ES activation point, seemingly overriding the ES function. As a result, the ES would release, preventing the carriage from returning when the arrow key was released.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To address this, I repositioned the ES activation spring slightly to the right on the carrier plate. This adjustment allows the carriage to reach its physical endpoint using the arrow key without moving beyond the ES switch&amp;rsquo;s activation zone.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): New Gold Plated RCA Plugs</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-new-gold-plated-rca-plugs/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jun 2024 01:11:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-new-gold-plated-rca-plugs/</guid><description>&lt;p>Over time, many Beogram devices have developed corroded DIN or RCA plugs. It&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to replace these old connectors with new, gold-plated ones. This specific Beogram 4002 (5513) came with RCA connectors.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I typically use large, modern, high-quality metal plugs for replacements. However, this project had a unique requirement: the Beogram needed to connect to a Beolab 5000. The Beolab 5000 has a compact compartment for its connectors, which creates limitations on plug size.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I chose gold-plated, all-metal Rean plugs that were short enough to fit the Beolab&amp;rsquo;s compartment. However, these plugs, like many others, have oversized cable exits. While this might accommodate the recent trend of using very thick cables, I find this excessive and prefer a cleaner look. To address this, I designed small 3D-printed inserts that would create a more streamlined appearance and provide a way to color-code the plugs.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Following advice from &amp;lsquo;chartz&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;sonavor&amp;rsquo; on Beoworld.org (&lt;a class="link" href="http://forum.beoworld.org/forums/t/9839.aspx?PageIndex=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>link to thread&lt;/a>), I began replacing the belts in my Beocord 5000 (4716), which had become loose and stretched over time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first step is removing the drive mechanism. This involves lifting the left-side board to access the solenoid linkage. As &amp;lsquo;chartz&amp;rsquo; recommended, I secured the operating panel to the enclosure&amp;rsquo;s bottom using three screws in reverse orientation. This clever trick prevents damaging the wires while working with the exposed components. Here&amp;rsquo;s a picture:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhXFPTNf-VhswMi-AB-NqAhyYkntpk8g9G_NHgP1tb2gGqH-d8JKqQt5NHjdIRtd4vhb5-p321-Bx7PPSDaJYx-8kvM0xnGKeXP2dcHcVuAFWlshOea6BQUsxdFCDJXappkmmPvHU76-Ppc/s1600/Key&amp;#43;panel&amp;#43;secured.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, I flipped up the left-side board. This board is secured by two screws: one in the back right corner and another beneath the enclosure next to the red DIN socket. With the screws removed, I carefully shifted the board to the right, disengaging it from the two brackets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Conveniently, there are two upward-facing slots on the brackets where the board can be secured in an upright position. I recommend covering the plexiglass cover with a cloth to prevent scratches, a precaution I hadn&amp;rsquo;t taken in the following picture as I was still learning:&lt;/p>

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With that done, it was time to extract the drive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, I removed the solenoid linkage:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg6EI0f3O5hKsRAOv5POoVT_7wY0IvQzsuUJW44-p62fDiOHI7my_OwG0KriAQIab06HXD9daM81Gtiniw1u_LbGJC21E87nZBNYhJv-M7_pu83KTTy6v9ktx27zvUK3bb3oPWYJ0pSV2yF/s1600/Solenoid&amp;#43;Linkage&amp;#43;with&amp;#43;Retaining&amp;#43;Ring.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg6EI0f3O5hKsRAOv5POoVT_7wY0IvQzsuUJW44-p62fDiOHI7my_OwG0KriAQIab06HXD9daM81Gtiniw1u_LbGJC21E87nZBNYhJv-M7_pu83KTTy6v9ktx27zvUK3bb3oPWYJ0pSV2yF/s1600/Solenoid&amp;#43;Linkage&amp;#43;with&amp;#43;Retaining&amp;#43;Ring.jpg"
loading="lazy"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This required removing the retaining ring from its pivot shaft. I used a retaining ring tool, but it was tricky as the ring sits flush. By gently prying the ring open with the tool and wedging a small screwdriver between the ring and the linkage, I was able to raise the ring enough to get a better grip and remove it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the ring removed, the linkage could be rotated 90 degrees and taken out:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgIPXL9Eh7Yc8ro4y92t1lACyQFGRZtcA61JZdfJ6MQEfuVuePeSUyFGA3ZnXVeiIw-2V8pD85zJhsUzLpgs7vPUyB52ooPbPQGsqy1VdS4vP0gH4v6uzBXp_p53GyD6mVeSWqBR8YTyYXM/s1600/Removing&amp;#43;Linkage.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

loading="lazy"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next step was to disconnect the head plug, ensuring the deck was unplugged to avoid magnetizing the heads. This precaution was advised on a barely visible warning label inside the operating panel - a classic example of how not to design warnings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjXICaeRWiiCe6SWrJZdc3JniKl5t2_b1O3n4yIQWUgNPAUTXbcOo5d6spwWMql5AAHcISNE6N3WF4u42Ywsk4_I6PN4WpOpwKZpmN_xhPCvYmrsne7Rr_z8ARVB8eaIletUhcODlAY5NWM/s1600/Taking&amp;#43;Plug&amp;#43;to&amp;#43;Heads&amp;#43;Out&amp;#43;%28unplug%2Bthe%2BBC%2Bto%2Bavoid%2Bmagnetization%29.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

loading="lazy"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following that, I desoldered the solenoid connections:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhJVtrz6n_ae1peIVNKGo870m4rBmVbciE91QdgZKEQqwg5eW6ZsdgjwdPE6cAgaX4Vuc0ydbPxMofUx1ZFa4kJb-HKbDOAnxCjiaku8o27RMkV3QlANriRl-p6iRyenzjhafTTTAiAhYQe/s1600/Wire&amp;#43;Connections&amp;#43;to&amp;#43;Solenoid.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhJVtrz6n_ae1peIVNKGo870m4rBmVbciE91QdgZKEQqwg5eW6ZsdgjwdPE6cAgaX4Vuc0ydbPxMofUx1ZFa4kJb-HKbDOAnxCjiaku8o27RMkV3QlANriRl-p6iRyenzjhafTTTAiAhYQe/s1600/Wire&amp;#43;Connections&amp;#43;to&amp;#43;Solenoid.jpg"
loading="lazy"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The drive is secured at the front by two screws that go up through the enclosure&amp;rsquo;s bottom into the solenoid bracket. Here&amp;rsquo;s a view from under the enclosure:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjmR4DaOY4s9AyuOweWZvF4nHnrf32LMpauLNr5-b1TAHSMtt5IxZcoUp1kCR8SuI-eUjUK_zU00IR635b4ntfS4NjBUMYIUnwqETO0os9OYqpA3CBliXdSWCc-DnHG4XneUPTrk73TGhSq/s1600/Screws&amp;#43;That&amp;#43;Hold&amp;#43;Solenoid.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

loading="lazy"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I loosened these screws to allow the drive to slide forward.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unlike the front, the drive&amp;rsquo;s rear isn&amp;rsquo;t secured with a screw. Instead, a bracket on the drive slots into the enclosure. By sliding the drive forward, it can be lifted out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The final step involved disconnecting the large wire connector at the back of the drive:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhHM0UdYKqQrWVUFmBjanuJP9EtkuQP8S99qOk59HQxxKdppZPHEKrb1PxddE3DU3LLpz7WqCvED2kSzSR4E4cbX0iEOurY5uAq2ZacX1ZnQVujOXxXAwZ6xbdRWt_E7wFROvTzNrAk_lbj/s1600/IMG_3378.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

loading="lazy"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This connector was quite firmly seated, and I had to carefully pry it loose with a small screwdriver before pulling it downwards. I realized then that removing the plexiglass cover would have made this easier. Finally, it came loose, and the drive was free.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s a picture of the removed drive:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiq4nr2Sv-H540WadCdHoBiWmxGqeLQExR59Z1ihnwOJwwdyx7bFSmmjeuVn6haJRxCM6H0rYSJPH2HPOakjBJf6Jdr1p7BTe29NTOHBaKmHQKTKElIx5e5flAf1CqPJf34tz6w1g41WqRP/s1600/Drive.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And the enclosure without it:&lt;/p>

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That concludes today&amp;rsquo;s work. Next time, I&amp;rsquo;ll begin disassembling the drive mechanism to access the belts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Google Spain ruling by the CJEU: a lack of equilibrium between privacy and freedom of speech</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-google-spain-ruling-by-the-cjeu-a-lack-of-equilibrium-between-privacy-and-freedom-of-speech/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2024 09:32:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-google-spain-ruling-by-the-cjeu-a-lack-of-equilibrium-between-privacy-and-freedom-of-speech/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjRcYn6fwNdGg-LMqz4K16_kkusEWghFTdsSvDV6W5d08MptPAZxFLzA4g5HBxRF5VqJjNtdJC_Iwn3qHrAfCYjJJX1FWd_8i0_OVRD3GhSEiKYqUtijn4_eimHNAW9vFsarWJCatY6-so/s1600/Google-privacy.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By Steve Peers&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The EU&amp;rsquo;s data protection Directive was established in 1995 during the early days of the internet, before the rise of major internet companies. Notably, Google, founded in 1998, emerged just as EU countries were implementing this Directive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Despite its age and ongoing debates surrounding a proposed revision, this legislation still governs the modern internet. Years of debate about the Directive&amp;rsquo;s application to aspects like social media, search engines, and cookies culminated in the CJEU&amp;rsquo;s GoogleSpain judgment, focusing on search engines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The case, as detailed by Lorna Woods, involves a Spanish citizen who wanted to remove an old news article about his financial history from Google&amp;rsquo;s search results. Ironically, this legal challenge might increase awareness of his situation, mirroring the case of Mr. Stauder, whose legal challenge regarding his financial privacy led to the first CJEU ruling on human rights in EU law.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Court’s judgment&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The CJEU focused on four key issues: (a) whether the Directive applies to search engines; (b) whether it applies to Google Spain, given its parent company&amp;rsquo;s location in Silicon Valley; (c) the responsibility of search engine operators; and (d) the concept of the ‘right to be forgotten’ - an individual&amp;rsquo;s right to request information removal from search engine results. Lorna Woods has summarized the ruling, but key points are highlighted below for context.  &lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Material scope&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The CJEU affirmed the Directive&amp;rsquo;s application to search engines. The information in question was &amp;ldquo;personal data,&amp;rdquo; and its online presence constituted &amp;ldquo;processing.&amp;rdquo; Search engines, though utilizing data from third parties, process personal data by &amp;ldquo;collecting,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;retrieving,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;storing,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;disclosing&amp;rdquo; information from the internet, regardless of its origin or alteration. This aligns with the CJEU&amp;rsquo;s previous ruling in the Satamedia case involving tax information published on CD-ROM.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another crucial point was whether Google, as a potential &amp;ldquo;controller&amp;rdquo; of data, bore liability for its processing. The CJEU, contradicting the Advocate-General&amp;rsquo;s opinion, concluded that Google was indeed a data controller. The Court highlighted the distinction between initial data publication and its subsequent processing by search engines, asserting Google&amp;rsquo;s control over the search process. This scenario evokes comparisons to the fictional portrayal of a manipulative search engine tycoon in the TV show &lt;em>The Good Wife&lt;/em>, despite obvious differences from Google&amp;rsquo;s leadership.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Court emphasized that search engines broaden information access and create comprehensive user profiles, impacting privacy more significantly than original website publications.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Territorial scope&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Court addressed whether the Directive applies to a California-based search engine company with a Spanish subsidiary. The national court proposed three potential grounds: the presence of an &amp;ldquo;establishment,&amp;rdquo; the &amp;ldquo;use of equipment&amp;rdquo; (crawlers, data storage, domain names), or the default application of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The CJEU found that Google Spain, by virtue of its &amp;ldquo;establishment&amp;rdquo; in the territory, was subject to the data protection Directive as implemented by Spain. While not ruling on the other possibilities, the Court acknowledged the Directive&amp;rsquo;s broad territorial scope, particularly in the internet context.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The CJEU determined that Google Spain&amp;rsquo;s advertising activities, integral to Google&amp;rsquo;s business model of linking ads to search results, constituted an &amp;ldquo;establishment,&amp;rdquo; even though the subsidiary wasn&amp;rsquo;t directly involved in search engine operations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Responsibility of search engine operators&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The CJEU asserted the responsibility of search engine operators, as separate entities from original publishers, to remove information from search results, even if the initial publication was lawful. The right to rectify, erase, or block data applied not just to inaccurate information but also to unlawful processing based on data quality, processing criteria, or the right to object on &amp;ldquo;compelling legitimate grounds.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Individuals could request data removal from search results and seek legal redress or approach data protection authorities if their requests were denied. Article 7(f) of the Directive, allowing data processing based on the &amp;ldquo;legitimate interests of the controller,&amp;rdquo; wasn&amp;rsquo;t applicable here, as the data subject&amp;rsquo;s rights took precedence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While acknowledging the need to balance rights, including freedom of expression, the Court ruled that the ease of accessing information and the comprehensive profiles created by search engines tilted the balance in favor of privacy over the search engine&amp;rsquo;s economic interest. Public interest in the information was only relevant if the data subject was a public figure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Given their impact on privacy, search engines faced a stricter application of the balancing test, potentially resulting in information remaining accessible on original websites but blocked from search results. The CJEU stated that the &amp;ldquo;journalistic&amp;rdquo; exception within the Directive wasn&amp;rsquo;t applicable to search engines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>The ‘right to be forgotten’&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The CJEU acknowledged that the Directive&amp;rsquo;s provisions on data retention limits and relevance implied a &amp;ldquo;right to be forgotten,&amp;rdquo; although not explicitly stated. While leaving the application to the national court, the CJEU strongly suggested that the plaintiff&amp;rsquo;s rights had been violated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This judgment&amp;rsquo;s primary flaw lies in its prioritization of privacy rights over other relevant rights.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Court&amp;rsquo;s perspective on privacy is understandable. Information about an individual&amp;rsquo;s finances is &amp;ldquo;personal data,&amp;rdquo; and prior publication doesn&amp;rsquo;t negate this, especially concerning search engines. Additionally, the Court&amp;rsquo;s prior ruling in the Lindqvist case correctly identified online data placement as a form of &amp;ldquo;data processing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While Google&amp;rsquo;s classification as a &amp;ldquo;data controller&amp;rdquo; might seem less clear-cut, the Court&amp;rsquo;s conclusion is ultimately justified, considering the additional processing and value added by search engines. In this sense, Google&amp;rsquo;s success is a double-edged sword.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Regarding territorial scope, it&amp;rsquo;s logical that Google, with a subsidiary, a domain name, and advertising operations in Spain, falls under the Directive&amp;rsquo;s purview. The advertising revenue generated through free searches forms the backbone of Google&amp;rsquo;s business model (excluding acquired companies like YouTube and Blogger), and profit-making is undeniably a core &amp;ldquo;activity&amp;rdquo; for such businesses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Google&amp;rsquo;s separate liability as a &amp;ldquo;data controller&amp;rdquo; justifies the Court&amp;rsquo;s ruling that it might be required to remove information violating the data protection Directive. This is particularly relevant for inaccurate or defamatory data but doesn&amp;rsquo;t directly apply here, where the information is simply embarrassing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Therefore, without other legitimate grounds for processing (typically absent for search engines), the case hinges on balancing the interests of the individual, the search engine, and other internet users. This is where the Court&amp;rsquo;s reasoning falters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In its ASNEF ruling, the Court deemed Spanish law inadequate for not balancing data subjects&amp;rsquo; rights with direct marketing companies&amp;rsquo; rights. By prohibiting the use of non-public personal data, the law undermined companies&amp;rsquo; right to conduct business. However, this judgment neglects this right, despite Google&amp;rsquo;s practices being as central to its business model as private data usage is for direct marketers. Notably, Google&amp;rsquo;s targeted advertising, though not directly relevant here, is a form of direct marketing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Furthermore, in ASNEF, the Court criticized the Spanish law for its automatic nature, failing to weigh individual cases. Conversely, in Google Spain, the Court establishes an automatic test: the search engine&amp;rsquo;s economic interest is superseded unless the individual is a public figure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The judgment barely acknowledges other internet users&amp;rsquo; interests, despite Article 7(f) mandating a balance between the data controller (search engine), the data subject, and third parties (the public). Surprisingly, the Court doesn&amp;rsquo;t explicitly mention the Charter&amp;rsquo;s right to freedom of expression (Article 11) nor connect its balancing test statements to the European Court of Human Rights&amp;rsquo; case law on balancing privacy and freedom of expression.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The dismissal of the journalistic exception contradicts the Court&amp;rsquo;s stance in Satamedia, where sharing personal tax data via text messages was considered &amp;ldquo;journalism.&amp;rdquo; While Google isn&amp;rsquo;t a journalist, it&amp;rsquo;s a crucial intermediary. If sharing tax information via text messages qualifies as journalism, then commenting on an individual&amp;rsquo;s past financial difficulties should too, regardless of the forum or motive. The passage of time, although relevant to privacy, shouldn&amp;rsquo;t hinder freedom of expression.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Consequences of the judgment&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While focused on search engines, this judgment&amp;rsquo;s implications could extend further, as will be explored in a future post on social networks. For search engines, those less successful than Google might not have an &amp;ldquo;establishment&amp;rdquo; as defined by this ruling, raising questions about the broader applicability of the Directive based on equipment use or the Charter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Any non-EU company with a subsidiary using targeted advertising in an EU member state would likely fall under the data protection Directive, similar to this judgment, without prejudice to broader interpretations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Search engines within the judgment&amp;rsquo;s scope, especially Google, now face greater legal obligations. They must address complaints about outdated or irrelevant personal data, regardless of accuracy, and risk legal action or scrutiny from supervisory authorities. Individuals could also proactively approach supervisory authorities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, supervisory authorities likely cannot act independently, as the rights in this case are complaint-driven. While some actively monitor their online presence, others might be unaware of, indifferent to, or even pleased with old information about themselves being accessible through Google.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Therefore, not everyone potentially embarrassed by such information will complain, but many might. Google&amp;rsquo;s responsibility lies in responding to individuals, not overhauling its data processing practices without specific complaints.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the judgment&amp;rsquo;s interpretation raises questions: what constitutes a &amp;ldquo;public figure,&amp;rdquo; and when does personal data become irrelevant? For instance, a job applicant could reasonably object to embarrassing photos from their past appearing in Google search results. However, they can&amp;rsquo;t demand the removal of recent content, even if they have no memory of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Such disputes might lead to arguments for a narrower interpretation of this judgment or even calls for the Court to reconsider aspects of its ruling. For now, the CJEU has established a potentially expansive &amp;ldquo;right to be forgotten,&amp;rdquo; significantly impacting search engines. While the Lindqvist judgment aimed to adapt the data protection Directive to the internet, Google Spain seems to demand the reverse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This judgment could accelerate the Directive&amp;rsquo;s amendment process, replacing it with a general data protection Regulation. Internet companies now have an incentive to actively participate in shaping the regulation to limit their liability, a stark contrast to their previous preference for delaying the process to avoid increased obligations. Time will reveal the outcome of this negotiation.&lt;/p>

Metro Ethernet is a popular choice, often providing more bandwidth for less money than traditional telecommunications services. But is it available in your area?&lt;/p>

alt="Click to enter your building address and get a map for Ethernet services."
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can easily check availability using an Ethernet service finder to view a map of &amp;ldquo;lit&amp;rdquo; buildings nearby. A lit building has active fiber optic service, meaning the fiber optic cables are installed and operational with active laser light. In contrast, dark fiber refers to installed but inactive fiber optic cabling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lit buildings offer quick and easy access to fiber optic service. The infrastructure, like digging trenches and installing fiber cables, is already in place. Connecting you to the vast bandwidth available through fiber is a relatively simple process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If your business is located in or can relocate to a lit building, you&amp;rsquo;re almost guaranteed access to Metro Ethernet at a competitive price. Sharing a high-bandwidth connection with other tenants presents an opportunity for even lower costs and high-volume usage. But what if your building isn&amp;rsquo;t currently serviced by fiber optics? Can you still get Metro Ethernet?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s a good chance you can. If a neighboring building has fiber, extending that service to your location is usually straightforward. Most of the heavy lifting, like laying fiber from the carrier&amp;rsquo;s Point of Presence (POP) to the building&amp;rsquo;s telecom room, is already done. Extending the fiber next door is a relatively minor task. In fact, you might even get this service for little to no cost if you commit to a reasonable bandwidth level.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What happens if there&amp;rsquo;s no fiber optic infrastructure in your vicinity? That scenario is trickier, depending on your location and bandwidth requirements. You might be surprised to learn that Ethernet operates on both twisted pair copper telephone cables and fiber. Not every business needs Gbps data speeds. Popular Metro Ethernet services offering 3 Mbps and 10 Mbps are easily delivered through existing copper cable infrastructure. This means you can be miles away from the nearest POP and still have access to Ethernet over Copper. While speeds up to 45 Mbps are possible, they necessitate a closer carrier POP for those higher bandwidths.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Is Metro Ethernet available in remote areas? It&amp;rsquo;s unlikely, as the &amp;ldquo;Metro&amp;rdquo; designation suggests. However, you might have options like EoDS1 (Ethernet over DS1), which utilizes T1 lines to provide Ethernet service. Ordering a single or multiple bonded T1 lines, depending on your bandwidth needs, is also a possibility regardless of your location.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To determine if Metro Ethernet is an option for your business, enter your business address (residential addresses are not applicable) into the &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.ethernettoday.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Shop For Ethernet WAN Search box&lt;/a>. The resulting map reveals the proximity of lit buildings to your location. Telarus consultants can then provide you with availability and pricing for Ethernet and other telecom services. You might find your location qualifies for a wider array of services and lower prices than you anticipated.&lt;/p>

Small businesses can buy systems from local stores, while medium-sized businesses often work with contractors for key telephone systems or small PBXs. Larger companies may have internal teams that handle complex telephone systems. Nowadays, hosted VoIP is a cost-effective option for companies of all sizes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.enterprisevoip.com/usa/BusinessPhoneSystems/business_phone_systems.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

loading="lazy"
alt="Check out the advantages of hosted VoIP solutions for your company&amp;hellip;"
>&lt;/a>How can one solution meet the needs of different-sized businesses affordably? It&amp;rsquo;s not a one-size-fits-all solution but a scalable technology adaptable to different demands—hosted VoIP, also known as hosted PBX or cloud telephone systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The cloud metaphor illustrates its nature. It involves using a large data center designed for business telephony for multiple clients. Its cloud service characteristics include significant scalable capacity and virtualization, ensuring client isolation. Billing follows a pay-as-you-go cloud model. The service provider invests in infrastructure, operation, and maintenance, while clients pay monthly per user.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hosted VoIP usually offers telephone services comparable to advanced PBX systems. It includes call switching, in-house calls, local calls, and domestic long distance for a single price. International calls are billed separately, like traditional calling plans.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One benefit of hosted solutions is connecting multiple business locations. This setup helps avoid toll charges for interoffice calls. However, it involves network convergence and running SIP trunks between PBX systems. By bypassing traditional telephone companies, you become your own provider within your company locations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hosted VoIP providers manage a virtual PBX cloud. Each location connects to this cloud through your network. The cloud acts as a central hub, regardless of the handset&amp;rsquo;s physical location. These network devices can connect for conference calls.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hosted VoIP now allows sharing external lines across locations. Internal calls stay within the network (&amp;ldquo;on-net&amp;rdquo;), while external calls require PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network). Traditionally, each location had a PBX with dedicated outside lines, resulting in potential line availability issues. With a hosted solution, PSTN trunks reside in the cloud, accessible from any location, optimizing usage. Not all providers offer this, so inquire about this cost-saving feature if needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve established that hosted VoIP offers advantages like scalability, pay-as-you-go pricing, no upfront investment, and no maintenance. It also connects multiple locations with advanced PBX features. Many providers integrate mobile phones for easy access. Some even include new desk phones in their service plans.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Could hosted VoIP be your next phone system? Explore pricing and features for different &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.enterprisevoip.com/usa/BusinessPhoneSystems/business_phone_systems.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

For those unfamiliar, the System Password in Dynamics GP (found under Administration Page &amp;gt; Setup &amp;gt; System Password) safeguards all system menus (Setup, Cards, Reports, etc.) with a password. This means users need to enter the password to access these windows, even if they technically have permission.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgEnuOn7QCBcZNx1QyPuS5uDlpmzF21xcunBZtNFcK3fiUkl0Sjg-vfa7clHihScn0W-uq1qklZHJVFsmal5aJ4_ql_Os6A4tbkvqpix9Si4_1A0tBp1m8ogEsFYlEbPFzOZHG4BRD32Bhl/s1600/SystemPassword.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgEnuOn7QCBcZNx1QyPuS5uDlpmzF21xcunBZtNFcK3fiUkl0Sjg-vfa7clHihScn0W-uq1qklZHJVFsmal5aJ4_ql_Os6A4tbkvqpix9Si4_1A0tBp1m8ogEsFYlEbPFzOZHG4BRD32Bhl/s400/SystemPassword.jpg"
loading="lazy"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This feature was particularly beneficial in older Dynamics GP versions where security was optimistic, granting all users initial access to all windows. Implementing the System Password provided a quick security layer for these settings. However, its usefulness has diminished over time due to several factors:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>While the System menu houses critical windows, many equally important and potentially vulnerable windows reside within module-level setups, routines, and utilities. A comprehensive security setup is crucial for complete system protection.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The System Password offers an all-or-nothing approach. If a user only requires access to specific windows, like exchange tables or Smartlist options, the password acts as a barrier.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The password itself is relatively easy to recover. Someone with sufficient knowledge could potentially uncover it, even without access to the setup window.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Relying solely on the System Password can create a false sense of security for administrators. While it may seem like the system&amp;rsquo;s most vital aspects are locked down, this might not be the case. Even with the introduction of pessimistic, role and task-based security in Dynamics GP (where users initially only have login access), many continue to use the System Password as a simple extra check. This practice isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily problematic if robust security measures are in place, including control over windows accessed through security menus. However, if your security strategy doesn&amp;rsquo;t account for the points mentioned above, relying on the System Password as your primary defense is strongly discouraged.&lt;/p>

These distinct classes got me thinking about the elements of exceptional training and what makes it truly valuable. I&amp;rsquo;d love to share my thoughts and hear yours!&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Relevant Content:&lt;/strong> It&amp;rsquo;s crucial for training content to align with student needs. While this can be challenging with pre-determined classes, instructors can bridge the gap by connecting content to real-world scenarios. Students, too, play a role by actively sharing their experiences and insights.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Collaborative Learning:&lt;/strong> Learning becomes much more dynamic when students actively participate and share their experiences. While the instructor guides the discussion, genuine understanding blossoms when students connect and learn from each other.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Practical Application:&lt;/strong> Knowing the &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rdquo; is important, but the true value lies in understanding &amp;ldquo;how&amp;rdquo; to apply knowledge in practical situations. Instructors can facilitate this by sharing their own experiences and encouraging students to do the same, extending learning beyond the classroom. I personally find it incredibly rewarding when students share their post-training successes.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Full Engagement:&lt;/strong> Everyone involved - both the instructor and students - needs to be fully present and engaged for a training to be truly effective. Instructors should create an environment that welcomes diverse perspectives, while students should actively participate and contribute their unique viewpoints. A knowledgeable and well-prepared instructor who can go beyond the textbook is essential.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m eager to hear your perspectives on what constitutes excellent training, students, and instructors! Share your thoughts!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Managed Hosting PBX Gets You Out Of The Telephone Business</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/managed-hosting-pbx-gets-you-out-of-the-telephone-business/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2024 08:00:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/managed-hosting-pbx-gets-you-out-of-the-telephone-business/</guid><description>&lt;p>A lot of businesses find themselves managing their own phone systems simply because they need phones to operate, even though it&amp;rsquo;s not their core business. This has become the norm, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be this way anymore.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Companies previously invested in extensive phone systems because the productivity gains from each employee having a direct line outweighed the costs. In the past, a single phone line sufficed, but with the information age, constant communication became essential, driving the need for dedicated telecom departments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These departments manage the PBX system, essentially a smaller version of a phone company&amp;rsquo;s central office. It connects internal calls and manages external lines. This setup requires constant upkeep, including replacing faulty phones, rewiring, and managing employee changes, all adding to the cost of doing business.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The financial burden includes managing these daily changes and the capital expense of the equipment. PBX systems are costly, and upgrades can necessitate loans for significant replacements. However, there&amp;rsquo;s a more efficient alternative: hosted PBX.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hosted PBX shifts the responsibility of managing the system to a third-party provider. This eliminates the need for on-site equipment and frees up your resources. With this setup, employees can enjoy the same, if not better, phone functionality, often with &amp;ldquo;smart&amp;rdquo; phones integrated with the computer network.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is possible due to the widespread use of company computer networks. Phones now use the existing broadband network to transmit data packets, connecting to a service provider who manages everything remotely. This makes them more efficient and cost-effective. It&amp;rsquo;s essentially a return to &amp;ldquo;telephone as a service,&amp;rdquo; or in today&amp;rsquo;s terms, &amp;ldquo;voice as a service.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If your company is stuck managing its phone system, it&amp;rsquo;s worth exploring managed PBX hosting solutions. You might find a better and more cost-effective option for your business needs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): Restoration of the Main PCB and Installation of a Biasing Trimmer for TR3</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-restoration-of-the-main-pcb-and-installation-of-a-biasing-trimmer-for-tr3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2024 07:52:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-restoration-of-the-main-pcb-and-installation-of-a-biasing-trimmer-for-tr3/</guid><description>&lt;p>After getting the Beogram 4002 (5513) operational again, I focused on fully restoring the main PCB. This involved installing a trimmer to correctly calibrate TR3, the transistor responsible for amplifying the signal from the record detection sensor. The board&amp;rsquo;s condition upon arrival is shown below:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjXOqjOgkJ-FtoySUGToDWrR71S0sUKp1ijcBHli2w1Tgt0C2_l0PEj100D1Ep0XWPoN3HuRAE2n8k2DiLm_U4duf1Da6BcDbwT1HGwAxjYAW_9EN1CDYotMpj41kUj1mR-gXXb93F3TK4/s1600/Beogram&amp;#43;4002&amp;#43;PCB&amp;#43;partially&amp;#43;restored.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The RPM relay and trimmers had already been replaced by the owner. I finished the restoration by replacing all electrolytic capacitors&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgufhkbIfOxWsjL5Ap9mbPJfENXaJ6F5eyPwjp0oXQMQJVrQIf0-FfSGWVVQDNvKnV9Q-83ckLPlqmtHUPZfxPTe9WmcikJAH_tpPwG769LMwdzLyv38hraCQmGG3Y5O2SeAs4AGY4o2fA/s1600/Beogram&amp;#43;4002&amp;#43;recapped.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>and adding a trimmer to enable bias adjustment at the base of TR3. To make adjustments with the board powered on, the trimmer was temporarily placed on the back, as pictured here:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>After adjusting the collector DC voltage to 4.0V, I fixed the trimmer to the component side:&lt;/p>

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The original design used a fixed resistor, often causing insufficient amplification due to inconsistencies in the TR3 transistor&amp;rsquo;s current gain. Adequate amplification is crucial to avoid needle damage if the turntable is accidentally started without a record in place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, I improved the installation of the replacement reservoir capacitor assembly, which had been installed previously:&lt;/p>

Here&amp;rsquo;s what happened:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>I created two SQL views based on GP and custom tables.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I granted the SmartList Builder access to these views (Tools &amp;raquo; SmartList Builder &amp;raquo; Security &amp;raquo; SQL Table Security).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I created my SmartList (Tools &amp;raquo; SmartList Builder &amp;raquo; SmartList Builder).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>After testing, the SmartList worked correctly.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I deployed the views to the client&amp;rsquo;s environment.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I exported the SmartList Builder settings to an XML file.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I imported the XML file into the client&amp;rsquo;s system.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I granted access to the views for SmartList Builder at the client site.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When trying to view the SmartList, an error appeared: &amp;ldquo;You do not have security privileges to view all of the tables used in this SmartList.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Following KB Article #967731, I configured a Security Task and Security Role to include &amp;ldquo;Smarlist Builder\Smartlist Builder Permissions\Smartlist Builder\View Smartlists with SQL Tables.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The error persisted.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I granted DYNGRP SELECT permissions on both views.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The error remained.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I ran Grant.SQL.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The error still occurred.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Frustratingly, this error affected both regular users and the &amp;lsquo;sa&amp;rsquo; account. The solution? Permissions must be set &lt;strong>before&lt;/strong> importing the XML file. While I haven&amp;rsquo;t confirmed the minimum steps, ensure steps 8, 12, and 14 are completed before importing. To be safe, I recommend steps 8, 10, 12, and 14.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After setting permissions and then importing the XML, everything worked perfectly. It seems permissions set after import aren&amp;rsquo;t fully recognized.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy holidays!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Users of Forecaster and Dynamics GP</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/users-of-forecaster-and-dynamics-gp/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2024 04:32:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/users-of-forecaster-and-dynamics-gp/</guid><description>&lt;p>Have you ever encountered a problem where you vaguely recall a solution but can&amp;rsquo;t seem to locate the specific article or link? This happened to me recently with a client attempting to use their Dynamics GP user ID for Forecaster 7. As expected, it was unsuccessful due to GP&amp;rsquo;s encryption method when generating user IDs in SQL.

Websites, software, and files continue to grow larger, but unfortunately, technology budgets haven&amp;rsquo;t kept pace. Imagine doubling your internet speed without increasing your current expenses – an appealing proposition, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you agree?&lt;/p>

>&lt;/a>It might sound illogical to suggest that doubling your internet speed wouldn&amp;rsquo;t cost more, especially since internet providers aren&amp;rsquo;t known for giving things away for free. The secret lies in adopting newer, more cost-effective technology instead of simply replacing your existing service with an identical one from another provider.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One way to double your internet speed with your current or a new provider, while retaining your T1 line service, is to order a second T1 line and &amp;ldquo;bond&amp;rdquo; it with your existing line. Bonding combines two lines to function as a single, faster line. A single T1 line provides 1.5 Mbps, so bonding two lines results in a speed of 3 Mbps. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, there are a couple of limitations. First, both T1 lines must be from the same provider, either your current one or a new one for both lines. Second, your monthly cost will double since you&amp;rsquo;re now paying for two lines. While you might find a different vendor offering lower prices for the same service, this alone likely won&amp;rsquo;t get you 3 Mbps for the price of 1.5 Mbps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead of simply doubling down on T1 lines, consider switching to Ethernet over Copper. Both are dependable business-grade internet services with dedicated bandwidth. They can also be managed services, where the provider handles all the necessary equipment at your location to connect to their lines and your network. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another similarity between bonded T1 lines and Ethernet over Copper is that they both utilize the existing copper telephone wires already installed in your building. Although the signal types differ between T1 and Ethernet lines, they function the same way from a user&amp;rsquo;s perspective. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>The key difference lies in the cost. Ethernet over Copper, being a newer technology, utilizes the bandwidth capacity of copper lines more effectively. As a result, its pricing is very competitive, currently about half the cost of two bonded T1 lines. This means you could obtain a 3 Mbps Ethernet over Copper service for the same price as a 1.5 Mbps T1 service. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few other distinctions exist as well. T1 lines can only be upgraded in increments of 1.5 Mbps per bonded line. Ethernet, on the other hand, offers more flexibility, with bandwidth options ranging from 1 Mbps up to 10 Gbps, though higher speeds necessitate fiber optic cables. However, unlike T1, Ethernet over Copper has limited availability, primarily found in larger cities and suburbs rather than rural areas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Interested in doubling your internet speed without increasing your costs? Check pricing and availability for 3 x 3 Mbps Ethernet over Copper or other Ethernet bandwidth services to discover potential savings in your area.&lt;/p>

Many companies are discovering that environmentally friendly practices can save them money. These eco-conscious choices benefit both the planet and their bottom line.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the first areas to examine is electricity consumption. Power usage can be deceptive because it often occurs in small, unnoticeable increments. Every desktop computer, even when idle, contributes to the overall energy use, measured in watt-hours and kilowatt-hours. While electricity costs are easily offset by profits generated from productive work, the issue arises during idle time. Even when computers are unused, they still consume power, leading to unnecessary expenses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many companies have adopted a policy of shutting down computers and monitors overnight and during extended periods of inactivity. This practice has been proven to generate significant savings without significantly impacting equipment lifespan. In reality, most computers become obsolete before they wear out from use. When disposing of old electronics, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to recycle responsibly, as circuit boards and CRTs contain hazardous materials. Proper recycling prevents these toxins from polluting the environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Turning off equipment when not in use, ideally with a mechanical switch that cuts off standby power, offers two advantages. First, it directly reduces the device&amp;rsquo;s power consumption. Second, it minimizes heat generation. No electronic device is perfectly efficient; some energy is always lost as heat. While essential for operation, this heat can become excessive, especially in server rooms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Server rooms, with their concentrated computing power, often require substantial cooling. As equipment density increases, so does the need for air conditioning, creating a cycle of escalating energy consumption. To address this, designers are focusing on more efficient power supplies and even exploring DC power distribution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, maintaining an on-site server room might not always be the most practical solution. Colocation facilities offer a compelling alternative by distributing power and environmental control costs among multiple users. Additionally, colocation often provides access to more competitive bandwidth pricing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For businesses looking to further minimize their reliance on grid power, generating their own electricity is an option. Office buildings and factories often have large, unused roof areas suitable for solar panel installation. By feeding into the grid, these solar arrays can significantly reduce daytime power consumption, especially during peak pricing hours. Google, among other companies, has already embraced solar power to supplement its energy needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re considering upgrading to more energy-efficient computing equipment, consider consulting a network of value-added resellers. These experts can help you find the best deals on servers and network devices that can contribute to both environmental and financial savings.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>By Chris Jones&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A new report, &lt;em>Back from the battlefield: domestic drones in the UK&lt;/em>, investigates the use of drones by public and private entities in the UK. It focuses on law enforcement and border control agencies, examining the laws, regulations, and public and private funding surrounding drone technology development. The report analyzes the current situation and potential future applications, advocating for public discussion and decision-making before widespread drone use, particularly for surveillance, becomes commonplace.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to limited safety measures and regulatory frameworks, drone use in the UK is currently restricted, especially among public entities, despite efforts to broaden their adoption. Currently, private companies undertaking surveying, mapping, photography, filming, and safety inspections operate the majority of licensed drones in UK airspace. However, as technology advances and becomes more readily available, this is expected to shift. Various initiatives are underway to capitalize on the anticipated substantial market for civilian drones.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Public Funds&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Millions of pounds in public and private funding directed toward drone technology and regulation research and development are propelling this push. In the past decade, approximately £80 million in public funds have been allocated to domestic drone research and development, though this figure likely underrepresents the true amount given the potential civilian applications of military drone research.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ASTRAEA, the UK&amp;rsquo;s flagship research program, received £32 million in public funding, matched by the private sector. This program aimed to develop technology enabling routine drone flights in domestic airspace with minimal consideration for privacy, data protection, or other civil liberties and human rights implications. It appears to have been designed and implemented by major arms manufacturers, such as BAE Systems, Cassidian, Cobham, Rolls-Royce, and Thales, alongside government officials, without democratic input or oversight.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Civilian drone research and testing in the UK are poised for further expansion with the September 2013 establishment of the National Aeronautical Centre. This privately owned facility enables the development, testing, evaluation, training, and demonstration of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) capable of flying beyond visual range. This center complements existing drone testing facilities in west Wales, primarily used for defense purposes but now accessible to civilian and military contractors and operators. It has the capacity to accommodate all anticipated UAS sizes for production and development over the next 20 years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The exact amount invested by private firms in drone research and development over the past decade remains unclear. However, in publicly available data on joint public-private projects, public funding consistently outweighs private contributions. This aligns with established models of public investment in technologies not yet considered market-ready. However, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to note that private companies are ultimately positioned to reap the financial rewards of a projected multi-billion pound domestic drone market.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this context, the role of government bodies in &amp;ldquo;market creation&amp;rdquo; is evident, as demonstrated by ongoing attempts by the European Commission to integrate drones into domestic airspace. Recent information reveals a UK &amp;ldquo;Cross Government Working Group on Remotely Piloted Aerial Systems&amp;rdquo; with multiple objectives, including identifying and addressing obstacles to a successful UK industry base to support the government&amp;rsquo;s growth agenda.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Civil Liberties Concerns&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Notably absent from the Cross Government Working Group&amp;rsquo;s priorities is any mention of privacy or civil liberties. The government&amp;rsquo;s stance appears clear, with Policing Minister Damian Green stating in May 2013 that the use of unmanned aerial vehicles must comply with existing Civil Aviation Authority regulations. Covert use by public authorities, including law enforcement, would require authorization under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA) 2000. Additionally, any overt use of surveillance camera systems in public spaces within England and Wales would be subject to a new code of practice under the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, both RIPA and the new (voluntary) Surveillance Camera Code of Practice have significant flaws and do not apply to private entities or individuals. RIPA, in particular, has been widely criticized by legal professionals, advocacy groups, and charities. The legal support charity JUSTICE argues that RIPA fails to provide adequate safeguards against unwarranted and excessive surveillance, rendering it insufficient to address developments such as aerial surveillance drones, Automatic Number Plate Recognition, deep packet interception, and the internet itself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Given these inadequacies, compounded by ongoing revelations about mass telecommunications surveillance by security agencies and the controversial use of undercover police officers in protest movements, a comprehensive review of the UK&amp;rsquo;s legal and regulatory framework surrounding surveillance is arguably necessary.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The crucial issues of safety, airworthiness, and pilot training are overseen by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) in the UK. Current regulations appear to address these concerns reasonably well, particularly the tendency of drones to crash. However, there are growing apprehensions about drones weighing less than 7kg, which fall outside the scope of CAA regulations, especially given the increasing construction, purchase, and use of drones by individuals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While enforcing a regulatory and legal framework for &amp;ldquo;DIY&amp;rdquo; drones, especially smaller models, may prove challenging, it is becoming increasingly necessary as private drone use expands. These devices are prone to crashing, resulting in reported fatalities and injuries from falling drones. The risk is significant: earlier this year, the US Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) disclosed a near-collision between a small drone and an airliner over Florida, which could have had catastrophic consequences. The increasing use of drones by private companies also raises questions about the government&amp;rsquo;s reliance on a voluntary Surveillance Camera Code of Practice and the provisions of the Data Protection Act, enacted in 1998 when surveillance by aerial drone was a distant prospect.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Law Enforcement and Drones&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Responses to Freedom of Information requests sent to all UK police forces reveal that eleven forces have reportedly used drones, but only two—Staffordshire and the Police Service of Northern Ireland—currently employ the technology. These forces utilize drones for various purposes, including monitoring demonstrations, surveilling poachers, deterring antisocial behavior, and tracking criminals. Other forces have encountered obstacles: Merseyside police, after boasting about apprehending a car thief using a drone, were reprimanded by the Civil Aviation Authority and prohibited from operating their drone due to a lack of licensing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Further removed from public scrutiny, the Serious Organised Crime Agency (now the National Crime Agency) appears to have acquired drone technology in late 2012, signing a £9 million contract with Selex ES for five years of &amp;ldquo;managed air support services.&amp;rdquo; While Selex ES does not manufacture planes or helicopters, it produces and sells advanced unmanned aerial systems (UAS) to customers globally. This contract coincided with British police forces increasingly invoking &amp;ldquo;national security&amp;rdquo; exemptions when responding to Freedom of Information requests related to drones, allowing them to neither confirm nor deny information pertaining to the Serious Organised Crime Agency.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over time, the police&amp;rsquo;s approach to unmanned technology has become more centralized. An Unmanned Aerial Systems Steering Group, established in October 2012 and run by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) and the National Police Air Service, keeps chief constables updated on developments. A standardized technical requirement for police drones has been developed by the Home Office, and police representatives are presumably involved in the aforementioned Cross Government Working Group.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While the National Police Air Service remains reticent about its drone-related information, referring inquiries back to ACPO, it seems that the widespread acquisition and deployment of drones by police forces is not imminent. This suggests that the time for a meaningful debate on the issue is now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Drones for Border Control?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Revelations in 2010 that Kent Police and the UK Border Agency collaborated with BAE Systems to develop drones for border monitoring sparked concerns among civil liberties organizations. Other proposed applications included monitoring illegal waste disposal and ATM thefts. However, this project, known as the South Coast Partnership, is defunct. Kent Police, who later downplayed the project as &amp;ldquo;never a structured arrangement,&amp;rdquo; were seemingly abandoned by BAE Systems, receiving notification of the project&amp;rsquo;s termination via telephone. The force claims to possess no documentation related to the project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nevertheless, Kent Police are participating in a cross-border, European Union-funded project called &amp;ldquo;3i&amp;rdquo; with French and Dutch authorities and institutions. This project, with a similar objective of utilizing drones for border control, critical infrastructure monitoring, and environmental monitoring, received half its total funding (€1,854,571) from the European Commission&amp;rsquo;s Directorate-General for Regional Policy, with Kent Police receiving €53,421.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The project aims to deliver a prototype unmanned aerial vehicle and contribute to the knowledge base on UAVs and their application for maritime security, encompassing incident response, preventive patrols of points of interest, and critical infrastructure monitoring. One use case involves monitoring unexpected movements of small vessels across borders for activities like smuggling, which may be of interest to ACPO&amp;rsquo;s Unmanned Aerial Systems Steering Group, which previously noted the potential usefulness of drones deployed at borders for &amp;ldquo;securing the borders from refugees and drug importation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>A Democratic Debate&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In conclusion, the report argues that the widespread deployment of high-powered state surveillance drones, a fear frequently voiced in recent media, has not materialized. Therefore, it is crucial to initiate a public dialogue about domestic drones promptly and to determine acceptable limitations on their use in an open and democratic manner, rather than through secretive working groups and industry-dominated research consortiums.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The CJEU provides clarification on the applicable law and jurisdiction for data protection.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-provides-clarification-on-the-applicable-law-and-jurisdiction-for-data-protection/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jun 2024 04:41:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-provides-clarification-on-the-applicable-law-and-jurisdiction-for-data-protection/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhP_G1lV_52WIET3-AHXQTy3I5Msebf0y-iDDg4Jg_e0bgWn2hpJNl5RFWpCoG1QqNV0E5xFy9_ce-QzMjtaur5hwLKXhF4L6dlMbVGCFLbAF11hrBuWESLYIIMxYfOByr1D2KNrAJaJVo/s1600/batman.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Lorna Woods, Professor of Internet Law, University of Essex*&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) recently issued a decision in the Weltimmo case regarding the jurisdictional reach of data protection authorities. The court ruled that the authority of one Member State can exercise jurisdiction over entities primarily operating outside of that state’s borders. This ruling could impact two important issues being considered for the proposed data protection regulation: the regulation&amp;rsquo;s territorial scope and the authority of national data protection bodies. In particular, it raises questions about the viability of a &amp;ldquo;one-stop shop&amp;rdquo; approach to regulation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Facts **&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Weltimmo, a company incorporated in Slovakia, operates a website that advertises properties in Hungary. For this service, it collects and manages the personal data of property advertisers. Numerous advertisers requested, via email, the removal of their advertisements and personal data, but Weltimmo failed to delete the data and continued to bill them. When payment wasn&amp;rsquo;t received, Weltimmo transferred the advertisers’ personal information to debt collection firms.  Consequently, the advertisers filed complaints with the Hungarian data protection authority. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Weltimmo contended that the Hungarian authority lacked jurisdiction and should have instead referred the matter to the Slovakian data protection authority. However, the Hungarian authority cited Article 4 of the Data Protection Directive, which states that each Member State must apply its national data protection laws to data processing activities carried out &amp;ldquo;in the context of the activities of an establishment of the controller on the territory of the Member State.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Therefore, the issue became determining where Weltimmo was established. Regardless of the applicable law, the Hungarian authority believed it held jurisdiction under Article 28 of the Directive, which addresses the role and authority of national data protection bodies. These points of interpretation were then referred to the CJEU.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Judgment&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The CJEU&amp;rsquo;s judgment generally aligns with the Advocate General&amp;rsquo;s opinion. The court concluded that the national law applicable to the controller (Weltimmo) must be assessed considering Article 4, while Article 28 addresses the roles and powers of national authorities. Thus, the central issue was whether the data processing occurred &amp;ldquo;in the context of the activities of an establishment.&amp;rdquo; To ensure the protection of fundamental rights, the court decided this concept should be broadly interpreted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The court drew upon the Advocate General’s perspective, highlighting that &amp;ldquo;establishment&amp;rdquo; should be understood as a broad and flexible concept that considers more than just the controller&amp;rsquo;s place of registration. The court emphasized that &amp;ldquo;establishment&amp;rdquo; encompasses any genuine and effective business activity, even a minimal one, conducted through a stable arrangement. Notably, the presence of even a single representative can be sufficient depending on the circumstances.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Applying this reasoning, the court determined that Weltimmo was indeed established in Hungary. They had a representative, a bank account, and contact details in the country. Additionally, the court recognized that Weltimmo was engaged in a real and effective business activity within Hungary.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After establishing the presence of an establishment, the next question was whether the data processing was connected to the activities conducted through that establishment. The court, again referencing its Google Spain decision, clarified that the processing doesn’t need to be “by” the establishment, but rather “in the context of” the activities carried out through it. The court found this condition satisfied in this case.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Significantly, the court decided that the nationality of the individuals whose data was processed was not relevant in this context. The analysis focused on the data controller, not the data subjects. This reasoning implies that Hungarian law could apply, but the CJEU left the final determination of facts to the national court.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Furthermore, the court stated that if the law of another Member State were to apply, Article 28 of the Directive would be relevant. This provision grants each national data protection authority the responsibility and authority to ensure compliance with data protection regulations within their territory. While the wording differs from Article 4, the court didn&amp;rsquo;t elaborate on what &amp;ldquo;on the territory of its own Member State&amp;rdquo; precisely means within a digital framework. Instead, the CJEU held that a national authority could investigate a complaint, regardless of the applicable law.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As noted by the Advocate General, the data protection authority’s enforcement powers must be exercised while respecting the territorial sovereignty of other Member States and the rule of law. Consequently, a national authority cannot impose penalties outside its own territory. In such situations, the authority should seek cooperation from the relevant national authority, as outlined in Article 28, to ensure enforcement.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comment&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This ruling clarifies that a one-stop-regulation approach is not currently in effect. Consequently, businesses with operations in several Member States might face varying interpretations of data protection rules. Determining which and how many authorities have jurisdiction hinges on the definition of “establishment.” While the data subjects&amp;rsquo; nationality isn’t a factor, the court chose not to take a strictly legalistic approach.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While considering elements such as employees or physical presence, business practices also come into play. Significantly, the court acknowledged the distinctive nature of internet-based enterprises. This implies that if a business consistently operates within a territory, a physical presence might not be required to establish &amp;ldquo;establishment.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The court&amp;rsquo;s reaffirmation of its position in the Google Spain case, regarding the connection between data processing and the business, underscores this approach. The court adopts a broad view of how such a connection might arise, suggesting that arguments based on legal technicalities are unlikely to succeed. This could have significant implications for companies like Facebook, which have relied on the argument that being regulated in Ireland shields them from claims by authorities from other EU countries. However, the Weltimmo ruling weakens this argument. This expansive interpretation of applicable law might also reduce the frequency of situations covered by Article 28(6).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>More generally, the reasoning in the Weltimmo case suggests the court is maintaining its stance in the Google Spain case, emphasizing the fundamental importance of privacy and data protection. It highlights the need to interpret legal concepts broadly to ensure adequate protection for these rights. Of course, this trend was later confirmed in the Schrems judgment. It remains to be seen how the Weltimmo ruling will influence the planned data protection regulation.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When choosing a business location, consider &amp;ldquo;lit buildings&amp;rdquo; for their exceptional connectivity. These buildings are already equipped with fiber optic internet infrastructure, offering a solution to bandwidth concerns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.gigapackets.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

loading="lazy"
>&lt;/a>&lt;strong>What Does &amp;ldquo;Lit Building&amp;rdquo; Mean?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Lit building&amp;rdquo; signifies a building pre-wired for fiber optic internet and potentially point-to-point bandwidth services. The term &amp;ldquo;lit&amp;rdquo; references the laser beams used to transmit digital signals at high speeds through fiber optic cables.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Advantages of Fiber Lit Buildings&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In today&amp;rsquo;s business landscape, seamless electronic communication is essential, from small enterprises to large corporations. If your operations depend on computers, connectivity is crucial. Even the smallest businesses require internet access for credit card processing, online orders, email communication, and website management. Operating offline can hinder business growth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, securing reliable internet access can be challenging when moving into a new facility. Standalone buildings or being the first tenant often means bearing the cost and effort of installing internet service, including cabling, termination equipment setup, and provider coordination.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lit buildings eliminate these challenges because the costly and time-consuming infrastructure is already in place. Simply contract with the building&amp;rsquo;s fiber optic provider, connect your router to their termination point, and your business is online.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Services Offered in Lit Buildings&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fiber optic connections surpass traditional landlines and cable internet by offering practically limitless bandwidth. While technical limitations exist, advancements in modulation and multiplexing techniques continually increase the bandwidth capacity of a single fiber strand, with speeds of 10 Gbps readily available and 100 Gbps becoming increasingly common. For larger businesses requiring even higher bandwidth, fiber optic cables can combine hundreds of individual strands.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The services available in lit buildings are comprehensive. Ethernet over Fiber, directly compatible with most Local Area Networks (LANs), is a popular choice offering scalable bandwidth from 10 Mbps to 10 Gbps and beyond. Many providers grant users portal access for on-demand bandwidth adjustments. Traditional Synchronous Optical Networking (SONET) services like OC3 to OC48 might also be available and can be demultiplexed to provide traditional T1 line or Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) PRI phone service. Additionally, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) trunking for Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and dedicated cloud connections are typically standard offerings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Why Not Opt for Fiber?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fiber optic internet provides a transparent and future-proof bandwidth solution that effortlessly scales with business growth. The primary drawback is the cost, which can be prohibitive for small businesses and limited budgets. In such cases, business cable broadband offers a more budget-friendly option. If cable infrastructure is available at your location, you can access shared bandwidth up to 1000 Mbps at a competitive price, often without installation charges.

&lt;p>Storing your files remotely offers peace of mind. Hard drives can crash, files can be accidentally deleted, and viruses are an ever-present threat. If you&amp;rsquo;re concerned about the security of your files on someone else&amp;rsquo;s server, rest assured that Mozy prioritizes security. They use 128-bit SSL encryption during file uploads and 448-bit Blowfish encryption for storage, effectively keeping hackers at bay.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another advantage of Mozy is its automation. Set your preferred backup schedule, and the system handles the rest. No more manual backups or worrying about lost or damaged backup disks – Mozy remembers so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing to note is that the free Mozy file backup service (&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1726600-10430547" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1726600-10430547&lt;/a>) for home PCs offers 2 GB of storage. This might be sufficient for many, but if you need more space, unlimited backup is available for a small monthly fee.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Businesses also have a dedicated solution. Mozy Pro (&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1726600-10430553" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Herbert Rosenfeldt&lt;/strong>, Research Assistant and PhD candidate, University of Passau&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Introduction&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Celebrating the new European Border and Coast Guard Agency, also known as Frontex, at the Bulgarian external border with Turkey might seem like an odd festivity. However, last Thursday, high-ranking EU and Member State officials gathered at Bulgaria&amp;rsquo;s Kapitan Andreevo Border Checkpoint for this inauguration. This event marked the implementation of the European Border and Coast Guard Regulation, a significant step towards strengthening external border control in the wake of recent migration challenges.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This initiative, driven by a sense of urgency and high expectations, aims to address the perceived inability or unwillingness of national border guards to effectively protect the Schengen area from irregular migration. The rationale is straightforward: tighter external borders will deter migration, leading to fewer internal issues within the Schengen area, such as asylum allocation, processing claims, and ensuring security and freedom of movement. However, this focus on external borders has drawn criticism from various quarters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The significance of the new EBCG remains to be seen. Is it truly a turning point in European border management, as some suggest, or is it a cause for concern? What impact will it have in the long run? This analysis will delve into these questions, examining the evolving concept of EU external border management, the institutional changes, and the controversial aspects of emergency interventions and the complaints mechanism related to fundamental rights accountability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Towards Securitisation&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The new regulation reflects a clear concern about maintaining control over migration, prioritizing regaining and maintaining control over migration management and efficient border management. This approach links migration challenges and potential threats with serious cross-border crime, implying that irregular migration poses a risk to internal security. Protecting international rights and human rights, while acknowledged, are seemingly treated as secondary to securing EU borders.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This security-centric perspective is further evident in the establishment of migration management support teams for hotspot areas. While these teams aim to expedite the processing of asylum claims and returns, the underlying goal is to prevent migrants from entering the Schengen area, thereby enhancing security. Similarly, the increased support for return operations aligns with the political imperative to enforce the return of third-country nationals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Legal instruments rearranged&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>EU law concerning external border control is complex and fragmented, with frequent amendments and overlaps between various legal acts. The new regulation attempts to address this by consolidating the Frontex Regulation and the Regulation on Rapid Border Intervention Teams. Despite being based on the same EU competence (Article 77 (2) (d) TFEU), regulations concerning EUROSUR and surveillance of external sea borders remain separate, missing an opportunity for comprehensive legislation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>New concept of external border controls&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Previously, states with external Schengen borders had sole responsibility for border control, with Frontex playing a supporting role. The new EBCG introduces shared responsibility between the agency and national border and coast guards. However, this arrangement places the agency in a hierarchical position, with the authority to establish a technical and operational strategy that all national strategies must follow. This effectively gives the agency greater influence and control over border management, potentially limiting Member States&amp;rsquo; autonomy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While the regulation formally acknowledges shared responsibility, it grants the agency greater supervisory and coercive powers, shifting control away from individual Member States. Despite this, the regulation deserves recognition for establishing a legal definition of European integrated border management for the first time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Institutional changes&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Despite the rhetoric surrounding the &amp;ldquo;all-new&amp;rdquo; Frontex, the agency remains fundamentally unchanged. It retains its status as a decentralised EU body with headquarters in Warsaw. The name change is largely symbolic, reflecting a continuation of existing activities with expanded tasks and resources.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The agency&amp;rsquo;s staff will increase significantly, and a rapid reaction pool of European border guards will be established. The agency&amp;rsquo;s budget has also increased, allowing for greater investment in equipment. Among its expanded tasks, the agency will conduct vulnerability assessments of Member States&amp;rsquo; border control capabilities, issuing binding recommendations and deploying liaison officers for monitoring and reporting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While command and control during joint operations remain with the host Member State, they are now obligated to consider and follow the Frontex coordinating officer&amp;rsquo;s views. Furthermore, the agency&amp;rsquo;s role in supporting Member States at hotspots has been codified, including tasks such as screening, registering, and providing information to third-country nationals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Concerns have been raised about the potential overlap with the European Asylum Support Office and the extent to which EU agencies can influence Member States&amp;rsquo; decisions on entry, international protection, or the return of migrants. However, the regulation acknowledges the importance of hotspots and the role of agencies without offering clear delineations of responsibility. The practical implementation and collaboration among different actors remain to be seen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Situations requiring urgent action – right to intervene?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the most contentious aspects of the regulation is the handling of emergency situations at external borders, particularly when Member States are unwilling to act. While the initial proposal by the Commission, suggesting an agency &amp;ldquo;right to intervene,&amp;rdquo; faced criticism, the final regulation provides a more nuanced approach.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In emergency situations where a Member State fails to comply with recommendations or faces significant challenges without requesting assistance, the Council, through an implementing act, can authorize the agency to take necessary measures. This decision is binding on the Member State, potentially limiting their autonomy in border control.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While the Member State is still required to agree on the operational plan, their consent might be considered obligatory in such situations to avoid hindering emergency procedures. Although the host Member State retains command and control during operations, the involvement of multiple entities and the potential pressure arising from the Council decision raise questions about the true nature of their consent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Notably, failure to cooperate with the agency during emergencies can have consequences for the Member State. The amended Schengen Borders Code allows the Council to recommend the reintroduction of internal border controls if a Member State&amp;rsquo;s actions endanger the Schengen area&amp;rsquo;s functioning or pose a threat to public policy or internal security. This mechanism, triggered 30 days after the Council&amp;rsquo;s decision, implies that non-compliance with the EBCG can lead to temporary exclusion from the free movement area, making cooperation a condition for solidarity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is important to note that while the regulation establishes a legal obligation for Member States to cooperate during emergencies, there are no mechanisms for enforcing this duty or deploying EBCG teams against a Member State&amp;rsquo;s will. The primary recourse seems to be encouraging other Member States to implement internal border controls.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Human Rights complaints mechanism and accountability&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Initially, Frontex&amp;rsquo;s founding regulation lacked provisions for fundamental rights (FR). Over time, FR obligations have been incorporated, culminating in a dedicated FR strategy, a consultative forum, and an FR officer. The new regulation strengthens these efforts, including FR in reporting and evaluation schemes and outlining FR obligations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A significant addition is the introduction of a formal FR complaints mechanism, addressing a long-standing demand from various bodies. This mechanism allows individuals affected by EBCG operations to file complaints regarding FR violations. The FR officer manages the complaints, determines admissibility, and directs them to either the Executive Director or the relevant national authority for a decision and follow-up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The mechanism&amp;rsquo;s effectiveness hinges on the FR officer&amp;rsquo;s resources and institutional independence. Concerns remain regarding the enforcement of follow-up actions, the potential impact on other remedies, and the lack of an independent appeals procedure. The absence of clear guidelines on attributing responsibility in multi-actor scenarios further complicates matters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The regulation emphasizes the need for enhanced accountability alongside the agency&amp;rsquo;s expanded powers. However, the FR framework remains largely unchanged, with responsibility for disciplinary action and civil liability remaining with the respective Member States. While the agency is subject to non-contractual liability under EU law, the lack of clarity regarding responsibility in specific operational scenarios raises concerns about transparency and accountability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Outlook&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The implementation of the new EBCG regulation represents a significant shift in EU external border control. While not a complete overhaul, it introduces a more assertive role for the agency, increasing its influence over Member States&amp;rsquo; border management practices. The emphasis on cooperation, particularly during emergencies, underscores the shared responsibility for safeguarding the Schengen area.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Despite improvements, concerns persist regarding the potential erosion of Member States&amp;rsquo; sovereignty, the effectiveness of the complaints mechanism, and the need for greater clarity on accountability in multi-actor scenarios. The true impact of these changes will unfold over time, requiring careful monitoring and ongoing evaluation. Ultimately, the success of this new chapter in EU border control hinges on striking a delicate balance between strengthened border security and upholding fundamental rights.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Is it possible to suspend Schengen due to Greece? Is it necessary to do so?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-possible-to-suspend-schengen-due-to-greece-is-it-necessary-to-do-so/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jun 2024 18:22:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-possible-to-suspend-schengen-due-to-greece-is-it-necessary-to-do-so/</guid><description>&lt;p>A recent leak of a Council document proposes a potential suspension of the Schengen system for a duration of up to two years. This proposal stems from what are being termed &amp;ldquo;systemic deficiencies&amp;rdquo; in Greece&amp;rsquo;s management of its external borders, particularly concerning the influx of refugees and migrants. Such a suspension would provide any Schengen country the option to reinstate or implement border controls along their shared internal borders. While it&amp;rsquo;s unlikely that every Schengen country would exercise this option, it&amp;rsquo;s anticipated that several would choose to do so, especially given that a number already have active border controls in place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This development comes on the heels of a report in the Financial Times, indicating that certain Member States are contemplating the possibility of excluding Greece from Schengen due to concerns over its handling of refugees and migrants at its external borders.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While it&amp;rsquo;s plausible that this threat of suspending Schengen is specifically directed at Greece, the ambiguity of the language leaves room for interpretation. Another possibility is that the intention is to threaten a suspension of the entire Schengen system, strategically placing the blame on Greece. Irrespective of the true intent, such a threat is fundamentally flawed, both from a legal and political standpoint.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Legal Dimensions&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Completely dismantling the Schengen system without amending the EU Treaties is not possible, given the multiple references to it within those treaties. However, there are provisions for two forms of suspension: short-term (up to three months) and long-term (up to two years). The leaked Council document points to the potential utilization of the long-term suspension option.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Short-term waivers have always been an integral part of the Schengen system. These waivers permit individual Member States to temporarily reimpose checks at their internal borders when public policy or security concerns arise. Over the years, Member States have frequently invoked these provisions, typically for brief durations during major international events. However, with the ongoing refugee crisis, these provisions have been invoked more frequently and for more extended periods this autumn. A legal challenge is imminent if Member States intend to prolong these controls beyond the coming spring, as the reintroduction is limited to a maximum of six months.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 2013, as a response to the &amp;ldquo;Arab Spring&amp;rdquo; and disagreements between Italy and France over responsibility for Tunisian migrants, the Schengen rules underwent modifications. These amendments introduced provisions for the collective reimposition of internal border controls for a period of up to two years. To fully grasp the implications, these amendments should be interpreted in conjunction with the existing rules they modified. The codified version, inclusive of amendments, can be found in the annex of the report I compiled for the SIEPS think tank, which focuses on the revised rules.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While the 2013 amendments were widely understood to essentially provide for the potential suspension of individual Member States from Schengen, this isn&amp;rsquo;t explicitly stated in the regulations. The leaked Council document appears to have broader intentions, as it explicitly refers to the continuation of existing border controls between countries like Germany and Austria, not solely between other Member States and Greece. Nevertheless, the role of individual Member States remains pertinent because this collective suspension of Schengen can only be triggered if &amp;ldquo;serious deficiencies&amp;rdquo; exist in how a Member State enforces the Schengen external border rules.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Typically, the process would commence with a recommendation from the Commission following a Schengen evaluation, adhering to the distinct rules (also amended in 2013) that govern the assessment of whether Schengen states are fulfilling their obligations. Should the Commission&amp;rsquo;s report identify &amp;ldquo;serious deficiencies&amp;rdquo; in a Member State&amp;rsquo;s adherence to its external border control obligations, it can recommend &amp;ldquo;specific measures&amp;rdquo; for that country to take. These could include accepting assistance from Frontex, the EU&amp;rsquo;s border agency, and presenting plans for Frontex&amp;rsquo;s assessment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If insufficient progress is made within three months to address these concerns, the situation can escalate. In exceptional cases where public policy or public security within the Schengen area, or parts of it, faces a &amp;ldquo;serious threat,&amp;rdquo; the Council, as a last resort, can recommend to Member States that they reimpose border controls against the Member State in question. These controls can be implemented for periods of six months, renewable up to the maximum duration of two years. There&amp;rsquo;s an argument to be made that this process could be expedited and applied even without granting the Member State the full three months to rectify its shortcomings. Since a qualified majority vote from Member States in the Council is required, it&amp;rsquo;s safe to assume that most Member States would likely uphold such a recommendation. While the Council must act upon a proposal from the Commission, Member States have the right to request the Commission to draft such a proposal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When adopting this recommendation, the Council is obligated to assess whether it will adequately address the threat to public policy and determine the proportionality of the measure in relation to the threat. This assessment must be grounded in comprehensive information and take into account any EU assistance provided or potentially requested, the probable impact of the border control deficiencies on the public policy or security threat, and the ramifications for the free movement of people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Legality of Suspending Schengen and/or Sanctioning Greece&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The current status of the process concerning Greece remains unclear. While the Commission recently adopted a Schengen evaluation report, it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been made public. It&amp;rsquo;s even uncertain whether the report specifically pertains to Greece, as evaluations are conducted for all Schengen states. Consequently, unless the process is expedited, it would take a minimum of three months from the point of a formal &amp;ldquo;serious deficiencies&amp;rdquo; finding—which, to my knowledge, hasn&amp;rsquo;t occurred yet—before any sanctions could be levied against Greece.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It appears, however, that the Council document aims to fast-track this process, urging the Council to preemptively request a Commission recommendation to suspend the abolishment of border controls for a duration of up to two years. Given that there hasn&amp;rsquo;t been a formal determination of &amp;ldquo;serious deficiencies&amp;rdquo; on the part of Greece, the prerequisite three-month period during which those problems persist hasn&amp;rsquo;t even commenced. Moreover, the Council document doesn&amp;rsquo;t even attempt to address whether the substantive criteria are met; the objective appears to be simply finding a justification for extending the duration of the internal border checks that Member States have recently reinstated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Should the current threats escalate to the point of a Council Recommendation to reimpose border controls, it&amp;rsquo;s unclear whether Greece would have grounds to sue the Council in the EU Court of Justice (given that Recommendations aren&amp;rsquo;t legally binding). Alternatively, Greece might have to sue individual Member States for adhering to the Recommendation. Individual travelers could also potentially sue Member States in national courts for implementing border controls, indirectly challenging the legality of the Recommendation, which could then be referred to the Court of Justice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Procedural matters aside, is there a legitimate basis for suspending Schengen rules and reinstating border controls due to &amp;ldquo;serious deficiencies&amp;rdquo; stemming from Greece&amp;rsquo;s management of its external border? There are significant doubts about the existence of such grounds for two primary reasons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Firstly, according to the Financial Times article, other Member States are discontent because Greece declined Frontex assistance, failed to register a sufficient number of asylum-seekers, and didn&amp;rsquo;t request humanitarian aid. While the EU border control legislation addresses the refusal of Frontex support, the other issues are not covered. There&amp;rsquo;s a compelling reason for this omission: the inability to regulate the influx of refugees at external borders does not constitute a violation of Schengen rules.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This assertion might seem unexpected given that critics of the EU&amp;rsquo;s response to the refugee crisis, regardless of their stance, often presume that EU law mandates the refusal of entry to refugees and asylum-seekers at its borders. One side criticizes the EU for permitting entry to refugees and asylum-seekers, accusing it of failing to safeguard its borders. Conversely, the other side condemns the EU for constructing a &amp;ldquo;Fortress Europe.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Both sides are demonstrably mistaken, at least concerning this specific legal matter. This is evident from the Schengen Borders Code itself, which explicitly exempts refugees from penalties associated with unauthorized entry for non-EU citizens and includes an exemption from standard border crossing conditions for non-EU citizens seeking asylum. This is further corroborated by the EU&amp;rsquo;s asylum procedures Directive, which mandates that Member States process asylum applications submitted not only within their territories but also at their borders. It&amp;rsquo;s important to acknowledge that Member States don&amp;rsquo;t always fully comply with their EU legal obligations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The controversy, therefore, lies with the border crossing rule itself, not with Greece&amp;rsquo;s alleged failure to enforce it. The rule presents a practical political challenge, either because it&amp;rsquo;s perceived as ineffective in stemming the flow of people (from one perspective) or because it&amp;rsquo;s deemed too difficult for legitimate refugees to reach EU territory without facing the risk of drowning or resorting to smugglers (from the other perspective).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, when assessing whether Greece exhibits &amp;ldquo;serious deficiencies&amp;rdquo; in its management of external borders, the crucial point is that Greece is not in breach of any obligation to prevent asylum-seekers from crossing its external borders simply because no such obligation exists. In fact, the opposite is true. The sheer volume of arrivals makes it challenging for Greece to maintain a functional asylum system, but this shortcoming is subject to a separate process altogether. The European Court of Human Rights and the CJEU have previously ruled that Member States cannot return asylum-seekers to Greece due to the effective collapse of its asylum system. The Dublin III Regulation outlines regulations for instances where the Dublin system requires suspension for such reasons, and the EU recently adopted Decisions (discussed elsewhere) aimed at alleviating the burden on Greece by relocating some asylum-seekers from the country.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Undeniably, a portion of those who cross the Greek border don&amp;rsquo;t immediately apply for asylum or are subsequently unsuccessful in their asylum applications. According to UNHCR data, approximately half of the recent arrivals on the Greek island of Lesvos, a primary destination, originate from Syria and Iraq (countries with high refugee recognition rates), while the other half come from countries with lower recognition rates. In this context, it&amp;rsquo;s reasonable to suggest that Greece should welcome assistance from Frontex and other EU agencies, particularly recognizing Frontex&amp;rsquo;s role in coordinating the fingerprinting and registration of individuals upon their arrival. It&amp;rsquo;s crucial to note that fingerprinting irregular migrants and asylum-seekers isn&amp;rsquo;t a reactionary, authoritarian response to the refugee crisis, but a longstanding legal obligation within the EU, dating back to 2003.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second concern pertains to the connection between the alleged Greek &amp;ldquo;deficiencies&amp;rdquo; and the reimposition of border controls, either targeting Greece specifically or between other Schengen states. There&amp;rsquo;s no apparent link between these &amp;ldquo;deficiencies&amp;rdquo; and the borders separating Greece from other Schengen States, as none of these are land borders, and (potential) asylum-seekers and refugees primarily travel by land between Greece and other Member States. Therefore, scrutinizing individuals flying between Greece and other Schengen States would be a disproportionate response to the purported deficiencies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What about the border controls between other Schengen States? The Council document explicitly advocates for the continuation of these controls. In this instance, a connection exists between those who initially entered through Greece and later attempt to cross borders such as that between Austria and Germany. However, the fundamental deficiencies lie within the EU&amp;rsquo;s asylum system, not with Greek border control measures, as EU regulations provide for the admission of asylum-seekers. Asylum-seekers move on to other Member States because the Dublin rules were not designed for the current influx of asylum-seekers, and Greece lacks the capacity to manage the numbers it would be responsible for under these regulations. While this presents a legitimate problem, it isn&amp;rsquo;t rooted in shortcomings in Greece&amp;rsquo;s external border controls. Addressing this problem necessitates the utilization of the legal instruments available under the EU&amp;rsquo;s asylum policy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Political Landscape&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although not explicitly stated, the political subtext of the Council paper might involve pressuring Greece into accepting further border control measures. This is apparent from the Financial Times article, which highlights various allegations leveled against Greece by Member States. In response, the Greek government has defended its actions and counter-accused the EU, as outlined in an article in The Guardian.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This situation bears resemblance to the efforts made by certain Member States earlier this year to coerce Greece into a &amp;ldquo;temporary&amp;rdquo; exit from the euro. As previously argued, this strategy lacked any legal basis unless one subscribes to the unconventional argument that Greece&amp;rsquo;s eurozone membership was never legally established.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, there are distinctions in the context of Schengen. A process for the temporary suspension of Schengen rules exists on paper; the contention arises in the interpretation of these rules. Some might disagree with the interpretation offered here, arguing that deficiencies in the asylum system are implicitly factored into the assessment of &amp;ldquo;serious deficiencies&amp;rdquo; in external border control. In the absence of legal precedent, it remains to be seen which interpretation would prevail. It&amp;rsquo;s also uncertain whether the Commission, a staunch advocate for Schengen, would be willing to endorse a two-year suspension.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even if threatening Greece in this manner is legally permissible, the question of its wisdom remains. The EU faced significant criticism for attempting to bully Greece regarding the euro, even though it was technically the &amp;ldquo;Eurogroup&amp;rdquo; bodies, operating outside the formal EU political structure, rather than the EU institutions themselves, making the threats.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A more prudent course of action for the EU would be to intensify its efforts to support both Greece and the affected individuals by ensuring adequate reception centers and living conditions within the country. Additionally, the EU should prioritize improving the effectiveness of the relocation system and collaborate with Turkey to meaningfully enhance the living conditions of refugees residing there, thereby reducing the impetus for their departure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Concerning Schengen, if a temporary suspension is deemed essential, a more transparent approach would be to introduce a legislative amendment to the Schengen Borders Code, incorporating a &amp;ldquo;sunset clause&amp;rdquo; to ensure its eventual expiration, as a permanent suspension would contravene the Treaties. This would be preferable to resorting to indirect threats against Greece. Alternatively, amending the rules governing checks near internal borders could provide a basis for occasional checks in the event of dysfunctional applications of EU asylum rules, particularly if rectifying those rules proves politically unfeasible, which is a distinct possibility.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Are Your T1 Lines Saturated?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/are-your-t1-lines-saturated/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jun 2024 02:36:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/are-your-t1-lines-saturated/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>By: John Shepler&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

>&lt;/a>&lt;strong>Artificial Limitations&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Shared broadband services like Cable, DSL, 4G Cellular, or satellite internet, despite promising &amp;ldquo;best effort,&amp;rdquo; are inherently limited by technology and company policies. Each type has a maximum capacity, typically accessible round-the-clock, except for rare outages. However, users only get a fraction of this capacity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Firstly, bandwidth is capped. You&amp;rsquo;re purchasing a maximum speed, not a guaranteed one. Providers control this with rate limits. Your line might support 1000 Mbps, but you&amp;rsquo;re restricted to 10, 30, or 100 Mbps, regardless of other users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Secondly, usage limits are imposed, especially on wireless and satellite connections where bandwidth is costly. Limits like 5 or 10 GB per month severely restrict usage, and even 20 or 50 GB might be insufficient for regular business operations. Exceeding this limit can result in extra charges, disconnections, or slower speeds for the remainder of the billing cycle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Actual Limitations&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Private and dedicated internet connections usually avoid artificial limitations. These premium services ensure you&amp;rsquo;re the sole user, eliminating the need for usage policies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, technical limitations persist. Every technology has inherent constraints. &amp;ldquo;Unlimited&amp;rdquo; bandwidth is a myth, even on local networks. The goal is to have sufficient bandwidth to avoid reaching capacity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>T1 Line Saturation&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>T1 lines, offering dedicated connections between two points or to the internet, have been the business standard for decades. As the sole user, there are no usage restrictions, and the line constantly allows data transfer. You utilize and pay a fixed price for a portion or all available capacity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>T1 lines offer 1.5 Mbps bandwidth, more precisely 1.544 Mbps. However, 8 Kbps is reserved for line synchronization, leaving 1.536 Mbps for actual data – equivalent to 16.59 GB daily or nearly 500 GB monthly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Line Saturation Problems&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Your T1 line reveals its limitations when transferring large files quickly or accommodating multiple users simultaneously. With a maximum capacity of roughly 17 GB daily, transferring even 1 GB per hour becomes challenging.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Attempting to exceed this limit slows down everyone&amp;rsquo;s traffic significantly. This bottleneck hinders productivity, especially when access to information is crucial for continuing work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The situation worsens with cloud-based phone systems (VoIP). Voice data gets stuck in the bottleneck alongside other data, causing call quality issues like garbled speech, delays, and even dropped calls.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Solutions&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For occasional saturation, prioritizing traffic can be beneficial. Real-time services like calls and video conferences get top priority, followed by business applications, and finally, background tasks like backups.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ultimately, upgrading to higher bandwidth becomes necessary. Fortunately, costs have decreased significantly. Doubling your bandwidth with a second T1 line is an option. These lines can be &amp;ldquo;bonded&amp;rdquo; to act as a single, faster connection.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ethernet over Copper, using existing copper lines, offers speeds of 10 Mbps and beyond. For these speeds, Ethernet over Fiber becomes cost-effective, scaling from 10 to 100, 1000, and even 10,000 Mbps. These services allow you to start with a lower speed and pay less until full capacity is needed.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="no-more-clicking-cancel">No More Clicking &amp;ldquo;Cancel&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update:&lt;/strong> Victoria Yudin accurately pointed out that posting reports are sometimes useful or even necessary, for example, in training or when troubleshooting errors. She&amp;rsquo;s absolutely right - posting reports are definitely needed in certain situations, even in Fabrikam. I personally disabled posting reports in my testing environment because I frequently run repetitive tests on batch posting for my projects. I already know that my data, transactions, and postings are all accurate. So, in my case, I don&amp;rsquo;t need the posting reports or the dialog boxes, and I turn them off to avoid constantly clicking &amp;ldquo;Cancel.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a little disheartening to be aware of exactly how many times you have to click &amp;ldquo;Cancel&amp;rdquo; on the report dialog boxes after posting a certain Dynamics GP batch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My desire to avoid this repetitive clicking finally outweighed my laziness in disabling the reports. I finally took 10 seconds to write a script to disable all posting reports in Fabrikam:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>UPDATE TWO..SY02200 SET PRNTJRNL = 0&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And that&amp;rsquo;s it. Done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now I need to make this a standard step in my GP installation process after creating the Fabrikam company.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Have you found that your internet service, once reliable, can no longer keep up with your growing business? If a slow connection is impacting productivity and increasing frustration, it&amp;rsquo;s time for an upgrade. But what are your options?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.fibernetworkquotes.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;img src="https://www.fibernetworkquotes.com/images/ThinkingQuestion300.jpg"
loading="lazy"
alt="Should you get fiber optic Internet? Check your options now."
>&lt;/a>&lt;strong>More Choices, Less Cost&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Shopping for internet access may seem daunting, especially if your last experience was limited and expensive. You might have settled for a T1 line, DSL from the phone company, or business cable from your TV provider. Fortunately, the landscape has evolved.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The good news is that the options have significantly expanded and become more affordable. While T1 lines are still available, often at a fraction of the cost from years ago, they are still limited to 1.5 Mbps. This might suffice for the smallest businesses but will likely cause bottlenecks for most others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A more modern choice is Ethernet over Copper. Using existing telephone lines, this technology offers speeds from 1 Mbps to 15 or 20 Mbps, at approximately half the per-Mbps cost of a T1 line.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Business cable internet has also improved. With advancements in modem technology, speeds of 100 Mbps, 300 Mbps, or even 1,000 Mbps are achievable over existing coaxial cable. You might even find 1,000 Mbps service for the price of your old T1 line. However, keep in mind that cable internet bandwidth is shared, meaning speeds can fluctuate throughout the day. Upload speeds, in particular, are typically much slower than downloads.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>How About Fiber?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For many years, fiber optic internet was only accessible to large corporations. This is no longer the case. Thanks to technological advancements, particularly the shift from SONET to Ethernet over Fiber, prices have dropped significantly, and options have multiplied. Now, businesses can customize their bandwidth from 10 Mbps to 10 Gbps, paying only for what they need and easily scaling up as their needs grow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ethernet over Fiber offers speeds up to 100 Gbps, with high reliability, dedicated connections, symmetrical upload and download speeds, and easy scalability. This service is readily available from a growing number of providers actively expanding their networks. Depending on your location and the level of competition, you might even benefit from reduced or waived construction costs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>I Want Fiber. How Do I Get It?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Choosing fiber optic internet is rarely a decision businesses regret. Unlike older copper-based technologies, fiber is largely future-proof and minimizes issues like latency, packet loss, and jitter, providing the seamless connection you desire.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The easiest way to get started is to work with a bandwidth broker like Telarus. They hold contracts with numerous providers nationwide and can connect you to services around the world. You&amp;rsquo;ll pay the same or potentially less than going directly to a carrier, with the added benefit of comparing multiple options.

But what exactly does it mean and how do businesses acquire them?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unlike standard phone numbers automatically assigned with landline, VoIP, or cellular services, toll free numbers require a separate process. In the US and Canada, phone numbers follow the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) format: 1-NPA-NXX-XXXX.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this format, &amp;ldquo;1&amp;rdquo; represents the country code, NPA stands for Numbering Plan Area (area code), and the remaining digits are unique to your line. The area code often indicates a geographical location, although VoIP providers can manipulate this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Toll free numbers utilize specific area codes called toll free prefixes. While the term &amp;ldquo;toll free&amp;rdquo; implies free calls, it actually means the calling party doesn&amp;rsquo;t incur charges for the call. The owner of the toll free number is responsible for the cost of incoming calls.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To obtain a toll free number, businesses can order them from specialized companies. There are typically two payment options: a monthly fee plus per-minute charges for incoming calls, or a fixed monthly fee regardless of call volume.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Easily recognizable by their prefixes (800, 888, 877, 866, 855), toll free numbers are not tied to specific phone lines. Instead, you assign a &amp;ldquo;ring-to&amp;rdquo; number, directing incoming calls to any phone line you choose.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The popularity of toll free numbers has led to the introduction of multiple prefixes beyond the original 800, all functioning identically.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Hyper-V virtual machine running Server 2012 R2 is unable to start and displays an error message stating "We were unable to finish the updates.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-hyper-v-virtual-machine-running-server-2012-r2-is-unable-to-start-and-displays-an-error-message-stating-we-were-unable-to-finish-the-updates/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jun 2024 18:22:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-hyper-v-virtual-machine-running-server-2012-r2-is-unable-to-start-and-displays-an-error-message-stating-we-were-unable-to-finish-the-updates/</guid><description>&lt;p>By Steve Endow&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While attempting to set up the GP 2016 Web Client on a new Server 2012 R2 virtual machine, I encountered an error message stating &amp;ldquo;We couldn&amp;rsquo;t complete the updates. Undoing changes.&amp;rdquo; The VM became unresponsive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After some searching, I came across a TechNet forum thread discussing similar issues with Windows 8. Unfortunately, the suggested fix of disabling Secure Boot on the VM was unsuccessful in my case.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I eventually found a blog post by Andy Parkes that offered a solution: installing roles and features directly onto a VM&amp;rsquo;s VHD file using Server Manager. This method was new to me and proved to be effective.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following the instructions, I was able to resolve the initial issue, and the VM began applying updates. However, the update process stalled at 100%. I waited a while, but there was no indication of progress.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I decided to power down the VM, disable Secure Boot again, and restart. This time, it displayed &amp;ldquo;Undoing changes&amp;rdquo; for a few minutes before finally booting up with a &amp;ldquo;Preparing Windows&amp;rdquo; message.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, even after successfully booting, Windows Update still displayed a significant number of pending updates.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cheaper Connections To The Cloud</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/cheaper-connections-to-the-cloud/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jun 2024 15:19:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/cheaper-connections-to-the-cloud/</guid><description>&lt;p>Businesses are often quick to celebrate the cost savings of cloud services compared to maintaining their own data centers. However, there&amp;rsquo;s a hidden cost that often catches them off guard: cloud connectivity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.ethernetovercopper.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;img src="http://www.CloudNetworkingServices.com/images/CloudServicesCostB200.jpg"
loading="lazy"
alt="Check the cost of connectivity to the cloud before you make the big move."
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The current cost of bandwidth depends on a company&amp;rsquo;s blend of LAN, MAN, and WAN traffic. Businesses with data centers located in the same building as their employees usually find most of their application traffic stays on the LAN. While a dedicated broadband internet connection is necessary for external communication, a moderate line speed can accommodate a large number of users if their usage is limited to email and web browsing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>E-commerce, however, is a different story. If customer and external user traffic dominate, a high-bandwidth connection is crucial for public-facing servers. In such cases, WAN traffic may even exceed LAN traffic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Similarly, offsite but local data centers, even those primarily used for backup, recovery, or data mirroring, require high-bandwidth connections. This scenario often results in the majority of bandwidth being used by MAN rather than LAN or WAN.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The transition to the cloud significantly alters this dynamic. With public servers becoming rented services, bandwidth costs are absorbed into the service fee, potentially eliminating the need for a MAN connection altogether for cloud storage users. What becomes essential, however, is a significantly larger bandwidth pipe between the company&amp;rsquo;s premises and the cloud service provider.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Companies accustomed to in-house operations might be surprised by the increased cost of private line services to the cloud, potentially offsetting their anticipated savings. Conversely, companies currently burdened by high internet bandwidth costs may find relief in the cloud provider&amp;rsquo;s inclusive bandwidth to the internet. Creating a simple chart comparing LAN, MAN, and WAN bandwidth needs for both current and cloud-based setups is a worthwhile exercise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Regardless of the resulting bandwidth mix, maximizing value for money is key. Fortunately, there are now more options than ever before, driven by competition and technological advancements.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One such advancement is Ethernet over Copper (EoC). EoC directly rivals traditional and high-bandwidth T1 lines, and in some cases, even fiber optic services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Utilizing existing copper telephone wiring, EoC employs a more efficient modulation scheme than T1, achieving higher bandwidths. Unlike T1, EoC is distance-sensitive, requiring proximity to a telco office, making it suitable for urban and suburban areas but less so for rural locations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>EoC bandwidth options typically range from 2 to 20 Mbps, with some metropolitan areas offering services equivalent to 45 Mbps DS3. There are even providers offering 100 Mbps bandwidth over copper.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The pricing for EoC services is particularly attractive. 2-3 Mbps Ethernet service can often be acquired for the price of a T1 line, and discounts of 50% or more compared to traditional telecom services for higher bandwidth EoC are not uncommon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Whether planning a move to the cloud or seeking to reduce current line service costs, exploring &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.ethernetovercopper.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>pricing and availability of EoC and other bandwidth services&lt;/a> could reveal pleasant surprises.&lt;/p>

Unemployment is still high, companies are focusing on cost-cutting over revenue growth, and uncertainty about the future persists. Consumers are tightening their belts and spending less, leaving businesses with little choice but to do the same. It&amp;rsquo;s understandable to hesitate before making significant moves when the path ahead is unclear.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://www.T1Explainer.com/images/ArrowManDownLG.dms"
loading="lazy"
alt="Deal effectively with the down economy."
>Does this mean your business is stuck or in irreversible decline? For most, that&amp;rsquo;s an overly pessimistic outlook. However, you&amp;rsquo;re presented with a crucial decision, particularly regarding telecommunications expenses. Should you aim for the same level of service at a reduced cost, or maintain your current budget while enhancing your services?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many managers view this as a win-win situation. No matter your choice, you benefit. The only one at a potential disadvantage is an overpriced service provider who is either indifferent to your needs or hasn&amp;rsquo;t optimized their own operations to provide you with a better deal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A prudent first step is to carefully evaluate your company&amp;rsquo;s requirements for the upcoming year. Do your current services align with your needs, or do you require adjustments? For instance, if your phone lines aren&amp;rsquo;t constantly busy, reducing the number of outside lines could be a wise decision. Similarly, downsizing might mean your broadband capacity exceeds your current needs. Aligning your telecom services with your present situation can lead to substantial savings. In certain cases, integrating your telephone and broadband services through options like a T1 line or SIP trunk could yield even greater savings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You might worry that reducing bandwidth could pose a risk if business activity suddenly surges. Scalable bandwidth services like Metro Ethernet can mitigate this concern. You could have a connection with a 50 Mbps capacity while only paying for 10 Mbps. If your needs double, a simple call to your provider can instantly upgrade your service to 20 Mbps without any hardware changes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Certain businesses are well-positioned for growth, but face obstacles like limited loan availability or reluctance to commit to long-term expenses that might become burdensome if anticipated growth doesn&amp;rsquo;t materialize. However, it&amp;rsquo;s possible to enhance your services without increasing spending. This often applies to companies locked into outdated leased line service agreements, paying high prices while remaining unaware of more cost-effective options. Telecom service rates have experienced significant declines in recent years, yet many providers don&amp;rsquo;t proactively offer better deals to existing customers.

&lt;p>In a legal opinion issued on February 20, 2021, Advocate General Hogan addressed a crucial procedural issue: Can a non-EU country legally challenge EU actions before the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU)? This question holds significance because the Court has never directly ruled on it within the context of sanctions, and it delves into the principles governing the relationship between EU law and other international law subjects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The case is an appeal against a General Court ruling from September 20, 2019, where the Court was asked to determine if Venezuela could challenge restrictive measures. These measures banned providing arms, military, and surveillance equipment to any individuals or entities in Venezuela.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Answering this question requires examining whether the conditions outlined in Article 263(4) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) are met. This article addresses the standing to bring direct actions for annulment of EU law by entities other than EU member states or institutions. In this instance, the answer hinges on whether Venezuela is legally considered a &amp;ldquo;person&amp;rdquo; directly and individually impacted by these measures. Alternatively, if the measures are deemed regulatory, it&amp;rsquo;s sufficient to demonstrate that they directly concern Venezuela without requiring implementing measures. The General Court concluded that Venezuela was not directly affected, lacking standing under Article 263(4) TFEU. However, they didn&amp;rsquo;t address whether Venezuela qualifies as a legal &amp;ldquo;person&amp;rdquo; according to the same provision.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Advocate General focused on two primary issues to address the legal standing question: first, whether Venezuela qualifies as a legal &amp;ldquo;person&amp;rdquo; under Article 263(4) TFEU; and second, whether the measures directly concern Venezuela as per the same article. The Advocate General suggested that the CJEU affirm both points. If the Court follows this recommendation, it could strengthen the perception of the EU as a globally responsible actor upholding the rule of law and effective legal protection. This would essentially acknowledge that non-EU countries have the right to challenge EU laws affecting them in EU courts if the conditions of Article 263(4) TFEU are met, even without reciprocal agreements. This post focuses on the Advocate General&amp;rsquo;s analysis of &amp;ldquo;legal personhood,&amp;rdquo; as the &amp;ldquo;direct concern&amp;rdquo; aspect has been discussed elsewhere.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Does Article 263(4) TFEU recognize Venezuela as a legal &amp;ldquo;person&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to the Advocate General, both international and EU law considerations support recognizing Venezuela as a legal &amp;ldquo;person&amp;rdquo; for the purposes of Article 263(4) TFEU.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>International Law Considerations&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Regarding international law, the Advocate General rightly dismissed the Council&amp;rsquo;s argument that the principle of state immunity prevents Venezuela from bringing a lawsuit before the CJEU. The Advocate General contended that state immunity cannot restrict Venezuela&amp;rsquo;s legal standing because Venezuela is the plaintiff, not the defendant in this case. Under international law, state immunity aims to help states and their representatives carry out their public functions by preventing legal actions against them in foreign courts. However, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t prevent third-party states from being plaintiffs in foreign courts, as clearly stated in Article 8 of the 2004 UN Convention on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and their Property.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the remaining arguments based on international law seem less robust and more convoluted. The Advocate General posited that the international law principle of comity should guide the interpretation of &amp;ldquo;legal person&amp;rdquo; under Article 263(4) TFEU. Based on comity, the CJEU should be open to challenges from states acting in their sovereign capacity as international legal persons. It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that if the Court addresses this point, it would mark the first direct ruling on whether international legal personality automatically qualifies an entity as a &amp;ldquo;legal person&amp;rdquo; for annulment actions. The Polisario Front, a national liberation movement with potential international legal personality, previously raised this argument in the &lt;em>Front Polisario v Council&lt;/em> case. However, the General Court avoided engaging with it, ruling on Polisario&amp;rsquo;s legal personality solely based on EU law.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From an international law perspective, the Advocate General&amp;rsquo;s argument is unconvincing. No customary international law compels one state to allow another to sue in its courts. Comity is a domestic legal principle, primarily used in US courts, that grants deference to foreign states to be plaintiffs in domestic courts. The Advocate General cited the US Supreme Court&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>Banco National de Cuba v Sabbatino&lt;/em> judgment and other relevant case law (&lt;em>The Sapphire&lt;/em>; &lt;em>Hilton v Guyot&lt;/em>; &lt;em>The Santissima Trinidad&lt;/em> – all US Supreme Court judgments) to support the domestic origin of the comity principle. However, the Advocate General didn&amp;rsquo;t demonstrate how this domestic principle became part of international law. Using domestic cases to make generalizations about international law requires caution. The very concept of &amp;ldquo;comity&amp;rdquo; in international law relates to discretionary practices, contradicting the modern understanding of customary international law as &amp;ldquo;evidence of a general practice accepted as law&amp;rdquo; (Article 38(1)(b) ICJ Statute).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Despite the international law misstep, a valid question arises: are there compelling reasons to adopt this doctrine within EU law? While comity differs from international law, it&amp;rsquo;s an internationally relevant principle shaping a state&amp;rsquo;s external relations. Showing deference to third-party states as litigants before the CJEU aligns with Articles 3(5) and 21 TEU, solidifying the EU&amp;rsquo;s image as a reliable and internationally engaged entity committed to the rule of law.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>EU Law considerations&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Advocate General also referenced EU law precedents where the CJEU indirectly acknowledged that third-party states have legal standing to file for annulment under Article 263(4) TFEU, though these rulings weren&amp;rsquo;t in the context of restrictive measures like the current case (&lt;em>Cambodia and CRF v Commission&lt;/em>, para. 51; &lt;em>Poland v Commission&lt;/em>, paras. 51,52; &lt;em>Switzerland v Commission&lt;/em>, para. 22). Regarding restrictive measures, the Advocate General highlighted the Court&amp;rsquo;s judgment in &lt;em>PKK and NKK v Council&lt;/em>, suggesting that even without legal personality, an entity directly and individually affected by such measures must be able to access EU courts to protect its rights. Based on these precedents and considering the core EU law principles of upholding the rule of law and effective legal protection, the Advocate General concluded that Venezuela should be considered a legal &amp;ldquo;person&amp;rdquo; under Article 263(4) TFEU. This applies even without reciprocity, as respect for these principles isn&amp;rsquo;t based on reciprocity and shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be subject to diplomatic bargaining or reciprocal treaty obligations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This part of the Advocate General&amp;rsquo;s opinion is particularly compelling, especially considering the Court&amp;rsquo;s relevant case law. In &lt;em>PKK and NKK v Council&lt;/em>, the Court emphasized that procedural rules governing annulment actions should avoid &amp;ldquo;excessive formalism,&amp;rdquo; which could deny an entity subject to restrictive measures the chance to seek annulment. It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that denying Venezuela, a sovereign state and a prime example of an international legal person, the ability to initiate annulment proceedings while granting this right to entities like the Polisario Front and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam might raise concerns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While acknowledging the merits of the Advocate General&amp;rsquo;s approach to legal personhood, potential implications for EU foreign relations arise. Would allowing third-party states to challenge EU laws before the CJEU inundate the Court with politically charged questions about recognizing entities like Kosovo and Palestine? This fear seems exaggerated. As US courts have applied the comity doctrine, exceptions exist for states not recognized by the US. This ensures that while the CJEU demonstrates openness to reviewing measures affecting third-party states, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be used to decide on potentially contentious recognition issues.&lt;/p>

What if you could save significantly on your monthly telecom bills without compromising quality? This might be easier than you think.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This article assumes your business uses at least a T1 line for phone and/or internet, which is common for most businesses beyond small offices or home setups. While many companies rely on traditional telecom providers, they may not be the most cost-effective option anymore.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The telecom market has transformed with the emergence of regional and national carriers increasing competition. Tools like GeoQuote (tm) make it easy to compare quotes from multiple carriers, driving prices down.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another major shift is the move from traditional networks to newer technologies like MPLS and Carrier Ethernet. Competitive carriers often excel in these areas as they are not burdened by outdated infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, what cost reductions are we talking about? T1 line prices have dropped significantly, potentially costing half of what your current contract demands, especially in competitive metropolitan areas. Even more impressive are the savings when comparing Ethernet to older DS3 or OCx services for bandwidth. Switching to Ethernet can cut bandwidth costs by 50% or more if your building is equipped for fiber optic service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This convergence of increased competition, improved search tools, and advanced technology offers significant cost savings without compromising performance or reliability. Dedicating a few minutes to exploring these options could lead to substantial annual savings for your company. Compare your current expenses by obtaining an instant online service quote.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Our consultant team can provide you with the most up-to-date special offers and services not yet available through the GeoQuote tool. Request a call to receive this additional information.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Noah Sanders, who wrote &lt;em>Born-Again Dirt: Farming to the Glory of God&lt;/em>, is hosting another one of his &lt;em>Redeeming The Dirt&lt;/em> conferences in Alabama.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Brian Oldreive, the founder of &lt;em>Foundations For Farming&lt;/em>, will be speaking at the conference. &lt;em>Foundations For Farming&lt;/em> is a Christian ministry based in Africa that teaches people, mainly the poor, how to become self-sufficient through growing their own food. I&amp;rsquo;ve written about &lt;em>Foundations For Farming&lt;/em> several times on my previous blog. You can read one of those posts &lt;a class="link" href="http://thedeliberateagrarian.blogspot.com/2014/05/gold-potatoes-in-zimbabwe.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since we&amp;rsquo;re talking about &lt;em>Foundations For Farming&lt;/em>, I want to suggest a YouTube video that features Johann van der Ham discussing the &lt;em>Foundations For Farming&lt;/em> method. It&amp;rsquo;s one of my favorites. At the 4:39 mark, Mr. van der Ham delivers a beautiful two-minute monologue of awe and admiration for a sunflower, and it never gets old.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s so much beauty in this flawed world, if we only open our eyes to see it. Mr. van der Ham concludes by asking, &amp;ldquo;How magnificent will it be when God makes all things new?&amp;rdquo; This is a question for those of us on our own Upland journeys to contemplate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Returning to the &lt;em>Redeeming The Dirt&lt;/em> Conference&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Joel Salatin, the renowned farming expert, will also be present. I probably don&amp;rsquo;t need to introduce you to Joel, but I will mention that he&amp;rsquo;s written a new book that I highly recommend. You can find my thoughts on it here: &lt;a class="link" href="http://thedeliberateagrarian.blogspot.com/2016/05/its-down-to-earth-theological-tour-de.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>While I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with eConnect integrations extensively, I recently encountered a situation where I needed to update existing Dynamics GP Note records. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t recall having done this before, and online searches didn&amp;rsquo;t provide any solutions. If you know of an easier approach, please share, as I&amp;rsquo;m curious if I&amp;rsquo;ve overlooked something.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s imagine your .NET eConnect integration needs to update a customer&amp;rsquo;s address and phone number, and simultaneously append an update message to the existing customer note. Seems straightforward, right?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, using the eConnect taUpdateCreateCustomerRcd NOTETEXT field overwrites any existing customer note. Despite exploring documentation and searching for ways to programmatically update existing GP notes, including standard zDP and eConnect &amp;ldquo;ta&amp;rdquo; stored procedures, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any direct methods. While the SY03900 note table itself is simple, a more convenient way to update notes would be beneficial.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You could create a single SQL stored procedure, but I wanted to avoid adding another custom procedure for this client.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another option is an eConnect Post procedure, but I find them cumbersome. They resemble custom stored procedures, which I wanted to avoid, and often need to be recreated after GP service packs or upgrades, making them easy to forget.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyway&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, ensure the customer record exists in the SY03900 table. While new customer records are automatically assigned a NOTEINDX value, a corresponding record in SY03900 isn&amp;rsquo;t automatically created. Trying to update the note for customer ACME001 in SY03900 without an existing record will fail.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I created a quick SQL snippet to check for an existing Note record and create one if needed:&lt;/p>

This involves nanowires covered in zinc oxide that transform mechanical energy into electrical energy, illustrating the scientific principle of energy conversion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The creator of this innovation suggests incorporating it into clothing like shirts and shoes to power devices like iPods or medical implants. Currently, the power density is 80 milliwatts per square meter of fabric, but this could increase significantly in the future, potentially reaching several watts per garment, especially with more vigorous movements.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While using this technology to charge an iPod while walking is appealing for reducing carbon emissions, imagine the possibilities of recharging hybrid cars at stoplights or even powering homes. The implications for energy independence and environmental protection are significant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Taking this further, envision wearable integrated circuits woven into clothing, similar to electric blankets. By combining existing miniaturized wireless technology with power-generating fabric, clothing could become mobile WiFi nodes, creating a dynamic network that fluctuates with people&amp;rsquo;s movements and activities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This mesh network could provide widespread wireless broadband coverage, addressing the power supply issues of traditional methods. The network&amp;rsquo;s strength would vary throughout the day, peaking during work and school hours and adapting as people change clothes and move about.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Within this network, individuals become walking power sources, routers, and communication hubs. Clothing could even integrate network voice features, essentially becoming &amp;ldquo;softswitches&amp;rdquo; for making calls over the Internet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Expanding this concept, even animals could contribute to broadband coverage. Imagine large animals with their considerable surface area acting as mobile transmitters, extending network access to remote areas and underserved populations. However, the logistics of outfitting certain animals with such technology present a challenge.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>EV-DO Expands In The Face of WiMAX</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ev-do-expands-in-the-face-of-wimax/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jun 2024 23:06:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ev-do-expands-in-the-face-of-wimax/</guid><description>&lt;p>The arrival of 4G technology, specifically Sprint&amp;rsquo;s nationwide WiMAX network, raises questions about the future of 3G. While WiMAX boasts speeds up to 70 Mbps, suggesting a potential shift, the reality is more nuanced.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sprint&amp;rsquo;s commitment to a national WiMAX network, with its impressive 31-mile range and 70 Mbps bandwidth, signals a potential shift in mobile technology. Realistically, users can expect speeds around 2-4 Mbps, especially when mobile. This rivals the current leading 3G service, EV-DO.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Developed by Qualcomm, EV-DO, short for &amp;ldquo;Evolution - Data Optimized,&amp;rdquo; is a standard for CDMA cellular transmission. It provides internet access and video on demand alongside traditional voice services. Major carriers like Verizon (BroadbandAccess and VCAST) and Sprint (Amp&amp;rsquo;d Mobile) have embraced EV-DO.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>EV-DO, with download speeds of 2.4 Mbps and upload speeds of 153 Kbps, is comparable to DSL, cable, and satellite internet. Users typically experience 400-700 Kbps download speeds, sufficient for multimedia messaging, email, web browsing, and video/audio downloads.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>EV-DO evolved from 1xRTT, offering speeds of 60-80 Kbps. While faster than dial-up, it struggles with bandwidth-heavy applications. This evolution is crucial as 1xRTT remains prevalent on CDMA networks, with EV-DO still being deployed beyond major cities and airports.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>EV-DO Rev A, a backward-compatible upgrade, boosts peak download speeds to 3.1 Mbps and upload speeds to 1.8 Mbps. It also introduces Quality of Service (QoS) support, reducing latency for applications like push-to-talk, instant messaging, and potentially VoIP, although carriers remain cautious due to existing voice services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As Sprint and Verizon upgrade to EV-DO Rev A, the next iteration, Rev B, is on the horizon. Launching next year, Rev B enhances performance to 4.9 Mbps per channel, with up to 15 channels working concurrently for a theoretical 73.5 Mbps download and 27 Mbps upload speed. Importantly, it maintains backward compatibility with previous versions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This similarity between Rev B&amp;rsquo;s 73.5 Mbps and WiMAX&amp;rsquo;s 70 Mbps begs the question: is 3G evolving into 4G? In a sense, yes. Verizon, lacking independent WiMAX licenses, benefits significantly from this evolution. Ultimately, this bandwidth expansion paves the way for wireless applications previously restricted by limited airlink channels.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Traditionally, businesses have faced a trade-off between expensive, high-performance WAN bandwidth and affordable, but unreliable, low-performance options. While cable or DSL internet offers cost savings, their inconsistent performance can be problematic. Conversely, dedicated private lines or MPLS networks deliver reliability and performance at a premium cost. If only there were a solution to make the internet perform like an MPLS network at a fraction of the cost. Thanks to SDN, there is.&lt;/p>

alt="SDN networks can manage Internet connections to replace MPLS networks."
>&lt;strong>What SDN is All About&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SDN, which stands for Software Defined Network, represents the forefront of telecommunications connectivity. You might also come across terms like Hybrid SDN or SDN-WAN, which highlight its ability to combine different network types. Let&amp;rsquo;s explore what these acronyms signify and how they can benefit you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SDN distinguishes itself from conventional hardware-based networks, like those used for telephone systems and the internet backbone, by using software to control network behavior. Traditional IP networks rely on routers and switches to determine data paths, while MPLS networks utilize specialized label switches to create a fixed network structure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In contrast, SDN shifts network intelligence from inflexible hardware to software. This software program dynamically manages the hardware components, determining how they route traffic in real-time. SDN-WAN specifically refers to a Wide Area Network managed by SDN principles. It can integrate internet connections, private lines, and MPLS networks into a single, virtual WAN.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>What’s Holding Back The Internet?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The internet&amp;rsquo;s allure as a low-cost connectivity solution has been hard to resist, but it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to remember that it was never designed to replace dedicated circuit-switched networks. The internet&amp;rsquo;s strength lies in its ability to reliably deliver data packets, regardless of network hiccups. TCP/IP ensures data integrity but doesn&amp;rsquo;t guarantee delivery speed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a result, internet users often experience performance fluctuations that, while merely inconvenient for casual browsing, can severely impact businesses running cloud-based applications. Voice and video communication, in particular, suffer from network neutrality, which treats all data equally. This lack of prioritization means VoIP packets compete with large file transfers, leading to choppy conversations and dropped calls.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Making The Internet Great For Business&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A closer examination reveals that most internet performance bottlenecks occur in &amp;ldquo;the last mile&amp;rdquo; connections, not the core network. Compromises made to keep connection costs down are often the culprit. For example, DSL and Cable, the most affordable broadband options, utilize shared bandwidth with varying upload and download speeds. This means users have little control over bandwidth availability, latency, packet loss, or overall reliability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dedicated Internet Access (DIA) offers a step up in reliability. Options like T1 lines, DS3 bandwidth, OCx SONET, Ethernet over Copper, and Fiber Optic Carrier Ethernet provide a more robust connection. However, this stability comes at a cost, often ranging from two to ten times that of basic broadband.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Where Do Private Lines and MPLS Fit In?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Building a private internet network using dedicated private lines offers the pinnacle of performance, with high bandwidth, low latency, minimal jitter and packet loss, and maximum availability. However, this approach becomes prohibitively expensive as distance and the number of locations increase. MPLS networks provide a cost-effective alternative by creating a private network between designated locations, offering better performance than the public internet at a lower cost than dedicated private lines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Businesses often choose MPLS for communication between headquarters, branch offices, and data centers where performance is critical.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>How SDN Mimics MPLS at Lower Cost&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The performance of Cable Broadband solutions has drastically improved in recent years, with speeds of 100 Mbps or even 1 Gbps now available at affordable prices. However, the inherent variability of Cable, DSL, 4G Wireless, and the internet itself remains a concern.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SDN controllers address this issue by actively managing available connectivity resources. By utilizing multiple connection types, such as Cable broadband, DSL, 4G, Dedicated Internet access, private lines, and even satellite, SDN can dynamically route traffic based on real-time network conditions. It can even distribute traffic across multiple paths if a single optimal route isn&amp;rsquo;t available.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This approach allows SDN to prioritize critical applications like VoIP and video conferencing by routing them through higher-performance connections. Essentially, SDN creates classes of service within your network, a feature absent in the public internet. This results in lower costs compared to an all-private network solution. Additionally, you gain the flexibility to connect to any location globally, including customers and suppliers, through the internet&amp;rsquo;s existing infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you suspect you&amp;rsquo;re overpaying for your wide area network, now is the perfect time to explore readily available, cost-effective &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.cloudbrokerageservice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

This reliance is only expected to increase as technology advances and electronic record-keeping becomes more common. This naturally raises concerns about the rising costs associated with these growing telecom needs. However, there are ways to manage and even reduce these expenses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most fundamental requirement for any organization is voice communication. For larger facilities, this typically involves a PBX phone system. Modern PBX systems are more compact and efficient than their predecessors. Consolidating multiple analog lines into a digital ISDN PRI trunk line can result in significant cost savings. For facilities requiring more than 23 outside lines, additional T1 lines can be easily incorporated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that ISDN PRI trunk line costs have decreased considerably in recent times. Competitive service providers often offer the same level of T1 service at a lower price, allowing for cost savings or expansion of telephone capabilities within the same budget.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>IP PBX systems are becoming increasingly popular for new installations and upgrades. These systems function similarly to traditional PBXs but with the added benefit of supporting VoIP handsets. This allows for the use of SIP trunking, potentially leading to substantial cost reductions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Data communication is another critical aspect of modern healthcare facilities. High-definition imaging equipment, electronic medical records, and regular administrative tasks demand a robust data infrastructure. While a T1 line might suffice for smaller offices, larger organizations often require higher bandwidth solutions like DS3 or fiber optic connections.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Similar to voice lines, data communication costs have also decreased in recent years. Switching to lower-cost providers offering equivalent services can lead to significant savings. However, the emergence of Carrier Ethernet networks presents even greater opportunities for cost reduction. Carrier Ethernet offers a compelling alternative to traditional fiber optic services, often with cost savings of 50% or more. With bandwidth options ranging from 5 Mbps to 10 Gbps, Carrier Ethernet provides scalable and cost-effective solutions for high-bandwidth needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you manage telecommunication expenses for a healthcare facility and are looking to reduce your monthly bills, evaluating your bandwidth needs is a good place to start. You might be surprised by the potential savings available.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Poken Enhances Face to Face Social Networking</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/poken-enhances-face-to-face-social-networking/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jun 2024 20:45:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/poken-enhances-face-to-face-social-networking/</guid><description>&lt;p>Is jotting down contact information on scraps of paper your go-to method?

While things have improved in Forecaster 7.0, it&amp;rsquo;s still best to avoid special characters in name and ID fields. Recently, a period caused confusion in Forecaster again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s what happened:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>A line set was named with a period at the end (e.g., &amp;ldquo;HR.&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This line set was used as an override on an input set.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Budget data was entered for the department.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Reviewing the data in the input set (Data&amp;raquo;Input) showed no issues. However, opening the line set (Build&amp;raquo;Lines) displayed it as empty. This didn&amp;rsquo;t seem problematic until the line set needed modification. In this instance, a new account had to be added. After adding the account and saving, the input set became blank except for the new account. The line set in the database was also blank, except for the added account.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The root cause was traced back to the period at the end of the line set name. Periods within the name didn&amp;rsquo;t cause this issue. Fortunately, renaming the line set without the period before making changes could recover the data. However, if changes were saved to the blank line set, it had to be recreated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This issue was discussed with Darian Hanson from support, and hopefully, it will be addressed. This experience serves as a reminder to remain cautious of special characters, even periods.&lt;/p>

However, managing these locations as a unified company requires connecting them effectively. Point-to-point lines and MPLS networks offer solutions for this need.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Consider a car dealership expanding by acquiring another dealership. While this offers strategic advantages, consolidating operations like accounting, marketing, and IT can lead to cost savings. Centralizing these functions requires reliable and efficient connectivity between locations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With most business operations relying on data, standardized computer systems become essential. Connecting these systems at different locations is where point-to-point T1 lines come in. These dedicated lines provide a secure and private connection between two locations, regardless of distance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Point-to-point T1 lines are versatile, used by radio stations for program transmission and businesses for secure data exchange. While connecting each location directly can become costly as a business grows, a hub-and-spoke arrangement with headquarters as the central hub offers a more efficient approach.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For connecting multiple locations, MPLS (Multi Protocol Label Switching) provides a private and shared network with guaranteed bandwidth. Each location utilizes a T1 line to access the network, and the MPLS provider manages connectivity between specific locations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ultimately, choosing between point-to-point T1 and MPLS depends on a business&amp;rsquo;s connectivity, bandwidth, privacy, and budget needs. Comparing service options and costs will help determine the most suitable solution.&lt;/p>

Ethernet over Copper (EoC) connections are increasing in availability and often come at a lower cost compared to other options.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>EoC enables standard Ethernet services to be delivered through existing copper telephone wiring. Unlike typical Cat 5E or Cat 6 wiring, EoC is compatible with older copper infrastructure not initially intended for Ethernet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the main advantages of EoC is its utilization of existing copper infrastructure, particularly in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) and Wide Area Networks (WANs). This eliminates the need for expensive construction, as the copper wiring is already in place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The technology works by leveraging unused twisted copper pairs, known as dry copper pairs. These pairs can be connected to EoC equipment, creating a high-speed Ethernet link from a location to the nearest telephone company office, where it can then be connected to other locations, typically via fiber optic lines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ethernet services, including EoC, come in standardized options. E-Line offers a direct point-to-point connection between two Local Area Networks (LANs), while E-LAN provides a multipoint service, similar to a meshed network, connecting three or more locations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While EoC bandwidth can range from 1 Mbps to 20 Mbps or higher, it&amp;rsquo;s important to note that distance limitations exist. Lower speeds typically offer a wider range, while higher speeds restrict the distance to under a mile. This distance constraint is why EoC is often considered a metropolitan service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Compared to services like T-Carrier or SONET, Ethernet offers greater scalability. Users can initially install a higher bandwidth capacity and only pay for the service they need, with the option to easily upgrade bandwidth as requirements change.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The cost-effectiveness of EoC, often providing double the bandwidth for a similar price compared to traditional T1 lines, makes it an attractive alternative. Furthermore, higher speeds are usually available at reasonable rates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Considering these advantages, evaluating the potential benefits of increased bandwidth or improved pricing through EoC is worthwhile.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Is 5G Bandwidth Slicing The New Private Network?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-5g-bandwidth-slicing-the-new-private-network/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jun 2024 00:10:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-5g-bandwidth-slicing-the-new-private-network/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>By: John Shepler&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The internet is great for connecting, but it&amp;rsquo;s not always reliable. While it provides widespread access, low costs, and supports most applications, it can fall short when high performance and reliability are crucial. Issues like latency, packet loss, and congestion can hinder or even prevent interactive applications from working correctly. The solution? Private networks.&lt;/p>

alt="5G bandwidth slicing for private networks."
>&lt;/a>&lt;strong>What is a Private Network?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The internet is a public network, accessible to almost anyone. All you need is an account with an internet service provider. Its strength lies in its global reach, built over decades. Everyone has equal footing – average users, corporations, and even connected devices. This principle is called network neutrality. The only things you can pay extra for are a faster connection to the internet backbone and more bandwidth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While this equality is generally beneficial, it can lead to performance issues. When numerous users demand high bandwidth simultaneously, like during a live-streamed event or peak backup times, connections can suffer. This is especially problematic for applications requiring high speeds and low latency, such as video conferencing, gaming, remote surgery, financial trading, or controlling electric vehicles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Private networks offer an alternative. Unlike your company&amp;rsquo;s LAN, which is isolated and typically offers sufficient bandwidth, private networks extend this concept across cities or even countries. Instead of building it yourself, you can partner with a network provider who offers dedicated point-to-point connections. While sharing infrastructure, you receive guaranteed bandwidth and network characteristics like low latency and minimal packet loss.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Types of Private Networks&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While older technologies like T1 lines and SONET fiber were once prevalent, today, Ethernet over Fiber and MPLS networks are the most popular choices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ethernet over Fiber mirrors your LAN&amp;rsquo;s protocol, simplifying integration. It supports various configurations like point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, and mesh networks, offering speeds from 10 Mbps to 10 Gbps, with 100 Gbps becoming more common. Popular uses include connecting to cloud providers, linking business locations, and content delivery.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MPLS networks are specialized for wide-area connectivity, even internationally. Their unique protocol enhances security compared to standard IP networks. Though shared, these networks guarantee each customer their contracted bandwidth. MPLS networks with Ethernet access points offer extensive coverage at a lower cost than multiple private lines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>5G Slicing as the New Private Network&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The rise of mobile applications requires wireless connectivity. While 4G LTE and now 5G offer significant improvements, they still rely on the internet with its inherent limitations. Bandwidth constraints and congestion can impact application performance, especially in busy areas. 5G slicing addresses this by reserving a portion of bandwidth for private use, for an additional fee.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Think of it as having a dedicated lane on a congested highway. 5G slicing offers a faster path to the internet or can create a private network or connection to a private fiber network. It&amp;rsquo;s essentially your LAN without wires, accessible over a wide area.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some organizations are implementing private 5G networks on their premises for similar benefits. 5G slicing expands this concept, providing connectivity on the go, including for vehicles, smartphones, tablets, and various devices that struggle with traditional internet connections.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Issues with 5G Slicing&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As 5G slicing is still in its early stages, availability might be limited. One concern is the potential for congestion if everyone seeks a private slice of the bandwidth. While 5G offers more bandwidth, especially on higher frequencies, it&amp;rsquo;s not unlimited. This scarcity drives the push for more 5G frequencies, including some currently allocated to the military.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Network neutrality also poses a challenge. Allowing paid prioritization through 5G slicing contradicts the principle of a neutral internet. While regulators currently accept it with some conditions, the increasing privatization of wireless spectrum might face opposition.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Are you frustrated with your company&amp;rsquo;s slow internet speeds? It&amp;rsquo;s understandable. Today&amp;rsquo;s applications are much more demanding than the simple websites and text-based emails common when T1 lines were first introduced. A 10 Mbps connection is now the bare minimum for most businesses, and it&amp;rsquo;s reasonable to need 100 Mbps or even 1000 Mbps. So, how can you upgrade effectively?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.gigapackets.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;img src="http://www.gigapackets.com/images/BandwidthGrowth10M1G250.jpg"

alt="Business bandwidth for 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps and 1000 Mbps at attractive prices."
>&lt;/a>&lt;strong>Upgrading Your Connection&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One option is to gradually increase your bandwidth as your needs grow. Bonded T1 lines offer speeds from 3 to 12 Mbps in 1.5 Mbps increments. However, you must use a single provider for all lines, and equipment changes are needed with each upgrade. Still, this might be the best choice in rural areas with limited options.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another option is Ethernet over Copper (EoC), which is available in most metropolitan areas. EoC provides higher bandwidth (3 to 20 Mbps) at lower costs compared to bonded T1. However, bandwidth decreases with distance from the service provider&amp;rsquo;s office.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most promising option today is Ethernet over Fiber. While fiber optic service was once rare and expensive, newer Ethernet over Fiber solutions offer businesses several advantages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Advantages of Ethernet over Fiber&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ethernet over Fiber (EoF) utilizes the same Ethernet protocol as your company&amp;rsquo;s LAN but with enhancements for telecom carrier use. Also called Carrier Ethernet or Metro Ethernet, this metropolitan service is easy to integrate with your network. A fiber or copper Ethernet connection links to your service provider, which you plug into your edge router.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Designed for scalability, EoF makes upgrades simple, usually without equipment changes. Unlike legacy services that required lengthy carrier-led equipment swaps, EoF upgrades happen quickly, often within hours or days. Some providers even allow on-demand adjustments through a computer interface.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Bandwidth Options&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ethernet over Fiber typically starts at 10 Mbps and can reach 10 Gbps or higher. Common speeds align with standard Ethernet LAN speeds: 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, and 1000 Mbps. You can also get speeds between these benchmarks, starting at 10 Mbps and gradually increasing to 100 Mbps or more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The crucial factor is the installed port speed, which dictates the connection speed to the provider&amp;rsquo;s equipment. A 100 Mbps Fast Ethernet connection is suitable for speeds up to 100 Mbps, while a Gigabit Ethernet port is recommended for higher speeds. For anything beyond 1 Gbps, install a 10 Gbps port from the outset to avoid future equipment changes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Cost-Effectiveness&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The popularity of Ethernet over Fiber has led many traditional and new carriers to offer it, creating a competitive market that benefits buyers. EoF pricing per Mbps is significantly lower than bonded T1, DS3 (T3), or SONET services. You can potentially cut your internet costs by 50% or more while maintaining high reliability, low latency, minimal jitter, and minimal packet loss.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If this sounds like the solution for your business internet needs, explore the pricing and availability of &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.gigapackets.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>The recent tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, has left many young students grappling with trauma and fear. The horrific event, where students and educators lost their lives, has created a sense of anxiety about returning to school for the spring semester. Finding a way to comfort these children and help them cope with their fears is a significant challenge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kim Piscatelli from East Hampton, Connecticut, believes she&amp;rsquo;s found a way to provide some comfort. Inspired by the children&amp;rsquo;s book &amp;ldquo;The Kissing Hand&amp;rdquo; by Audrey Penn, Kim initiated a project to provide each child in Newtown with a copy of the book and a pair of mittens or gloves adorned with a heart on the left palm. The book tells the story of Chester Raccoon, whose mother kisses his palm to reassure him whenever he feels lonely or misses home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The project has garnered immense support, with knitting groups actively creating mittens with heart accents. The aim is to ensure that every child receives a pair of these comforting mittens along with the book as they return to school.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While the response has been positive, the need is extensive. Hundreds of students from Sandy Hook Elementary and surrounding areas have been impacted by the tragedy. To address this, individuals are encouraged to contribute by sending child-size mittens or gloves with heart embellishments to:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Kissing Hand Mitten Project
93 East High Street
East Hampton, Ct. 06424&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Gloves are readily available, and heart shapes can be easily found in fabric stores. The goal is to gather and send as many mittens and gloves as possible to provide comfort and support to the children.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Chester the Raccoon&amp;rdquo; plush dolls are also available for purchase online. These cuddly companions can offer additional comfort to the children.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, the book &amp;ldquo;The Kissing Hand&amp;rdquo; is temporarily available as a free download on iTunes, offering a digital version with text, illustrations, and narration. Physical copies are also readily available for purchase.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The hope is that this small gesture of a &amp;ldquo;kissing hand&amp;rdquo; will provide a sense of comfort and security, allowing the children to gradually return to a sense of normalcy in their lives. The project embodies a collective effort to support and uplift the community in the wake of unimaginable tragedy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>No-Till Gardening Using Minibeds-on-Plastic: The Importance of Glomalin and Mycorrhizae</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/no-till-gardening-using-minibeds-on-plastic-the-importance-of-glomalin-and-mycorrhizae/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jun 2024 19:59:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/no-till-gardening-using-minibeds-on-plastic-the-importance-of-glomalin-and-mycorrhizae/</guid><description>&lt;p>Dateline: 11 March 2017&lt;/p>

loading="lazy"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Amazing beauty, on a microscopic level&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My new Minibeds-on-Plastic experimental garden is designed as a no-till system for growing vegetables. While there will be no soil disturbance under the plastic covering most of the garden, the &amp;ldquo;island&amp;rdquo; minibeds themselves will also remain mostly undisturbed. This minimal-till approach is central to the Minibeds-on-Plastic method, and I&amp;rsquo;ll explain why.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Contrary to common belief, tilling the soil does not enhance its structure. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t improve aeration or create the porous texture crucial for a thriving garden.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I used to rototill my entire garden every spring, believing it was the correct way to prepare for planting. However, I&amp;rsquo;ve since realized that extensive tilling is detrimental to both the soil and the plants. Since I stopped this practice, my gardens have become more productive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My shift to no-till gardening stems from learning about the vital role of soil structure and, more specifically, mycorrhizal fungi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Mycorrhizal Factor&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The image at the beginning of this post displays a mycorrhizal &lt;em>arbuscle&lt;/em> within a plant root cell. This isn&amp;rsquo;t a harmful invasion but a mutually beneficial relationship crucial for gardeners to grasp. Mycorrhizal fungi offer numerous advantages to plants.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Essentially, plants provide nourishment to these fungi. Through photosynthesis, plant leaves use sunlight and carbon dioxide to produce sugars (carbohydrates). While some of these sugars fuel plant growth, a significant portion is released into the soil.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plants &amp;ldquo;leak&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;pump&amp;rdquo; a surprising amount of these sugars to support soil microbes, with mycorrhizal fungi being major beneficiaries. In the image, the arbuscle, resembling a tree, absorbs these sugars for its growth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the mycorrhizal fungi grow, they extend a vast network of thread-like hyphae far beyond the plant&amp;rsquo;s root system. These hyphae act as extensions of the roots, accessing water and nutrients that the roots cannot reach.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The famous illustrations of root systems by Professor John Weaver do not depict the vast network of mycorrhizal hyphae that likely coexist and collaborate with these roots. Imagine those root systems intertwined with an equally extensive, if not larger, network of hyphae.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj0EOyB_c0Y-jFGWv2tC5DGYCAqzuiksmR4r5Gdjm3Xg9SRLaZuit4YtmpFt747sjZkSU21TLsfC7HaQHpVbH4jM4GWHJZoZuO9jCZqyibYsSuTHv-NrcjUMc8sVaTjHVymuY-p-LwjX6Q/s1600/Sweet-Corn_Mature-Roots&amp;#43;jpg.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

loading="lazy"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plants colonized by mycorrhizal fungi exhibit increased nutrient and water uptake, resulting in visible improvements above ground.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These fungi also enhance plant resilience against diseases and, remarkably, participate in a complex underground communication network between plants and the soil ecosystem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beyond benefiting plant growth and health, mycorrhizal fungi significantly improve the soil structure surrounding them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Glomalin Factor&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mycorrhizal hyphae release a substance called glomalin as they spread through the soil. This newly discovered (1996) &amp;ldquo;biological glue&amp;rdquo; binds soil particles together, improving soil aggregation and tilth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Aggregation results in both large and small pores within the soil. Well-aggregated soil allows water to be absorbed and drained efficiently, promoting aeration and a thriving environment for beneficial soil microbes. This is clearly demonstrated in the video at the end of this post.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, common gardening practices, such as tilling, disrupt the mycorrhizal network and destroy glomalin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No-till gardening preserves glomalin, enhances soil structure, and allows plants to reap the full benefits of naturally occurring mycorrhizal fungi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>No-Till With Minibeds-on-Plastic&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mycorrhizal fungi and glomalin are most effective in the presence of living roots. In my Minibeds-on-Plastic system, a significant portion of the garden is covered with black plastic mulch. This creates a no-till environment under the plastic, but without plants or roots.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While this might seem like a drawback, I see it as a necessary trade-off. I&amp;rsquo;m accepting a reduction in the overall benefits of a fully no-till system in exchange for increased manageability and productivity within the focused area of the minibeds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Without the plastic mulch, weeds would quickly take over my garden. This has been a recurring challenge, making the garden less productive and requiring constant effort to control weeds. The Minibeds-on-Plastic system will prevent this and eliminate the need for disruptive tilling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because I won&amp;rsquo;t be digging the minibeds, the existing roots, mycorrhizal hyphae, and glomalin will remain undisturbed, allowing them to extend their benefits beyond the minibed boundaries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Furthermore, my no-till approach includes rotating root-dense cover crops, particularly rye, in the minibeds during the fall and spring. These cover crops will not be tilled in as green manure; instead, their above-ground growth will be harvested, chopped, and used as mulch or added to compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is my vision of no-till gardening within the Minibeds-on-Plastic system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dan Grubbs has raised concerns about potential heat buildup under the black plastic and its impact on beneficial soil organisms. This is a valid point, particularly in specific growing regions, as I addressed in Minibeds-on-Plastic Report #1 (see Question 15 on page 25). If this becomes an issue, I plan to add a layer of wood chips over the black plastic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Some Fungal Loose Ends&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that mycorrhizal fungi are just one type of fungi found in soil. Some break down organic matter, others are harmful, but most are beneficial.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While mycorrhizal fungi form symbiotic relationships with most plants, they do not cooperate with brassicas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These fungi are naturally present in most garden soils and will thrive under the right conditions, such as no-till practices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Commercially available mycorrhizal inoculants exist, but their efficacy is debatable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, some bacteria contribute to soil aggregation on a smaller scale by producing bio-glues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Evidence Of Good Soil Structure&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This video featuring Ray Archuleta offers a compelling look at the advantages of no-till gardening and farming. It is a must-watch!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Merchant Account Credit Card Processing Made Easy</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/merchant-account-credit-card-processing-made-easy/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jun 2024 17:42:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/merchant-account-credit-card-processing-made-easy/</guid><description>&lt;p>Even the smallest businesses need a way to process credit card payments.

To clarify, Dynamics GP software generates zero-dollar checks when an invoice is fully paid through methods like credit memos or manual payments. This often happens before a check run or when opting for automatic application of unapplied documents during check runs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These zero-dollar checks, appearing on the edit list after a check batch is created, act as placeholders, allowing for a remittance advice to be printed within the check run, confirming the invoice was settled using existing credits.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s illustrate with an example:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>An invoice for $100 is entered and posted for Vendor ABC.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A manual payment of $100 is entered, posted, and applied to the invoice for Vendor ABC.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A check batch is created.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Regular checks, along with a zero-dollar check for Vendor ABC, are selected for payment.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The appearance of a zero-dollar check often causes confusion. Remember, it serves solely as a placeholder. However, the process differs between standard Dynamics GP and when using Mekorma MICR.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In standard Dynamics GP:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>You print checks.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Only regular checks are printed; the zero-dollar check is ignored.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You proceed to post the checks.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The remittance advice for the zero-dollar check can then be printed separately.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>A key point of contention in post-Brexit EU/UK relations is the degree to which the UK remains bound to the EU Court of Justice (ECJ). This issue arises first in the withdrawal agreement being negotiated, a draft of which was recently proposed by the EU Commission. While it will eventually affect the future relationship between the two, this post focuses on the withdrawal agreement.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This analysis examines the main issues, provides commentary on the proposed withdrawal agreement, and suggests amendments. Note that some issues relate to the acquired rights of EU27 and UK citizens, which will be covered in a subsequent analysis. Previous analyses have addressed the proposed text on the transition period and the Irish border.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Structure of the withdrawal agreement&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The primary provisions regarding dispute resolution are found in the &amp;ldquo;Final Provisions&amp;rdquo; of the draft withdrawal agreement (Articles 151-168).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Part Six is divided into four titles:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>- Title I on “Consistent Interpretation and Application” (Articles 151-156) covers aspects of ECJ jurisdiction, a proposed UK authority to safeguard EU27 citizens’ rights, and other provisions;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>- Title II on “Institutional Provisions” (Articles 157-159) establishes a Joint Committee to oversee and implement the Agreement;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>- Title III on “Dispute Settlement” (Articles 160-165) includes provisions for both ECJ involvement and unilateral sanctions; and&lt;/p>
&lt;p>- Title IV on “Final Provisions” (Articles 166-168).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A complete understanding requires considering other parts of the draft agreement: the “Common Provisions” (Part One: Articles 1-7); citizens’ rights (Part Two: Articles 8-35); the “separation provisions” (Part Three: Articles 36-120); the transition period (Part Four: Articles 121-126); the financial settlement (Part Five: Articles 127-150); and the Protocols on Ireland and UK bases on Cyprus.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Broader context&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As an EU Member State, the UK is subject to the ECJ&amp;rsquo;s jurisdiction, including references from national courts on EU law interpretation or validity, direct challenges to EU institutions&amp;rsquo; actions, and infringement actions against Member States for violating EU law.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, non-EU states are rarely subject to ECJ jurisdiction. This only occurs when international treaties signed by the EU reference EU law, a necessary practice for the EU as, according to ECJ case law, interpretations of EU law by non-EU entities that bind the EU violate EU law.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Dispute settlement, ECJ and the withdrawal agreement: an overview&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Article 4(4) of the draft withdrawal agreement states that references to EU law within the agreement must be interpreted according to ECJ case law preceding the transition period&amp;rsquo;s conclusion. Article 4(5) mandates considering subsequent ECJ case law. Article 2 broadly defines EU law, and Article 5 clarifies that it includes amendments up to the transition period&amp;rsquo;s end. Articles 4(1) to (3) require the withdrawal agreement to have the same legal force and interpretation rules as during the UK&amp;rsquo;s membership, and be incorporated into UK primary legislation, ensuring EU27 citizens can directly invoke acquired rights provisions in UK courts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the transition period, the ECJ retains its standard jurisdiction over the UK (Article 126). Once the transition period ends (proposed end of 2020: Article 121), Part Three of the Withdrawal Agreement (separation provisions) outlines special rules for ECJ jurisdiction. Articles 82-87 specify continued jurisdiction for pending cases and those related to pre-transition period events. Article 91 addresses UK non-compliance with EU body administrative decisions before the transition period ends.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the proposed &amp;ldquo;fallback&amp;rdquo; rules on the Irish border are implemented, the ECJ will retain jurisdiction over the Protocol on Ireland indefinitely (Article 11 of the Protocol). Additionally, interpreting the Protocol&amp;rsquo;s EU law rules in line with ECJ case law becomes a permanent requirement (Article 12(2) of the Protocol).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Regarding the core ECJ and dispute settlement rules, Part Six grants the ECJ special jurisdiction over citizens&amp;rsquo; rights issues for eight years following the transition period, based on requests from UK courts (Article 151). The UK must establish an independent authority to help EU27 citizens enforce these rights (Article 152). The ECJ also retains jurisdiction over the separation provisions and EU law aspects of the financial settlement post-transition (Article 153).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A Joint Committee will be formed to oversee and implement the agreement (Articles 157-159), which is not inherently controversial. However, its role in settling disputes between the EU and the UK is a contentious issue. Disputes involving individuals and companies will be addressed in national courts, with potential references to the ECJ based on its proposed jurisdiction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the transition period, disputes regarding agreement interpretation will be discussed by the Joint Committee, which can refer the matter to the ECJ if both parties agree. If unresolved after three months, either party can unilaterally invoke ECJ jurisdiction (Article 162). If a ruling is allegedly not followed, the ECJ can be asked to rule on the non-compliance and potentially impose a fine (Article 163(1) and (2)). Additionally, either side may impose sanctions on the other (Article 163(3)).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, if the EU believes the UK has not complied with an ECJ ruling during the transition period, it may suspend some of the UK&amp;rsquo;s internal market benefits. The UK does not have a corresponding power.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently, the UK agrees with only some proposals, mainly those concerning citizens&amp;rsquo; rights, the transition period, and aspects of the separation provisions. The dispute settlement provisions have not been agreed upon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Are the Commission’s proposals legally and politically sound, or are the UK’s objections valid? Firstly, the provisions on EU27 citizens&amp;rsquo; rights build upon a previous agreement between the UK and the Commission, establishing special ECJ jurisdiction for eight years and a dedicated UK authority. The Commission&amp;rsquo;s proposals on the latter could be strengthened, and there is no reason to delay the authority&amp;rsquo;s creation until the transition period ends, as EU27 citizens may require assistance sooner. Amendments to Articles 152 and 168 are proposed to address these issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Secondly, the agreed-upon ECJ jurisdiction during the transition period reflects the overall agreement that EU law and institutions will continue to apply to the UK (except for UK representation within those institutions). A preferable solution would have been integrating the UK into the EFTA Court during this period, granting it a judge and potentially applying the EEA Treaty, allowing greater input into EU law while applying less of it. However, the UK government appears disinterested in this approach.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This brings us to the more controversial, unagreed-upon aspects. It is understandable that the UK seeks to limit ECJ jurisdiction post-Brexit, as it will no longer be a Member State and ECJ jurisdiction over non-EU countries is historically restricted. However, the ECJ’s own case law precedents cannot be ignored: non-EU bodies interpreting EU law in a binding manner for the EU violates EU law. The challenge for the UK, given its stance against future ECJ jurisdiction, is that the withdrawal agreement inherently references EU law. Avoiding the ECJ in the future UK/EU relationship may be less problematic, depending on the contested issue of how much EU law the UK will retain post-Brexit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Considering this, the Court&amp;rsquo;s continued jurisdiction over separation issues (detailing how EU laws cease to apply to the UK) and EU law elements of the financial settlement provisions are difficult to circumvent. Due to the ECJ’s stance, any UK-EU disputes in these areas could only be settled by the ECJ. Therefore, Article 153’s jurisdiction over these matters likely cannot be removed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, non-judicial sanctions are a separate matter. The prospect of unilateral EU sanctions against the UK for non-compliance with a judgment during the transition period is both unnecessary and unreasonable. It is unnecessary because, as per the EU&amp;rsquo;s insistence, the ECJ&amp;rsquo;s usual jurisdiction, including imposing fines for non-compliance, will be in effect. The issue of time limits is irrelevant as cases against the UK pending at the transition period&amp;rsquo;s end will not be dismissed but decided afterward. It is unreasonable because this remedy would solely apply to the UK (as if no EU27 Member State has ever violated EU law!), hypocritically treating the UK as both a Member State and non-Member State, and avoids political resolution while circumventing the burden of proof requirement for the accusing party in the ECJ. There is no explicit mention of whether the EU&amp;rsquo;s decision could be legally challenged, which would contradict the EU principle of the rule of law if not allowed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Post-transition, the situation is more complex: political dispute resolution would be attempted, followed by potential ECJ jurisdiction, then, if an ECJ ruling is allegedly disregarded, a request for the ECJ to impose sanctions. There also exists a poorly drafted, illogical provision allowing for further sanctions, which should be discarded.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The current approach is confusing, treating the UK as both a Member State (compulsory ECJ jurisdiction) and a non-Member State (sanctions). It would be more logical to acknowledge the UK&amp;rsquo;s future status as a non-Member State and focus on potential sanctions for either party upon unsuccessful dispute settlement attempts, as in the EEA treaty. Requesting an ECJ ruling could remain an option, limiting its jurisdiction to EU law interpretation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These points, along with technicalities, are detailed in the annotated Part Six text below, which also proposes amendments.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>PART SIX&lt;/p>
&lt;p>INSTITUTIONAL AND FINAL PROVISIONS&lt;/p>
&lt;p>TITLE I&lt;/p>
&lt;p>CONSISTENT INTERPRETATION AND APPLICATION&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Article 151&lt;/p>
&lt;p>References to the Court of Justice of the European Union concerning Part Two&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Where, in a case which has commenced at first instance within eight years from the end of the transition period before a court or tribunal in the United Kingdom, a question is raised concerning the interpretation of Part Two of this Agreement, and where a court or tribunal in the United Kingdom seized with that case considers that a decision on that question is necessary to enable it to give judgment in that case, it may request the Court of Justice of the European Union to give a preliminary ruling on that question. The Court of Justice of the European Union shall have jurisdiction to give preliminary rulings on such requests. The legal effects in the United Kingdom of such preliminary rulings shall be the same as the legal effects of preliminary rulings given pursuant to Article 267 TFEU in the Union and its Member States.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Background&lt;/em>: &lt;em>This reflects part of para 38 of the joint report. It sets the eight-year time limit starting from the end of the transition/implementation period, whereas that starting point was not definitively decided in the joint report, as it noted that discussions on the transition had yet to take place. It specifies that the CJEU’s powers concern the whole of Part Two, not just the vaguer “interpretation of those rights” in the joint report. As agreed, this differs from Article 267 TFEU in that final courts in the UK are not obliged as a rule to refer cases. However, the legal effects of such rulings are the same as under Article 267. That issue was not mentioned in the joint report, but the CJEU has ruled that its judgments (where its jurisdiction exists) must always be binding, even as regards non-EU states (see &lt;a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/kiran/Documents/Opinion%201/91" >Opinion 1/91&lt;/a>, para 38). It is implicit that the Court’s other jurisdiction (notably on infringement proceedings) will not apply.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>According to Article 168, this provision – and the whole of Title I of Part Six (Articles 151 to 156) will only apply from the end of the transition/implementation period. That temporal limitation appears in the text of Article 151, but not Articles 152 to 156.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Comments: It is not clear what will happen to cases pending at the end of this eight-year period. To address such issues, I have a suggested amendment, to add this sentence: After the end of this eight-year period, Articles 82(2) and (3), 83(2) and 85(1) and (2) shall apply mutatis mutandis. This would mean that the CJEU still has jurisdiction for cases pending before it and courts in the UK at the end of that date, and confirm that its judgments after that date will remain binding on the UK. This is perhaps evident anyway from the final sentence and the words “commenced at first instance within eight years” (and from “litigation brought within 8 years” in the joint report), but it is better to confirm it explicitly.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>If the transition period were extended, that would in principle have knock-on effects on this Article. It should be noted that there is no time limit on the CJEU’s jurisdiction to rule on the application of this agreement as regards UK citizens in the EU27. Nor is there any other limit on its jurisdiction relating to them (ie final courts will in principle have to send cases concerning them to the CJEU; infringement proceedings can apply).&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Article 152&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Monitoring of the implementation and application of Part Two&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The United Kingdom shall set up an independent Authority to monitor the implementation and application of Part Two. That Authority shall have the power to receive and investigate complaints from Union citizens and their family members, and to conduct inquiries on its own initiative, concerning alleged breaches by administrative authorities of the United Kingdom of their obligations under Part Two. The Authority may make its findings public. Where it considers that the administrative authority concerned has not acted appropriately on its findings, and without prejudice to any remedies available to the Union citizens or family members concerned, the Authority shall have the right to bring a legal action before a competent court or tribunal in the United Kingdom in an appropriate judicial procedure with a view to seeking adequate redress. The Authority shall inform the European Commission of any such legal actions brought before courts or tribunals in the United Kingdom. It may also consult the European Commission before bringing such legal actions and the European Commission may suggest to the Authority to bring such legal actions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Background: This is based on part of para 40 of the joint report, which provides as follows:&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>The implementation and application of the citizens&amp;rsquo; rights Part will be monitored in the Union by the Commission acting in conformity with the Union Treaties. In the UK, this role will be fulfilled by an independent national authority; its scope and functions, including its role in acting on citizens&amp;rsquo; complaints, will be discussed between the parties in the next phase of the negotiations and reflected in the Withdrawal Agreement. There should be regular exchange of information between the UK Government and the Commission.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Comments&lt;/em>: &lt;em>The “scope and functions” of this body, in the proposal, would be: a) “to receive and investigate complaints from Union citizens and their family members”; b) “to conduct inquiries on its own initiative, concerning alleged breaches” of the rules by UK “administrative authorities”; and c) to “bring a legal action before a competent court or tribunal in the United Kingdom in an appropriate judicial procedure with a view to seeking adequate redress”, if it believes that the administration does not react appropriately, “without prejudice to” remedies the EU citizens and their family members have. Implicitly it will not be able to make its own binding decisions on complaints brought to it. As for procedural rules: the authority “may make its findings public&lt;/em>”&lt;em>; it “shall inform” the Commission on legal actions and “may consult” it beforehand; the Commission may also suggest that the authority brings such actions.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>This clause raises certain questions. In light of the recent botched attempt to appoint Toby Young to a university regulator,&lt;/em> &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/27/toby-young-appointment-student-cronyism" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;em>without following a proper process&lt;/em>&lt;/a>&lt;em>, there might be some doubts about the integrity of the appointment process. The authority might lack sufficient staff and funding. At the very least, the UK should make a declaration attached to the agreement, specifying more detail on these points. Although the power for the authority to make its own decisions (which the government would have to challenge) would be useful, the proposed powers (broadly comparable to the Commission’s, although there are no details of the process as compared to Article 258-260 TFEU on infringement proceedings) are an essential minimum, and hopefully the UK government will not seek to weaken them.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>The question arises what happens if the authority gives a disappointing reply to a complaint, or fails to reply within a reasonable time. Is there a remedy against the authority in that case? Must its decisions be reasoned? The Commission may be reluctant to push this issue because there are no effective remedies against its infringement decisions following individual complaints – and it likes it that way. There are also questions of whether there will be time limits upon bringing complaints, or upon the authority bringing legal proceedings. The authority does not appear to have the power to bring proceedings as regards general changes to the law, or to comment on them. It seems to have the discretion whether to make its proceedings public. It is not clear that the authority’s power to bring proceedings can lead to a remedy for the complainant; and it would be useful if the authority could submit observations in cases which it didn’t bring itself, in accordance with with Articles 154 and 155.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Substantively, the definition of “family members” logically entails an implied cross-reference to the definition in Article 8, in light of the reference to Part Two. “Union citizens” are defined in Article 2, which applies to the entire agreement.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Note that according to Article 168, this provision will only apply from the end of the transition/implementation period. This seems highly objectionable, since the UK will be rolling out a “settled status” scheme well before that time, and EU27 nationals may need the assistance this body will offer as soon as possible after Brexit day. I have therefore suggested an amendment to Article 168. In comparison, the Commission’s powers to apply its infringement proceedings powers are unlimited in time.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>To ensure that the powers of this authority are effective, I suggest an amendment based on the powers of data protection authorities. It would apply equally to the Commission, although it might be questioned whether such extra powers alter the “essential elements” of its powers pursuant to ECJ case law. I would argue not, since the Commission’s independence from Member States remains intact.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Suggested amendment: The United Kingdom shall set up an Authority to monitor the implementation and application of Part Two. That Authority shall act with complete independence in performing its tasks and exercising its powers in accordance with this agreement. The United Kingdom shall ensure that the Authority has the human, technical and financial resources, premises and infrastructure necessary for the effective performance of its tasks and exercise of its powers.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>The Authority&lt;/em> &lt;em>shall have the power to receive and investigate complaints from Union citizens and their family members, and to conduct inquiries on its own initiative, concerning alleged breaches by administrative authorities of the United Kingdom of their obligations under Part Two. It shall inform the complainant of the progress and the outcome of the investigation within a reasonable period. [It shall have the power to order the administrative authorities to ensure compliance with this Agreement.] It shall give reasons for its decisions, which shall be subject to effective judicial review.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>The Authority shall make its findings public, with the consent of the complainant. Where it considers that the administrative authority concerned has not acted appropriately on its findings, and without prejudice to any remedies available to the Union citizens or family members concerned, the Authority shall have the right to bring a legal action before a competent court or tribunal in the United Kingdom in an appropriate judicial procedure with a view to seeking adequate redress for the benefit of the individual(s) concerned. In other pending cases, the Authority may submit written observations to the courts or the tribunals in the United Kingdom. With the permission of the court or tribunal in question, it may also make oral observations.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>The Authority shall inform the European Commission of any such legal actions brought before courts or tribunals in the United Kingdom. It may also consult the European Commission before bringing such legal actions and the European Commission may suggest to the Authority to bring such legal actions. The authority may also suggest to the Commission to commence an infringement procedure in accordance with the Treaties, and may submit observations in accordance with Article 154.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>This Article shall apply mutatis mutandis to the Commission.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Article 153&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union concerning Parts Three and Five&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Without prejudice to Article 83 of this Agreement, Articles 258, 260, and 267 TFEU shall apply in respect of the interpretation and application of Part Three of this Agreement and of applicable Union law referred to in Article 129 and Article 131(1) or (2) of this Agreement. To this effect, any reference made in Articles 258, 260, and 267 TFEU to a Member State shall be read as including the United Kingdom.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Comment: This grants the ECJ jurisdiction over infringement actions and preliminary rulings concerning the separation provisions (Part Three) and the references to EU financial law in Part Five (financial settlement), which remain applicable after the transition period if payments are made after that date.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>According to Article 168, this provision will only apply after the transition period concludes. The Court’s standard jurisdiction will remain in effect until then.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>The cross-reference to Article 83 covers cases initiated before the transition period&amp;rsquo;s end, which will remain under the ECJ&amp;rsquo;s jurisdiction for future decisions.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Article 154&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Submission of statements of case or written observations&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Where a court or tribunal of a Member State refers a question concerning the interpretation of this Agreement to the Court of Justice of the European Union for a preliminary ruling, the decision of the national court or tribunal containing that question shall be notified to the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom shall be entitled to submit statements of case or written observations to the Court of Justice of the European Union within two months of such notification.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Background: This Article partially reflects the joint report’s second sentence of para 39: “In the same vein, it is envisaged to give the UK Government and the European Commission the right to intervene in relevant cases before the CJEU and before UK courts and tribunals respectively.” This Article defines those “relevant cases”. Note that this applies to the entire withdrawal agreement, not just the citizens’ rights provisions. Article 168 states this provision will only apply after the transition/implementation period ends, but unlike Article 151, it has no set expiry date.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Comment: This right of intervention is not unusual. For instance, EFTA EEA states can (and occasionally do) present their views in CJEU cases relevant to the EEA treaty. However, this represents a very narrow interpretation of “relevant cases.” Surely, a case is relevant not only when directly concerning the withdrawal agreement but also when it involves an EU law issue potentially impacting the UK, as per Article 4(5), which requires UK authorities to consider relevant CJEU case law decided after the transition period. Additionally, allowing the Article 152 Authority to intervene in cases concerning EU27 or UK citizens seems appropriate, as the UK government might not be inclined to defend their rights.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Therefore, two amendments are proposed. Firstly, the first sentence should read: “Where a court or tribunal of a Member State refers a question concerning the interpretation of this Agreement, or a provision of Union law within the scope of Article 4(5) of this Agreement&lt;/em>…” Secondly, add a new sentence at the end: “Where the case concerns Part Two of this Agreement, this Article shall also apply mutatis mutandis to the Authority referred to in Article 152.”_&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Article 155&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Participation of the European Commission in cases pending in the United Kingdom&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Where the consistent interpretation and application of Part Two of this Agreement so requires, the European Commission may submit written observations to the courts or the tribunals in the United Kingdom in pending cases where the interpretation of the Agreement is concerned. The European Commission may, with the permission of the court or tribunal in question, also make oral observations. The European Commission shall inform the United Kingdom of its intention to submit observations before formally doing so.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Background: This Article also partially reflects the joint report&amp;rsquo;s second sentence of para 39: &amp;ldquo;In the same vein, it is envisaged to give the UK Government and the European Commission the right to intervene in relevant cases before the CJEU and before UK courts and tribunals respectively.&amp;rdquo; This article defines those “relevant cases.&amp;quot; Unlike Article 154, this article is limited to citizens’ rights provisions and does not encompass the entire withdrawal agreement. Per Article 168, this provision becomes applicable only after the transition/implementation period ends. However, unlike Article 151, it does not expire after eight years.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Comment: This explicit power to intervene in national court proceedings, while potentially novel, could be compared to the Commission’s power to submit observations in EFTA Court proceedings. It overlaps with the Authority’s power to initiate cases and, for a period, with UK courts&amp;rsquo; ability to refer questions about citizens&amp;rsquo; rights to the CJEU.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Article 156&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Regular dialogue and exchange of information&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to facilitate the consistent interpretation of this Agreement and in full deference to the independence of courts, the Court of Justice of the European Union and the United Kingdom&amp;rsquo;s highest courts shall engage in a regular dialogue, analogous to the one which the Court of Justice of the European Union pursues with the highest courts of the Member States.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Background: This Article partially reflects the Joint Report’s para 39, which states: “Consistent interpretation of the citizens&amp;rsquo; rights Part should further be supported and facilitated by an exchange of case law between the courts and regular judicial dialogue.” However, Article 156’s scope is not limited to citizens’ rights and lacks explicit mention of exchanging case law (or any other &amp;ldquo;information&amp;rdquo; referenced in the article&amp;rsquo;s title). As per Article 168, this provision applies only after the transition/implementation period ends.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Comments: The absence of provisions for exchanging information or case law is unusual, especially as the EU has incorporated such exchanges in treaties with non-EU states. Therefore, an amendment is suggested, adding a sentence at the end: “The Joint Committee shall establish a mechanism to ensure regular mutual transmission of case law and other information relevant to this Agreement.”&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>TITLE II&lt;/p>
&lt;p>INSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Article 157&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Joint Committee&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>A Joint Committee is hereby established, comprising representatives of the Union and of the United Kingdom. The Joint Committee shall be co-chaired by the Union and the United Kingdom.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The Joint Committee shall meet at least once a year or at the request of the Union or the United Kingdom. The Joint Committee shall set its meeting schedule and its agenda by mutual consent.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The Joint Committee shall be responsible for the implementation and application of this Agreement. The Union or the United Kingdom may refer to the Joint Committee any issue relating to the implementation, application and interpretation of this Agreement.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The Joint Committee shall:&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>(a) supervise and facilitate the implementation and application of this Agreement;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(b) decide on the tasks of the specialised committees and supervise their work;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(c) seek appropriate ways and methods of preventing problems that might arise in areas covered by this Agreement or of resolving disputes that may arise regarding the interpretation and application of this Agreement;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(d) adopt its own rules of procedure, as well as rules of procedure of the specialised committees;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(e) consider any matter of interest relating to an area covered by this Agreement;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(f) adopt decisions and make recommendations as set out in Article 159;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(g) adopt amendments to this Agreement in the cases provided for in this Agreement.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>5. The Joint Committee may:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(a) delegate responsibilities to the specialised committees, except those referred to in points (b), (d), (f) and (g) of paragraph 4;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(b) establish other specialised committees than those established by Article 158 in order to assist it in the performance of its tasks;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(c) change the tasks assigned to the specialised committees or dissolve any of those committees; and&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(d) take such other action in the exercise of its functions as decided by the Union and the United Kingdom.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="6">
&lt;li>The Joint Committee shall issue an annual report on the functioning of this Agreement.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Comment: The Joint Committee holds various responsibilities within the Agreement beyond citizens’ rights, primarily updating the social security annex and potentially serving as a platform for dispute resolution (see Articles 162 to 165 below). Its recommendations may also be relevant, despite the lack of explicit reference within the citizens’ rights section.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Article 158&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Specialised committees&lt;/p>
&lt;p>1. The following specialised committees are hereby established:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(a) the Committee on citizens&amp;rsquo; rights;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(b) the Committee on the other separation provisions;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(c) the Committee on issues related to the island of Ireland;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(d) the Committee on Sovereign Base Areas related issues;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(e) the Committee on the financial provisions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2. Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, or unless the co-chairs decide otherwise, the specialised committees shall meet at least once a year. Additional meetings may be held at the request of the Union, the United Kingdom, or of the Joint Committee. They shall be co-chaired by representatives of the Union and of the United Kingdom. The specialised committees shall set their meeting schedule and agenda by mutual consent. The specialised committees may draw up draft decisions and recommendations and refer them for adoption by the Joint Committee.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>3. The Union and the United Kingdom shall ensure that their respective representatives on the specialised committees have the appropriate expertise with respect to the issues under discussion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>4. The specialised committees shall inform the Joint Committee of their meeting schedules and agenda sufficiently in advance of their meetings and shall report to the Joint Committee on results and conclusions from each of their meetings. The creation or existence of a specialised committee shall not prevent the Union or the United Kingdom from bringing any matter directly to the Joint Committee.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Comment: Note the inclusion of a specialized committee dedicated to citizens&amp;rsquo; rights, which is likely to remain active for a considerable time due to the extended timeframe for applying Part Two of the Agreement.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Article 159&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Decisions and recommendations&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The Joint Committee shall, for the purposes of this Agreement, have the power to adopt decisions in respect of all matters for which this Agreement so provides and make appropriate recommendations to the Union and the United Kingdom.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The decisions adopted by the Joint Committee shall be binding on the Union and the United Kingdom, and the Union and the United Kingdom shall implement them. They shall have the same legal effect as this Agreement.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The Joint Committee shall adopt its decisions and make its recommendations by mutual consent.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Comment: The Joint Committee&amp;rsquo;s primary decision-making power regarding citizens&amp;rsquo; rights is adopting new social security regulations under Article 31. Its dispute settlement powers (discussed below) and recommendations may also be relevant, despite the lack of specific reference in the citizens&amp;rsquo; rights section.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>TITLE III&lt;/p>
&lt;p>DISPUTE SETTLEMENT&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Article 160&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cooperation&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Union and the United Kingdom shall, at all times, endeavor to agree on the interpretation and application of this Agreement, and shall make every attempt through cooperation and consultations to arrive at a mutually satisfactory resolution of any matter that might affect its operation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Comment: This &amp;ldquo;best endeavors&amp;rdquo; article encourages seeking political solutions to disputes. While lacking specific legal obligations, it could prove relevant in practice, as disputes under EU free trade agreements are often resolved diplomatically.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Article 161&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Exclusivity&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For any dispute between the Union and the United Kingdom arising under this Agreement, the Union and the United Kingdom shall only have recourse to the procedures provided for in this Agreement.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Comment: This restricts the use of alternative dispute settlement methods beyond those defined in the Agreement, unless the Agreement itself is modified.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Article 162&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Settlement of disputes&lt;/p>
&lt;p>1. Without prejudice to Article 153, the Union or the United Kingdom may bring any dispute which concerns the interpretation or application of this Agreement before the Joint Committee.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2. The Joint Committee may settle the dispute through a recommendation. It shall be provided with all information which might be of use in making possible an in-depth examination of the situation, with a view to finding an acceptable solution. To this end, the Joint Committee shall examine all possibilities to maintain the good functioning of the Agreement.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>3. The Joint Committee may, at any point, decide to submit the dispute brought before it to the Court of Justice of the European Union for a ruling. The Court of Justice of the European Union shall have jurisdiction over such cases and its rulings shall be binding on the Union and the United Kingdom.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>4. If the dispute has not been settled within three months after it was brought before the Joint Committee and has not been submitted to the Court of Justice of the European Union by the Joint Committee pursuant to paragraph 3, the dispute may be submitted to the Court of Justice of the European Union for a ruling at the request of either the Union or the United Kingdom. The Court of Justice of the European Union shall have jurisdiction over such cases and its rulings shall be binding on the Union and the United Kingdom.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Comments: Article 168 dictates that this provision will only take effect after the transition period. The dispute settlement clause applies to the entire Agreement, not just citizens&amp;rsquo; rights, and is adapted from Article 111 of the EEA treaty. While para 1 is practically identical (barring party names), and para 2 is similar with the added &amp;ldquo;through a recommendation,&amp;rdquo; paras 3 and 4 differ significantly. Under the EEA Treaty, the EEA Joint Committee can, by mutual agreement and after three months, request the CJEU’s opinion on treaty rules identical to EU law. If unresolved or referred to the CJEU after six months, either party can implement safeguard measures or disapply parts of EEA rules due to divergence. The binding nature of CJEU rulings is explicitly stated, although this reiterates Opinion 1/91. The EU institution responsible for initiating proceedings needs clarification.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>This Withdrawal Agreement version relies more heavily on the CJEU: allowing earlier referral with mutual consent; permitting unilateral referral after three months; granting jurisdiction over the entire agreement (not just EU law aspects, though much references EU law); and removing resolution via safeguard or divergence decisions, although Article 165 allows for sanctions from the EU side only during the transition period, and a poorly drafted sanctions clause exists in Article 163(3). This provision overlaps with the Court&amp;rsquo;s eight-year jurisdiction over citizens&amp;rsquo; rights post-transition. The CJEU’s jurisdiction here would be subject to the rules of procedure outlined in an Annex (Article 164).&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>_This proposal is problematic for its one-sidedness, diverging from the EEA model, which the EU deemed legally and politically acceptable. This different approach to a similar issue could be perceived as &amp;ldquo;cherry-picking.&amp;rdquo; While establishing a system where entities other than the CJEU hold final say on EU law interpretation would violate EU law (see Opinion 1/92), the EEA system was deemed compatible as it ultimately allows for a form of sanction by&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>100 Mbps Internet for Business</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/100-mbps-internet-for-business/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jun 2024 13:13:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/100-mbps-internet-for-business/</guid><description>&lt;p>For many mid-size businesses, DS3 internet with its 45 Mbps speed has been the standard. It&amp;rsquo;s widely available and offered a significant upgrade from older T1 lines. However, with the rise of video conferencing and cloud-based applications, even DS3 struggles to handle the demands of multiple users. It&amp;rsquo;s time to consider upgrading to 100 Mbps internet access.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.fibernetworkquotes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;img src="http://FiberNetworkQuotes.com/images/100MbpsBandwidth250.gif"
loading="lazy"
alt="Check prices for 100 Mbps bandwidth options&amp;hellip;"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The 100 Mbps service level is significant because it aligns with &amp;ldquo;Fast&amp;rdquo; Ethernet, a standard Ethernet LAN speed. Most network interface cards (NICs) in computers, routers, switches, and printers support 10/100 Mbps Ethernet speeds. Newer NICs even support Gigabit Ethernet (GigE) with 10/100/1000 Mbps ports.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The issue is that connecting to the internet at a slower speed than your 100 Mbps LAN will cause a bottleneck for internet traffic. While this might not be noticeable during low network activity, congestion becomes apparent with multiple users and heavy data usage. The connection to the internet, often the WAN or wide area network, becomes the chokepoint.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fortunately, 100 Mbps business internet service is now more accessible and affordable than ever. Let&amp;rsquo;s explore the various technical approaches and their pros and cons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>OC-3, a traditional 100 Mbps telecom service, operates at around 155 Mbps. Offered by telecom companies nationwide, OC-3 is a fiber optic SONET service. It can transport various data types, including phone calls, private connections, and dedicated internet access. OC-3 is also used to deliver lower-speed services like DS3. While you might not associate DS3 with fiber optics due to its coaxial cable connections, it&amp;rsquo;s often delivered through add/drop multiplexers connected to SONET fiber cables.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>OC-3 is a well-established and popular digital line service with an SLA (Service Level Agreement), ensuring reliability. Your bandwidth is both dedicated and symmetrical. Dedicated bandwidth means you don&amp;rsquo;t share the 155 Mbps with other users, ensuring consistent availability. Symmetrical bandwidth means you have 155 Mbps for both uploads and downloads.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Carrier Ethernet directly competes with OC-3 in bandwidth. Connecting to your LAN with Fast Ethernet at 100 Mbps is straightforward using a standard RJ-45 patch cable, eliminating the need for specialized fiber optic cables or interface cards required for OC-3. Like OC-3, 100 Mbps Fast Ethernet is symmetrical, dedicated, and comes with an SLA.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fast Ethernet is available over both fiber optic and twisted-pair connections. However, Ethernet over Copper at this speed has distance limitations, making it more common in metropolitan areas. Slower speeds like 10 or 20 Mbps have a wider range and are more accessible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ethernet over Fiber, similar to OC-3, offers two key advantages. Firstly, the cost per Mbps is often lower than OC-3. Secondly, Carrier Ethernet services are scalable. While upgrading from OC-3 typically means moving to OC-12 at 622 Mbps, Carrier Ethernet offers more flexibility. With a Gigabit Ethernet port, you can easily upgrade to 200, 500, or even 1,000 Mbps as your needs grow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another increasingly available option is 100 Mbps Cable business broadband. This shared, asymmetrical service, similar to residential cable internet, typically lacks service level agreements. While it offers download speeds up to 100 Mbps, upload speeds are around 10 Mbps. This bandwidth is shared with other users, resulting in varying speeds, especially during peak hours. However, its affordability, often comparable to a T1 line, makes it suitable for businesses with limited budgets and basic internet needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re considering new business internet service or upgrading from bonded T1 or DS3 to 100 Mbps or higher, now is the time to explore your options. Check &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.fibernetworkquotes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

If your company requires communication between multiple locations within a city, a metro network might be beneficial.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Metro Ethernet is the modern solution for data connections in major cities and surrounding areas. There are two main types: E-Line and E-LAN. E-Line provides a direct Ethernet connection between two points, such as a business and its data center, warehouse, factory, or branch office.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>E-LAN, on the other hand, facilitates multi-point connections, resembling a LAN spread across a city, often called a Wide Area Network (WAN). This allows for connecting a main office to multiple branches, retail locations, warehouses, factories, or other sites within the metropolitan area. Both E-Line and E-LAN effectively unite local networks into a larger company network.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A high-quality MAN is characterized by speed, reliability, and affordability. While bandwidth is variable, Ethernet MANs typically offer standard Ethernet LAN speeds of 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, and 1000 Mbps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fiber optic lines are commonly employed in MANs for their speed, capacity, and reliability. Gigabit Ethernet speeds require a fiber optic connection to your building. Business locations in major metropolitan areas, where metro networks are prevalent, often have existing fiber optic infrastructure or are near a carrier point of presence (POP). This is particularly common in large office buildings with multiple tenants and colocation facilities hosting server farms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Carriers often extend fiber optic connections to buildings with sufficient bandwidth demand. In areas where this is impractical or financially unfeasible, Ethernet MAN connections can utilize Ethernet over Copper (EoC) technology. This system uses existing telephone wiring to provide Ethernet speeds between 1 and 100 Mbps, depending on the distance from the carrier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A key advantage is the competitive landscape driving down the cost of MAN connections significantly lower than traditional telephone company offerings. Ethernet MAN services might be surprisingly affordable. To explore available options and pricing for your business, you can use services like GeoQuote Ethernet Service Locator.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hosted Exchange Email Service Advantages</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/hosted-exchange-email-service-advantages/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jun 2024 15:58:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/hosted-exchange-email-service-advantages/</guid><description>&lt;p>POP3 email, while widely used by both businesses and individuals, has limitations that might make you reconsider your email service. While convenient, its client-server model, where emails are downloaded to your device, poses risks such as data loss and limited accessibility.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What exactly is POP3? It stands for Post Office Protocol, an internet standard for retrieving emails from a server to a client, like Microsoft Outlook or Mac Mail, installed on your computer. This setup allows offline access to downloaded emails but limits access from other devices and risks losing all your emails if your device fails.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While POP3 has its advantages, such as offline email access, it has some downsides. If your computer crashes, you risk losing all your emails. Additionally, managing emails across multiple devices becomes difficult, and you&amp;rsquo;re more vulnerable to spam and viruses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While large companies use Microsoft Exchange on their own servers for enhanced security and features, smaller companies find it challenging to manage. Hosted Exchange offers a solution by providing the benefits of Microsoft Exchange without needing to manage your own server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hosted Exchange, managed by a hosting provider, offers several advantages. These include automatic backups, access from any device, easier email recovery, and secure communication with SSL encryption.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re considering a more modern and robust email system, Hosted Exchange might be the right choice. It scales to your needs, eliminates the hassle of managing your own server, and can be more cost-effective.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Finally, a Directive safeguarding platform work - What's next?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/finally-a-directive-safeguarding-platform-work-what-s-next/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jun 2024 12:57:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/finally-a-directive-safeguarding-platform-work-what-s-next/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhcqHD7KwnkkoxRmxkmDUZngSABokD7ns5qHVoNtO8gx9u2Z8DZMHzWDOiUzS-2sY2BmrALpeB3VSfxvtSzzX4xKydbjxrdcOpL9rAGxW_kZcxLZz5wOKruz0f-jwwVbuCnZQ1qAAx7NJ0feydwCGYZxt7KfYYzQyrooI1oIR4NmDMCbdwM35twKlzGdv0/s799/uber%20eats.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>On April 24th, the European Parliament officially approved the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/gig-gling-at-last-eu-adopts-gig-work-directive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>directive designed to protect platform workers&lt;/a>. Although formal endorsement from the Council is still pending, this is largely a formality. The directive&amp;rsquo;s passage, despite the challenges and last-minute negotiations, signifies a victory. Initially, the Council presented resistance, making its unexpected adoption of the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2024/03/11/platform-workers-council-confirms-agreement-on-new-rules-to-improve-their-working-conditions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>compromise agreement&lt;/a> on March 11th surprising. This followed &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/02/16/eu-deal-on-platform-workers-falls-apart-again" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>prior rejections&lt;/a> of the same text. The shift in support came from Greece and Estonia, who moved from abstention to voting in favor, thus dissolving the blocking minority. Germany, however, maintained its abstention due to internal disagreements, while France, a major critic of the directive, seemed to soften its stance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This Council approval marks a significant stride toward enhancing platform workers&amp;rsquo; rights in labor law and social security. It also underscores the EU&amp;rsquo;s social agenda, building upon the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/european-council/2017/11/17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>2017 Gothenburg summit&lt;/a> and the introduction of the &lt;a class="link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1606&amp;amp;langId=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>European Pillar of Social Rights&lt;/a>. The Commission has, once again, delivered. However, compromises reached during negotiations resulted in the weakening of several provisions compared to the initial proposal. This is particularly true for provisions related to the rebuttable presumption of an employment relationship. More crucially, the compromise excluded many of the European Parliament&amp;rsquo;s suggestions aimed at bolstering platform worker protections found in its common position.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Weakened Presumption of Employment&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The final proposal is significantly &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=a0f26907-3c45-47df-9460-861642076bdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>diluted&lt;/a>, especially concerning its key provision: establishing a presumption of employment for individuals working on platforms like Deliveroo, Uber, and Bolt. Allowing Member States to determine the criteria for applying this presumption undermines efforts to create a level playing field for states, markets, businesses, and providers. This &amp;ldquo;loose&amp;rdquo; presumption could potentially create more challenges than solutions. Moreover, Member States are explicitly &lt;em>not&lt;/em> mandated to apply this presumption within the domains of &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.socialeurope.eu/platform-work-directive-the-clock-is-ticking" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>social security and tax law&lt;/a>, possibly &lt;a class="link" href="https://verfassungsblog.de/a-hidden-battlefield/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>EUR 3.98 billion&lt;/a>. Despite Member States&amp;rsquo; inability to agree on a directive mandating a &lt;a class="link" href="https://verfassungsblog.de/a-hidden-battlefield/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>spillover effect&lt;/a> impacting other national legal areas, individual states retain the freedom to implement such measures. This is likely influenced by the sensitive issue of the EU&amp;rsquo;s jurisdiction. However, even a diluted version compels EU states to incorporate this presumption, which could be challenged in national courts and eventually reach the European Court of Justice (ECJ). It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that EU law safeguards and ECJ case law limit national discretion. Critically, the directive emphasizes that this presumption must be based on factual indicators of control and subordination, not on alleged agreements between parties. Member States have flexibility in interpreting these criteria within the evolving digital labor market. The directive mandates that states establish procedures to uphold this legal presumption of employment. This positions the directive as more procedural than substantive. Once again, Member States have the autonomy to design these procedures, provided they ensure it is &amp;ldquo;effectively easy&amp;rdquo; for platform workers to benefit from this presumption (recital 32). A concern is that this could trigger more legal disputes regarding employment status, shifting the focus from the status itself to the presumption. Notably, the presumption doesn&amp;rsquo;t automatically reclassify workers as employees. Only time will reveal the presumption&amp;rsquo;s efficacy and the countries where it&amp;rsquo;s most impactful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Remaining Provisions&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Conversely, the comprehensive chapter on algorithm management could offer genuine &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.socialeurope.eu/algorithmic-management-a-codetermination-challenge" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>European Parliament&lt;/a>, which depends on self-regulation, this directive imposes concrete obligations and restrictions on platforms. The directive is ambitious and, notably, applies many of its provisions to self-employed individuals, taking a holistic approach. The Commission&amp;rsquo;s draft remained largely unchanged until January, when a few modifications were introduced. This directive expands upon the &lt;a class="link" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>GDPR&lt;/a> by prohibiting the processing of specific personal data and the use of biometric data for predicting future behavior, aligning with fundamental rights concerns such as potential pregnancy discrimination. It surpasses the GDPR by compelling platforms to provide transparency into their design and functionality. Similarly, human oversight is mandated not only for platform-made decisions but also for data monitoring, for instance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Moreover, the directive brings about improvements in platform transparency and accountability. The agreed-upon version requires platforms to provide reports and disclose information to pertinent authorities. This includes declaring platform work engagement and the number of individuals regularly engaged in such work. The objective is twofold: to gather data and to monitor platforms, ultimately aiming to enhance the enforcement of applicable rules in both domestic and cross-border scenarios.

&lt;p>This utility is designed for Dynamics GP users who utilize Project Accounting Timesheets to track salaried employees&amp;rsquo; time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Salaried employees receive fixed payroll costs. However, when their worked hours fluctuate from the standard hours within a pay period, the general ledger project timesheet costs don&amp;rsquo;t align with their actual payroll expenses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Companies approach this discrepancy in various ways: some disregard it, others make manual adjustments to align timesheet costs with payroll amounts, and some post summary adjustments to rectify the difference. However, none of these methods are ideal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The PA Timesheet Recalc utility addresses this by modifying unit costs on PA timesheets to ensure they correspond with the employee&amp;rsquo;s payroll. It accomplishes this by averaging the unit cost based on timesheet hours, managing rounding discrepancies from the average cost calculation, and recalculating timesheet distributions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The original version of this utility was developed for companies where employees submitted a single timesheet per pay period. In this scenario, the total timesheet cost would consistently match the employee&amp;rsquo;s pay and any associated overhead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, in some organizations, employees submit multiple timesheets within a pay period. This is common when different managers, responsible for different projects, need to approve timesheets, leading to employees submitting separate timesheets daily for each project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To accommodate this, Version 2.0 of the PA Timesheet Recalc utility can now recalculate multiple timesheets for an employee over any given date range. For example, if an employee submits 20 timesheets between January 16th and January 30th, the utility analyzes all timesheets to determine the correct average cost and recalculates them. The user can define the date range and choose multiple employees to include in this process.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>While the PA Timesheet Recalc utility caters to a specific need, it can significantly reduce the time spent reconciling project costs with payroll expenses for companies using Project Accounting Timesheets.&lt;/p>

People ask about managing revenue recognition, only to discover that many handle it by simply recognizing revenue alongside expenses and fees. This leads to the assumption that revenue recognition isn&amp;rsquo;t necessary, overlooking the need for accruals at the end of each month for unbilled amounts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sometimes, the conversation shifts to using the revenue recognition module for accruals. This method proves to be complex and inefficient, especially since GP&amp;rsquo;s revenue recognition typically functions in one of three ways: based on project progress (measured by cost or hours), upon project completion, or over time for service fees.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What many miss is that GP Project Accounting has built-in functionality for accruing unbilled revenue and its corresponding unbilled accounts receivable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This involves using a Time and Materials Project with the &amp;ldquo;When Performed&amp;rdquo; accounting method. This method generates a credit to Unbilled Project Revenue and a debit to Unbilled Accounts Receivable when a project cost is posted. The amounts in these accounts are determined by the budgeted profit type and the project amount/percentage. Upon billing the expenses, the amounts shift from unbilled to actual revenue and accounts receivable. This way, the unbilled accounts receivable and unbilled revenue represent your accrual at any given time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While this works well for expenses, accounting for fees and their accrual requires a different approach. Instead of using a fee, a zero-cost miscellaneous log is used. This involves setting up a miscellaneous log cost category with no cost, a quantity matching the total fee (if known), a billing rate profit type, and a billing rate of $1. This allows you to enter a zero-cost miscellaneous log at month-end, with the quantity reflecting the fee amount you want to accrue. The system then calculates the accrued revenue and accrued accounts receivable for the general ledger posting. This method is especially useful when the fee accrual isn&amp;rsquo;t predetermined but is determined by external factors like project milestones.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The advantage of managing fees as zero-cost miscellaneous logs is that they enter the Work in Progress (WIP) queue for billing at the desired amount.&lt;/p>

The most fundamental of these is IaaS, which forms the basis for the other two. IaaS essentially refers to providing basic hardware and operating system software over the internet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.cloudnetworkingservices.com/cloud-computing-providers.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;img src="http://www.cloudnetworkingservices.com/images/CloudIaaS.jpg"
loading="lazy"
alt="Cloud computing providers offer infrastructure on demand. "
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Infrastructure is fairly self-explanatory: it&amp;rsquo;s the foundational hardware and software needed for computing. When considering cloud infrastructure, the comparison is often made with having your own data center. So why would a business choose to move to the cloud?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are compelling business reasons to use IaaS. Traditional infrastructure is expensive to purchase and maintain, demanding constant upkeep and becoming obsolete quickly. Physical infrastructure is also sensitive, requiring controlled environments, security measures, and significant power resources.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another consideration is determining how much infrastructure to acquire. You need enough to handle regular operations, but what about unforeseen spikes in demand? Products can suddenly become popular, or online content can go viral, leading to unexpected surges in traffic. Social media platforms are well-acquainted with this phenomenon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cloud service providers present a solution to the limitations of on-premise data centers, frequently with significant cost advantages. Their business model is based on scale. They build large data centers filled with virtualized and dedicated servers, storage systems, security tools, and diverse network connections. All of this is housed in highly secure facilities with redundant power systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This might sound like a colocation center, and there are similarities. However, a key difference is elasticity. Elasticity refers to the ability of resources to scale up or down as needed. With colocation services, you typically have a fixed contract, and while you can adjust it, changes take time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cloud services operate on a utility computing model, similar to electricity. You don&amp;rsquo;t request more power from the utility company; you simply use what you need. Only when you exceed your capacity do you need to adjust your service level.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>IaaS is priced based on usage. Cloud providers possess vast resources, and their economies of scale allow them to serve numerous clients, each unaware of the others. Your services are isolated, ensuring that no other user can impact your resources or operations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The benefit for businesses is clear: IaaS provides the necessary resources, when needed, at a cost that reflects actual consumption rather than idle capacity. This eliminates the need for large capital investments and reduces staffing requirements, as the provider manages operations and maintenance constantly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To determine if your business could benefit from cloud services, it&amp;rsquo;s worthwhile to &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.cloudnetworkingservices.com/cloud-computing-providers.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>compare pricing and services from different cloud providers&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A simple Dynamics GP customer query unexpectedly returned zero results, even though the customer existed in the system. Upon closer inspection, it was discovered that the customer ID had a leading space.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While Dynamics GP prevents users from entering leading spaces directly, eConnect allows them during import. This discrepancy can cause issues when querying data, as SQL differentiates between values with and without leading spaces.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This highlights the importance of trimming leading and trailing white space from data during integration. Even though Dynamics GP doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow leading spaces, eConnect&amp;rsquo;s acceptance of them can lead to data inconsistencies and unexpected behavior.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The author emphasizes that trimming white space is crucial for data integrity and consistency, regardless of the system&amp;rsquo;s built-in restrictions. This seemingly minor detail can have a significant impact on data retrieval and integration processes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Key takeaways:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Leading spaces in data can cause problems in various systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Dynamics GP and eConnect handle leading spaces differently, potentially causing discrepancies.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Trimming leading and trailing white space is essential for all imported data to avoid unforeseen issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

However, they can also be used for Voice over IP (VoIP) communication between company locations or to connect with the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) through gateways.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Traditional T1 lines were designed to carry 24 simultaneous high-quality phone calls over a copper wire pair. Each call is digitized and placed into one of 24 eight-bit time slots, synchronized precisely using atomic clocks. Devices called channel banks handle the multiplexing and demultiplexing, essentially creating 24 distinct phone lines at each end. T1 PRI lines function similarly but dedicate one channel for signaling and data like Caller ID.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>T1 and T1 PRI lines remain viable choices for businesses with traditional PBX phone systems. The interface remains consistent, and costs have significantly decreased. Most PBX and larger Key systems offer compatible interface boards.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>VoIP differs from traditional circuit-switched telephony. Although voice is still converted from analog to digital, potentially using the same CODEC (Coder/Decoder), it&amp;rsquo;s handled differently. Instead of rigid time slots, digital voice samples are packaged into packets. These packets, adhering to the Internet Protocol (IP), coexist with data packets on the network. Transmission speed depends on network capacity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For VoIP, the full 1.5 Mbps capacity of a T1 line is utilized as a Wide Area Network (WAN), referred to as &amp;ldquo;unchannelized.&amp;rdquo; Imagine it as a large data pipeline connecting two points. Both ends could be company locations, or one could connect to the internet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A key difference between TDM-based T1 and VoIP is bandwidth management. In VoIP, your network, through routers or an IP PBX, prioritizes voice packets over less time-sensitive data to ensure call quality. Adequate bandwidth for peak voice traffic is crucial. As your needs grow, additional T1 lines can be combined to increase bandwidth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since both voice and data use the IP format, unchannelized T1 lines can carry both simultaneously. This enables &amp;ldquo;integrated T1 line service,&amp;rdquo; providing phone and internet over a single line. An IAD converts phone calls to VoIP, combines voice and data packets, then separates them at the destination, sending voice to the phone network and data to the internet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Businesses using VoIP can leverage T1 lines for voice and data between offices. IP PBXs or IP Phones convert calls to data packets, eliminating the need for a separate IAD. However, a voice gateway might be necessary for calls outside the organization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that WAN connections are now available using Ethernet. By choosing Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, or Gigabit Ethernet WAN, businesses can establish efficient network connections regardless of distance.&lt;/p>

It achieves this by encapsulating these protocols within its own tunnels upon entering the network and restoring them to their original format upon exit. Within the MPLS network, routing occurs based on simplified tags inserted into packet headers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Constructing this specialized network for transporting other network traffic offers the advantage of defining service classes. This ensures that real-time data, such as voice and video, receive the necessary bandwidth and low latency for optimal performance. The multi-protocol nature of this network is particularly appealing to carriers tasked with transporting diverse data types. Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS), a set of extensions, further enhances the versatility of this already adaptable network.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While MPLS focuses on controlling packet flow in packet-switched networks, GMPLS acknowledges the existence of other network types with elements not necessarily packet-oriented. For example, Time Division Multiplexing (TDM), the traditional digital telephony standard and foundation of Synchronous Optical Network (SONET), relies on time slots rather than packets. Although packets can be transmitted over TDM networks, large packets are divided into multiple time slots and reassembled later. This process negates the inherent advantages of predictable time slots in TDM, as they become irrelevant in the packet-switched world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>GMPLS reintroduces the significance of TDM. A time slot can function as a label, eliminating the need for additional labels since the network inherently understands the data carried within each time slot. Similarly, a wavelength or Lambda can serve as a label in a Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) network. Even an entire fiber can be treated as a GMPLS label to define a network path.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Assigning labels to all network elements involved in data packet routing decisions grants the GMPLS network a high degree of autonomy. It receives data from various protocols at the ingress point and adds its own labels. These labels can be MPLS &amp;ldquo;shim&amp;rdquo; type inserted into packet headers or &amp;ldquo;implicit&amp;rdquo; type associated with specific fibers, wavelengths, or TDM time slots. Label routing switches then route the GMPLS data over predetermined paths established at the ingress point. Upon reaching the network edge (egress point), all labeling information is removed, allowing the different data types to proceed in their native protocols.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Significantly, there is no mention of manual intervention for circuit provisioning or route setup. GMPLS networks inherently recognize available network resources and automatically establish and dismantle label-switched paths as required. The widespread deployment of GMPLS networks is anticipated to significantly simplify and expedite the labor-intensive task of service provisioning through automation.&lt;/p>

Election laws typically set the stage but don&amp;rsquo;t directly determine the winner, although there are notable exceptions like the 2000 US election.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The 2014 Commission President election is unique because the rules changed, and their interpretation is debated. Previously, the European Council appointed the President after European Parliament approval. The Treaty of Lisbon introduced new rules, applied for the first time, stating the Parliament &amp;ldquo;elects&amp;rdquo; the President based on the Council&amp;rsquo;s nomination, &amp;ldquo;taking account&amp;rdquo; of Parliament election results.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Seemingly, not much has changed, as the European Council has operated since 1999 assuming the Commission President aligns politically with the Parliament&amp;rsquo;s largest party. However, most European political parties believe the Treaty amendments mean they should nominate their President before elections, and the party with the most seats should see their candidate win.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This belief stems from the rule change and the fundamental idea that linking Parliament elections to the Commission President selection enhances the EU&amp;rsquo;s democratic legitimacy. Voters would choose the EU executive like national parliamentary elections determine executives in parliamentary systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, this interpretation is disputed. The ECR party (AECR during elections), including British Conservatives, won&amp;rsquo;t name a candidate, rejecting the link between Parliament elections and Commission President selection, instead running national campaigns. The EFD party, including the UK Independence Party, will also not name a candidate. Angela Merkel doesn&amp;rsquo;t accept an automatic link between EP elections and the President nomination. The UK Labour party, while agreeing with parties nominating candidates, doesn&amp;rsquo;t support the Party of European Socialists&amp;rsquo; nominee.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ECR party believes letting Parliament elections decide the Commission President lacks democratic legitimacy, citing no public demand and asserting national governments should primarily legitimize EU policies. A critique by Heather Grabbe and Stephan Lehne for the Centre for European Reform also raises several objections.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Post-election Possibilities&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Predicting political outcomes is risky, but it&amp;rsquo;s necessary here because a &amp;ldquo;partisan&amp;rdquo; Commission President&amp;rsquo;s merit depends on assumptions about the next appointment. The Grabbe/Lehne paper presents three scenarios: (a) the EP prevails, and the Council proposes the largest party&amp;rsquo;s candidate without objection; (b) deadlock between Parliament and Council over the appointment; and (c) a behind-the-scenes deal is made. Writing in October 2013, (c) seemed likely; now, the European People&amp;rsquo;s Party is less likely to win the most seats and will nominate a candidate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A messy deadlock is still possible. Due to proportional representation voting mandated by EU Treaties, no single party will hold a majority after May&amp;rsquo;s Parliament elections. To reject the Council&amp;rsquo;s nominee, the winning party needs support from others. They&amp;rsquo;ll also need support to elect their President, assuming the Council even proposes them. If not, deadlock looms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the Parliament has always sought a larger role in Commission appointments, holding hearings for nominees even before their influence grew. When the last two Commissions were appointed, the Parliament rejected individual nominees despite no Treaty provision allowing it. Therefore, if necessary, a majority might veto any President candidate not nominated by the largest party, and the Council would likely acknowledge this reality. Effectively, the Council would become like a constitutional monarch, similar to Queen Elizabeth II, in appointing the Commission President.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Is Choosing the Commission President Through European Parliament Elections a Good Idea?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just because it seems increasingly likely doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it&amp;rsquo;s beneficial. Let&amp;rsquo;s examine arguments from Grabbe/Lehne about its potential impact on the Commission&amp;rsquo;s effectiveness. Firstly, they argue that a &amp;ldquo;partisan&amp;rdquo; President couldn&amp;rsquo;t perform effectively due to the Commission&amp;rsquo;s objective tasks, including economic governance, state aids, competition, human rights, and infringement actions. Secondly, a President elected via EP elections might not be a strong leader, hindering collaboration with national governments. Thirdly, beholden to the EP, the President&amp;rsquo;s initiatives could be blocked by the Council, creating legislative gridlock similar to the US system. Fourthly, with Member States choosing other Commissioners, a President from one party might face a majority of Commissioners from opposing backgrounds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second set of arguments concerns the concept&amp;rsquo;s legitimacy and democratic credentials. Grabbe/Lehne&amp;rsquo;s argument overlaps with the ECR&amp;rsquo;s stance. Both argue that the EP is detached from constituents and that strengthening the link to the Commission President selection won&amp;rsquo;t change this due to the candidates&amp;rsquo; lack of recognition.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are generally valid arguments, so let&amp;rsquo;s analyze them individually. First, many of the Commission&amp;rsquo;s technical tasks have been delegated to EU agencies, leaving legislation proposal as its primary function. Clearly, political choices influence proposed legislation and its implementation. State aid and competition decisions, bound by objective rules, can be challenged in court, and the Commission&amp;rsquo;s infringement actions must be argued there. If the President were &amp;ldquo;partisan,&amp;rdquo; establishing mechanisms to separate less political decision-making from political choices would be wise, but not impossible, as seen in the European Central Bank&amp;rsquo;s separation of banking supervision (politically accountable) from its independent central bank role. Regardless, Grabbe/Lehne&amp;rsquo;s argument ignores that since 1999, the President has been chosen from the party with the most EP seats without demonstrably impacting the Commission&amp;rsquo;s technical work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Second, while the next President likely won&amp;rsquo;t be a former Prime Minister (unlike the last three), this doesn&amp;rsquo;t guarantee effectiveness: the most effective Presidents (Hallstein and Delors) were not Prime Ministers, while the least effective (Santer) was. This argument assumes neither Member States nor the President will work effectively with the other, which seems unlikely given the EU&amp;rsquo;s history of seeking consensus among institutions. Similarly, regarding the third argument, any President understands their initiatives require at least a qualified majority in the Council.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The fourth argument (the Commission&amp;rsquo;s partisan mix) is perhaps the most compelling. To make a comparison, it&amp;rsquo;s difficult for British Conservatives to accept governing with a minority of Liberal Democrats in the cabinet. How could a government function with David Cameron as Prime Minister and a Labour party majority in the cabinet?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The answer lies in the EU institutions&amp;rsquo; pursuit of internal consensus. The diverse political makeup of Member State governments means Commissioners have always come from various backgrounds. Additionally, Grabbe/Lehne overlooks Treaty provisions strengthening the President&amp;rsquo;s influence: requiring Commissioners to work under their guidance and allowing the President to dismiss individual Commissioners. The added legitimacy of indirectly electing the President would only amplify this. As previously mentioned, the President will need multi-party support for election anyway. A more radical solution would be for the EP to expect parties to nominate a full Commission team. This has yet to occur.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Concerning political legitimacy, the ECR&amp;rsquo;s poll justifying their decision not to run a candidate was revealing. While many voters criticized the EU&amp;rsquo;s legitimacy and didn&amp;rsquo;t know the President candidates, more respondents liked the idea of EP election results determining the President, believing it would make the EU more democratic. This was particularly true in Poland, where 50% supported the idea and only 19% opposed it. Support was also found in France, Italy, and Spain, but opposed in Germany and the UK, explaining the Conservative (and perhaps Labour) positions. Despite this, the poll indicates that many who find the EU lacking legitimacy would appreciate increased legitimacy through indirectly electing the President. After all, how many people knew Barroso in February 2004, or Obama in January 2008?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ultimately, the need to forge a stronger democratic link between EU citizens and the Union is the decisive argument for indirect elections. While the concept has flaws, the existing EU system can adapt, as explained above. Those flaws are outweighed by the opportunity to democratize the EU and give voters a chance, however indirect, to (in Weiler&amp;rsquo;s words) &amp;ldquo;throw the rascals out.&amp;rdquo; This doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessitate a more centralized EU. The debate on the EU&amp;rsquo;s future would have benefited from, for example, John Major presenting the ECR&amp;rsquo;s case for a less centralized, less regulated EU focused on free trade.&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s your lifeline to customers. If they can&amp;rsquo;t easily recall your number, they might dial a competitor&amp;rsquo;s instead. This is where vanity numbers come into play.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What exactly are vanity numbers? They are standard phone numbers designed for easy memorization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are two main categories of vanity numbers. The first type spells a word or phrase, similar to personalized license plates. Creativity knows no bounds here!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But how can you spell with numbers? The answer lies in the dial pad. Every modern phone features a 12-button dial pad, also known as a touchpad or touch-tone pad. These buttons replaced the rotary dial. Those familiar with rotary phones know that each finger hole had letters and numbers. For instance, the number 2 corresponded to A, B, and C. Early phone numbers even used letters to represent exchanges, like AD for Adams, for simpler memorization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Similarly, modern dial pads retain letter-number assignments. Number 2 corresponds to A, B, and C, 3 to D, E, and F, and so on. Only the number 1 stands alone. The remaining buttons, * and #, serve special functions unrelated to phone numbers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, compare remembering 1-877-327-4325 to 1-877-3-BRIDAL. For a bridal shop, the latter is more memorable and relevant. Other examples include 1-866-89-BIBLE, 1-866-6-BEEPER, and 1-866-684-DEAL— all real, available numbers. While these specific numbers might be taken, countless others await. &lt;a class="link" href="https://fusion.kallback.com/kall8/index.cfm?agentID=apl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Discover affordable toll-free options here.&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second type of vanity number relies on numerical patterns for easy recall. Consider 1-866-262-1500, memorable for its double zero ending. Or 1-800-301-1010 with its repeating pattern. These are also real, currently available numbers. Naturally, such unique patterns are limited and pricier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Toll-free numbers, especially vanity numbers, are invaluable for small businesses. They incentivize customers to choose you over competitors. Local calls are cost-effective, but long distance charges can deter potential clients. Toll-free numbers eliminate this barrier, crucial for mail-order businesses, consultants, travel agents, and even bridal shops, directly impacting sales.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The good news is that vanity numbers remain affordable, except for those rare premium numbers. &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.agile800.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Agile800.com&lt;/a> offers vanity numbers ready for immediate use at a nominal fee of $15-$20. Examples include 1-877-7-ALUMNI, 1-866-84-BOATS, and 1-866-329-DEBT, among many others. Remember, availability changes rapidly, so act fast!&lt;/p>

While you could once manage a website with just a computer and a few phone lines, today&amp;rsquo;s high-definition video and nationwide audiences demand far more resources. This is where content delivery networks (CDNs) come in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Think of a CDN as a specialized web hosting service. Just as you can host your website on your own server or outsource it, you can also choose between managing your content distribution or relying on a CDN. CDNs handle the technical aspects, like server upkeep, power, and high-speed internet connections, so you can focus on creating content.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Opting for a CDN offers similar advantages to using a hosting service: it&amp;rsquo;s often simpler, more cost-effective, and more scalable. CDNs have their own networks designed for storing and delivering content to many users across a large area. They guarantee sufficient bandwidth for your needs, whether it&amp;rsquo;s software, music, or high-definition video. Some CDNs even have partnerships with internet service providers (ISPs) to bypass the public internet entirely, resulting in faster content delivery.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>CDNs use different methods to optimize their services. Some store multiple copies of your content on servers across the country, directing your download request to the closest available copy. Others distribute content across their network for efficient delivery. Load balancing among servers enhances reliability by automatically switching to a working server if one fails.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Speaking of bandwidth, if you&amp;rsquo;re finding your current capacity insufficient, it might be time to explore better WAN bandwidth options.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ethernet Connects Businesses Throughout Latin America</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-connects-businesses-throughout-latin-america/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2024 06:05:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-connects-businesses-throughout-latin-america/</guid><description>&lt;p>In recent years, numerous businesses have opted for Carrier Ethernet services for various connectivity needs, including Dedicated Internet Access (DIA), point-to-point private lines, last-mile access to MPLS networks, and meshed connections linking multiple business locations within the United States. This capability is now expanding globally. For instance, Level 3, a prominent international carrier, received recognition from the Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF) for its services in the Caribbean and Latin America.&lt;/p>

alt="Check prices and features of Ethernet services to Latin America or other worldwide destinations now&amp;hellip;"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While international voice and data services have been around for a long time, facilitated by extensive undersea fiber optic cables connecting continents, the recent shift lies in protocol changes and the emergence of new services for global companies and organizations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ethernet&amp;rsquo;s displacement of older protocols stems from the dominance of IP packets in electronic communication. Most Local Area Networks (LANs) are Ethernet-based, and the internet, the largest interconnected network, relies on routing IP packets. This begs the question: why not extend existing networks using the Ethernet protocol?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The primary obstacle to a faster transition to IP-based core networks is legacy infrastructure. The substantial investments in infrastructure over the past century, primarily built by telephone companies using Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) standards like T1, DS3, and SONET, won&amp;rsquo;t disappear overnight.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fortunately, existing telecom equipment doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to be replaced to implement Ethernet services. Carrier Ethernet functions over IP and TDM networks. Ethernet over T1 (EoDS1) serves as an effective last-mile connection for MPLS networks or point-to-point private lines, leveraging the extensive reach of T1 infrastructure, particularly in rural areas. Ethernet over DS3 (EoDS3) offers higher bandwidth at 45 Mbps, while Ethernet over SONET starts at 155 Mbps and scales to at least 10 Gbps, with some connections reaching 40 Gbps and 100 Gbps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The presence of the Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF), an industry standards group, has accelerated Carrier Ethernet adoption. The MEF establishes and maintains standards for manufacturers and Ethernet service providers, such as the E-NNI (Ethernet Network to Network Interface), which enables predictable and carrier-agnostic traffic exchange between networks. This allows carriers to expand their reach through peering arrangements via E-NNIs, accessing markets they don&amp;rsquo;t directly serve without laying fiber globally.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Level 3&amp;rsquo;s award-winning project involved providing Ethernet-based connectivity solutions for a major banking and financial services company throughout Brazil. An increasing number of large and medium-sized businesses are considering Ethernet services for interconnecting their locations worldwide. Smaller companies are also recognizing the cost benefits and seamless connectivity of Ethernet, making it a compelling choice when renewing contracts or setting up new installations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If your organization, regardless of size, seeks improved connectivity at lower costs compared to traditional telecom services, explore the pricing and features of Carrier Ethernet services.&lt;/p>

>Wikicommons Media&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Internet of Things (IoT), encompassing devices with integrated hardware and software like smartwatches and WiFi security cameras, is becoming increasingly prevalent in homes and industries. However, the cybersecurity of these connected devices is a growing concern. Hackers have exploited vulnerabilities in these devices, as demonstrated by the Mirai botnet attack, where thousands of devices were compromised to disrupt websites and businesses. Similarly, the Target supermarket hack, where attackers gained access to cash registers through their network-connected air-conditioning systems, highlights the vulnerability of always-connected devices. With billions of IoT devices in use, the potential for cyberattacks is vast, making enhanced cybersecurity crucial. While existing legislation like product safety law inadequately addressed this issue, a new legislative proposal aims to bridge this legal gap.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On September 15, 2022, the European Commission proposed the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) to safeguard the European Union market from insecure products. Article 1 of the Act outlines four key areas:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Regulations for introducing digitally-enabled products to the EU market, ensuring cybersecurity.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Essential requirements for the design, development, and production of products with digital components.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Manufacturer requirements for vulnerability management to guarantee cybersecurity throughout the lifecycle of digital products.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Market surveillance and enforcement.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This blog post provides a concise overview of the new regulations concerning the cybersecurity of products with digital elements, specifically points 1-3. It first examines the framework of the Act, focusing on its scope and cybersecurity provisions. Subsequently, it explores how the Act integrates into and modifies the existing regulatory framework for the cybersecurity of products with digital elements, particularly IoT devices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Products with digital elements&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Cyber Resilience Act will apply to &amp;ldquo;products with digital elements,&amp;rdquo; which, according to Article 3(1), encompass software, hardware, and remote data processing solutions. Therefore, the Act covers not only software applications but also specific hardware items not traditionally considered digital, such as routers and microcontrollers. A connected security camera exemplifies a product with digital elements, integrating a traditional camera system (hardware) with software that enables remote access to the camera.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While the European Commission primarily emphasizes IoT devices as the Act&amp;rsquo;s central focus, they are not the sole products within its scope. The Commission incorporates two additional categories of products with digital elements based on their &amp;ldquo;criticality.&amp;rdquo; Annex III lists all &amp;ldquo;critical products with digital elements,&amp;rdquo; primarily encompassing products with privileged network or security access, such as password managers, identity management software, and network monitoring systems. These critical systems, as per Article 3(3), pose a cybersecurity risk and must adhere to more stringent cybersecurity requirements discussed later. Furthermore, an additional category encompasses &amp;ldquo;highly critical products with digital elements&amp;rdquo; that present even greater cybersecurity risks, such as network management software utilized by energy providers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to Articles 6(2) and 6(5), the Commission can modify the list of critical and highly critical products based on their cybersecurity risks. Criteria for evaluating these risks include whether the products possess privileged access, control data access, or perform crucial trust-based functions within networks or security systems. The Commission employs supplementary criteria for highly critical products, including their utilization within critical sectors. (For cybersecurity requirements of devices employed in these sectors, refer to the NIS2 proposal: Proposal for a Directive for a high common level of cybersecurity, which is nearing adoption).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Cybersecurity requirements&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Cyber Resilience Act establishes baseline cybersecurity requirements for all products with digital elements, allowing only compliant products to enter the European market, similar to previous IoT-related product regulations like the Radio Equipment Directive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Annex I Section 1 lists these cybersecurity requirements, which are contingent on the devices being appropriately installed, maintained, used, and updated, as per Article 5(1). However, the provision does not explicitly state who bears the responsibility for ensuring these preconditions. While proper use likely falls under the user&amp;rsquo;s purview, and proper maintenance is the manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s responsibility, the accountability could shift between them depending on the action. Article 10(10) suggests that manufacturers must document the conditions under which users can ensure proper installation, operation, and use. Broadly, these conditions could imply that the user, as part of proper installation, should change the default password before using the device.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition to cybersecurity requirements, manufacturers must comply with specific vulnerability handling requirements outlined in Annex I Section 2. These requirements address the issue of numerous devices not receiving adequate updates throughout their lifespan. Without sufficient updates, these devices become security risks, as manufacturers fail to address the latest security vulnerabilities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Manufacturers are now obligated to provide regular security updates for their products, addressing any vulnerabilities throughout the product&amp;rsquo;s expected lifespan or for a minimum of five years, according to Article 10(6). Furthermore, vulnerability handling processes must ensure transparency regarding vulnerabilities discovered and patched by manufacturers. This aims to address two issues: the lack of security updates for neglected devices (e.g., due to newer models being released) and the lack of transparency regarding vulnerabilities identified by manufacturers or third parties. This lack of transparency can endanger devices from other manufacturers using similar protocols or components.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Cyber Resilience Act, through its cybersecurity requirements and vulnerability handling processes, addresses a wide spectrum of cybersecurity-related concerns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Economic operators&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Cyber Resilience Act implements product requirements to protect the European Union market. Therefore, most rules apply to manufacturers introducing devices to the EU market. Additionally, the rules extend to other actors, including importers and distributors, who place a product with digital elements on the market under their name or trademark or substantially modify an existing product already on the market (Article 15). The same substantial modification condition applies to any individual or legal entity (Article 16). The Act&amp;rsquo;s scope is broad: any entity introducing or modifying a product to the extent that it qualifies as &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; falls under its purview.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Cyber Resilience Act primarily targets manufacturers, with Article 10 outlining their key obligations, many of which also apply to importers and distributors. Manufacturers must prioritize security-by-design (Article 10(2)), conducting a risk assessment for their device and implementing its findings throughout the entire production process, from planning to delivery and maintenance. They must include specific information, including the risk assessment, in the technical documentation (Article 10(3)). The technical documentation rules are part of a set of obligations for manufacturers to provide clear and understandable information to users regarding various aspects of the device (Article 10(10)).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, Article 10(14) mandates manufacturers to notify market surveillance authorities and users when they cease operations. This obligation aims to address the issue of manufacturers neglecting existing devices in the market due to bankruptcy, acquisition, or other reasons, leaving consumers with unsupported devices that no longer receive updates or become inoperable. This new obligation promotes a more secure end-of-service process for existing devices on the market.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>A new approach&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Cyber Resilience Act will establish the most crucial cybersecurity requirements for IoT devices. Existing legislation applies to IoT cybersecurity but only through specific criteria.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Radio Equipment Directive (RED), a product safety legislation, closely resembles the Act. It establishes requirements for radio equipment before entering the EU market, similar to the Cyber Resilience Act, where economic operators must comply with specific requirements before placing their products on the EU market.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, concerning cybersecurity requirements, the Radio Equipment Directive is far more limited than the Cyber Resilience Act. Article 3(3) of the Directive outlines two primary cybersecurity requirements: 1) radio equipment must not &amp;ldquo;harm the network or its functioning nor misuse network resources&amp;rdquo; (3(3)(d)); and 2) radio equipment must incorporate safeguards to protect users&amp;rsquo; personal data and privacy (3(3)(e)). These cybersecurity requirements also extend to IoT devices, according to a recent Commission Delegated Act. These general cybersecurity requirements are less comprehensive than those listed in the Cyber Resilience Act, which crucially includes requirements for vulnerability handling processes. Recital 15 of the Act acknowledges these differences: &amp;ldquo;The essential requirements laid down by [the Cyber Resilience Act] include all elements of the essential requirements referred to in [the Radio Equipment Directive].&amp;rdquo; Consequently, the Cyber Resilience Act will supersede the Radio Equipment Directive in establishing cybersecurity requirements for IoT devices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Radio Equipment Directive&amp;rsquo;s product safety provisions are quite similar, including rules on technical documentation. However, the Cyber Resilience Act imposes broader cybersecurity-focused obligations on manufacturers, such as notifying market surveillance authorities when ceasing operations. Although the Directive might initially appear partially redundant due to its similarities with the Act, their approaches differ. The Radio Equipment Directive focuses on ensuring the overall safety of radio equipment placed on the EU market, which differs from cybersecurity requirements. For instance, the Radio Equipment Directive mandates that devices ensure access to emergency services, accommodate users with disabilities, and function with commonly used chargers. In contrast, the Cyber Resilience Act exclusively focuses on the cybersecurity of devices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Furthermore, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), another relevant legislation in the context of IoT cybersecurity, differs from the Cyber Resilience Act in its foundation. The GDPR governs personal data processing, which only partially overlaps with the Act&amp;rsquo;s security requirements. The GDPR fundamentally aims to protect individuals against the misuse of their personal data. Consequently, the Cyber Resilience Act, like the Radio Equipment Directive, supports the GDPR&amp;rsquo;s objective through its cybersecurity requirements. Recital 17 of the Act states that &amp;ldquo;the essential cybersecurity requirements laid down in this Regulation are also to contribute to enhancing the protection of personal data and privacy of individuals.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Cyber Resilience Act will provide a comprehensive framework for cybersecurity requirements, complementing existing legislation such as the Radio Equipment Directive and the General Data Protection Regulation. By doing so, the Act consolidates the growing number of cybersecurity requirements for IoT devices currently dispersed across various legislative instruments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Conclusion&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Cyber Resilience Act presents a more comprehensive set of cybersecurity requirements for IoT devices compared to existing legislation. Moreover, its provisions address longstanding concerns regarding IoT security, such as the procedures when manufacturers cease operations or when new vulnerabilities necessitate manufacturer updates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Concerning existing legislation, the Cyber Resilience Act will provide a consolidated overview of cybersecurity requirements. Previously, cybersecurity-related legislation often contained open norms and addressed specific operations (e.g., personal data processing in the GDPR). The Cyber Resilience Act will support the objectives of this related legislation while establishing the primary set of cybersecurity requirements that modern software and hardware must meet.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why PRI Over T1?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/why-pri-over-t1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2024 01:54:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/why-pri-over-t1/</guid><description>&lt;p>PRI, or Primary Rate Interface, is a popular digital telephone service used by call centers, PBX systems, and internet providers. It&amp;rsquo;s part of the ISDN standards.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>PRI is often referred to as T1 PRI in regions like the USA, Canada, and Japan because it utilizes a T1 carrier trunk. However, there&amp;rsquo;s also a service simply called T1, making PRI appear as a variation of T1.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Traditional T1, known as channelized T1, carries 24 digitized conversations simultaneously using 24 channels of 8 bits each. To manage call signaling, one bit from each channel is repurposed, leaving 7 bits for the conversation. This method is called robbed bit signaling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>PRI offers an alternative T1 format. It provides 23 channels for calls and reserves the 24th channel solely for signaling. This grants each voice channel the full 8 bits for communication. Referred to as out-of-band signaling, this separate data channel offers more advanced features compared to robbed bit signaling, such as Caller ID and faster call setup and teardown, which are crucial for call centers and ISPs. PRI channels offer flexibility by configuring for inbound, outbound, or two-way communication.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When deciding between channelized T1 and PRI, consider your needs and equipment. If features like caller information for CTI, billing, or Caller ID display are crucial, then PRI is preferable. If these features aren&amp;rsquo;t essential and having all 24 channels for calls is more important, or your PBX system lacks PRI support, then channelized T1 is a suitable option.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Steve Peers&lt;/p>
&lt;p>John Grisham&amp;rsquo;s novels often feature a recurring theme: a determined but outmatched lawyer battling a powerful corporation that exploits the legal system, a vulnerable client harmed by the corporation, a polished corporate law firm doing the company&amp;rsquo;s bidding, and an eccentric judge striving for courtroom order. This formula has been a mainstay of his books for over two decades. However, the settings rarely venture beyond the Southern United States, except for occasional plot-driven trips to Caribbean islands. The question arises: could these narratives be successfully transplanted to a European setting?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While Grisham&amp;rsquo;s novel &amp;ldquo;Playing for Pizza&amp;rdquo; does take place in Europe, it centers on an American football player navigating Italy. Instead of fictional exploration, we have a real-life case mirroring Grisham&amp;rsquo;s themes: the case of &amp;ldquo;Chain.&amp;rdquo; Documented by Irish journalists Liam O&amp;rsquo;Brien and Frank Shouldice, this case involves a vulnerable client, corporate manipulation, and legal complexities, but with unexpected turns worthy of Grisham&amp;rsquo;s writing. (It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that some aspects of the case, as reported, are disputed.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The story revolves around Mr. Bogdan Chain, the vulnerable client. In 2009, he began working for Atlanco Ltd, a Cypriot subsidiary of the Irish recruitment firm Atlanco Rimec, representing the powerful corporation. His work took him to various EU countries and Norway, which, while not in the EU, adheres to EU free movement laws. Working across borders within the EU often leads to social security complications, and while EU legislation exists to address this, it didn&amp;rsquo;t function as intended in Mr. Chain&amp;rsquo;s case.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>His problems commenced when the Norwegian government pursued him for unpaid social security contributions, even though these were supposedly deducted from his wages. His situation worsened when he suffered a heart attack, rendering him unable to work. He sought disability benefits from the Polish government, believing he qualified based on his contributions. However, both the Norwegian and Polish authorities claimed insufficient contributions, denying him benefits.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While Mr. Chain asserts he never pursued legal action, a lawsuit was filed against Atlanco Ltd in his name without his consent or knowledge. It&amp;rsquo;s debatable whether this phantom lawsuit would have benefited him if successful, but initiating legal proceedings without the plaintiff&amp;rsquo;s knowledge is ethically problematic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &amp;ldquo;Chain&amp;rdquo; case, focusing on his time in Romania, was first heard in Cypriot courts before being referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). The press coverage suggests that this case was indirectly linked to another pending case in Cyprus, where Atlanco sued the Cypriot government to allow them to pay social insurance for their staff in Cyprus instead of other EU countries. This preference for Cyprus stems from lower rates, but it can negatively impact social security systems in other member states and potentially leave employees, like Mr. Chain, liable for contributions they believed they had made and deprived of crucial benefits.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead of a plucky lawyer championing Mr. Chain&amp;rsquo;s cause, reports allege that the same law firm, representing the corporate parent, was involved with both sides of the &amp;ldquo;Chain v Atlanco&amp;rdquo; case (a claim the law firm denies). However, dedicated journalists O&amp;rsquo;Brien and Shouldice, while investigating the case, stumbled upon the real Mr. Chain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This encounter was Mr. Chain&amp;rsquo;s first awareness of the legal proceedings conducted in his name. He informed the CJEU of his lack of consent, yet the court proceeded with a hearing and even obtained an Advocate-General&amp;rsquo;s opinion. In the meantime, alerted by Mr. Chain, the Cypriot authorities ensured the case&amp;rsquo;s withdrawal in Cyprus, leading to its withdrawal from the CJEU as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mirroring the ambiguity of recent Grisham novels, this case remains unresolved. The Atlanco group has reportedly gone bankrupt, the Irish founder of the parent company is seemingly prospering, and the Cypriot government has initiated a criminal investigation. Meanwhile, Mr. Chain remains without disability benefits, and the Belgian authorities haven&amp;rsquo;t, to our knowledge, sought clarification from the implicated law firm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The journalists deserve commendation for their investigative work, which brought this questionable case to light before the CJEU issued a judgment. The crucial question is how the case progressed so far.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The focus here is on the Court of Justice&amp;rsquo;s role and whether its actions were appropriate. The Court hasn&amp;rsquo;t, as of yet, released a formal statement, and their silence on the matter is concerning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s unrealistic to expect the Court to systematically verify the legitimacy of parties in every case referred by national courts. They lack the resources for this, and any attempt to do so would fundamentally change the preliminary ruling system, which is primarily a national procedure temporarily involving the CJEU for EU law matters. Ensuring the genuineness of proceedings is primarily the responsibility of the national courts. In this instance, a lapse allowed the case to proceed in Cyprus, but this was rectified once the alleged impersonation surfaced.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The journalists have stated that neither the CJEU nor the national court was aware of the documents suggesting connections between the opposing parties until the recent criminal proceedings began, absolving them of blame in that regard. However, the question remains whether the Court should have halted proceedings upon Mr. Chain&amp;rsquo;s notification that he hadn&amp;rsquo;t authorized the case.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The answer is likely no, for two reasons. First, given the nature of the proceedings, it&amp;rsquo;s the national court&amp;rsquo;s responsibility to determine a case&amp;rsquo;s admissibility. Mr. Chain&amp;rsquo;s claim pointed to a flaw in the national proceedings, and the CJEU rightfully directed him to file a complaint at the national level, a suggestion confirmed by the journalists.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Second, immediately dismissing the case based solely on Mr. Chain&amp;rsquo;s letter creates a different impersonation risk. Consider the ongoing &amp;ldquo;Philip Morris&amp;rdquo; case before the CJEU, where the tobacco company challenges EU legislation on cigarette packaging. It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be difficult to impersonate Philip Morris&amp;rsquo;s legal representation and send a fabricated letter to the Court claiming withdrawal from the case. Therefore, the Court&amp;rsquo;s decision to await the national court&amp;rsquo;s response, rather than immediately dismissing the case, is understandable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, while the CJEU wasn&amp;rsquo;t obligated to instantly withdraw the case, it could have taken additional steps besides referring Mr. Chain to the national court. Specifically, they could have informed the parties&amp;rsquo; representatives of the allegations and requested their responses. This might have prompted withdrawal by one or both parties, revealing the case&amp;rsquo;s lack of merit. Additionally, the CJEU should have alerted the national court of the allegations, as they were better positioned to investigate. As far as we know, this didn&amp;rsquo;t happen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead, the CJEU proceeded with a potentially fabricated case, which is embarrassing, wasteful, and potentially casts doubt on the Court&amp;rsquo;s integrity. To address this, the Court should issue a public apology and implement the reforms suggested earlier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While not directly complicit in this questionable litigation, the Court&amp;rsquo;s complacency is evident. EU citizens rightfully expect better.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Lecture at Waseda University Tokyo, 14 March 2016&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

>&lt;br>
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s an honor to be presenting at Waseda University in Tokyo. Thank you to Professor Koji Tonami and Professor Kaoru Obata for making this lecture possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am consistently impressed by the comprehensive understanding of fundamental rights protection within Japan&amp;rsquo;s legal system. It&amp;rsquo;s a multifaceted landscape where citizens and legal professionals work with various binding legal texts, including domestic law, national constitutions, the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and its protocols, and EU law, particularly the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How can we best describe this complexity? German Federal Constitutional Court President Andreas Voßkuhle likened it to a mobile, with interconnected parts moving in balance. Another comparison is counterpoint music, where independent melodies harmonize. A hierarchical structure is not an accurate representation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This diverse system provides unique opportunities for growth and synergy. It encourages competition between jurisdictions, leading to more robust protection for individuals. However, the overlap between instruments can cause tension between their interpreters. A shared set of values and principles is essential for different approaches to enrich one another.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As reflected in Japanese legal culture, the ultimate goal should be harmony and mutual advancement. Prince Shotoku’s (Shôtoku Taïshi - 聖徳太子) Seventeen-Article Constitution (Jushichijo Kenpo - 憲法十七条) from 604 AD states that “&lt;em>harmony should be valued and quarrels should be avoided.&lt;/em>”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In practice, there is a high degree of consensus and active dialogue between European and national constitutional and supreme courts. A notable example is the simultaneous recognition of adoption rights for same-sex couples by the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) and the German Federal Constitutional Court. While their reasoning differed, both acknowledged the right of same-sex couples to adopt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today, I will focus on the roles of the ECtHR and the CJEU, exploring their interactions and the implications of EU accession to the ECHR.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.blogger.com/null" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;br>
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ECHR is an international treaty designed to safeguard fundamental rights, not a legal order like the European Union. Created to prevent a repeat of World War II atrocities, it now serves a broader purpose: to establish common European human rights law standards while respecting the diverse legal systems of its member states.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The success of the ECHR depends on the ECtHR&amp;rsquo;s ability to set minimum standards that all parties uphold. The ECtHR interprets broad Convention provisions and provides guidelines for their application.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Highly qualified judges are crucial for the ECtHR&amp;rsquo;s legitimacy and the consistent development of case law. These judges must possess extensive experience to gain the respect of their peers in national courts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Significant improvements have been made to the judge selection process, including the establishment of an Advisory Panel of Experts. Despite these efforts, concerns remain about finding candidates who meet the high standards and undergo the rigorous selection process, which culminates in a political decision.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A key challenge for the ECtHR is setting these standards while respecting the diverse national and supranational rights provisions. The Court has been urged to exercise restraint and prioritize cases with significant human rights implications, leaving less impactful issues to national courts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The upcoming Protocol no. 15 emphasizes the subsidiarity principle and margin of appreciation doctrine. This recognizes that states have primary responsibility for upholding rights, but are subject to the ECtHR&amp;rsquo;s oversight.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While the ECtHR&amp;rsquo;s role is to uphold a common standard, national authorities and courts are best positioned to implement the Convention locally. This necessitates a degree of deference from the ECtHR towards national legal interpretations, while still ensuring that those interpretations align with the Convention&amp;rsquo;s core principles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By focusing on significant human rights cases and respecting national interpretations, the ECtHR can effectively safeguard a unified human rights framework.&lt;/p>

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>The CJEU, while not explicitly a human rights court, has expanded its purview beyond economic matters to encompass human rights enforcement. The Court has established a significant body of fundamental rights case law, especially regarding data protection. Recent judgments, like those on data retention, search engines, and safe harbor, demonstrate that the CJEU takes fundamental rights and proportionality seriously. These rulings have also influenced the ECtHR&amp;rsquo;s stance on privacy protection, leading to stricter controls on mass surveillance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While the CJEU often draws from ECHR case law, it increasingly emphasizes the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights as the primary source for human rights protection within the EU&amp;rsquo;s legal system. This approach risks isolating the CJEU from the cooperative dialogue among European and national courts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The CJEU&amp;rsquo;s focus on the EU Charter, combined with its assertion of EU law primacy over national law, including constitutions, is facing growing resistance. National courts, including those in Germany and the UK, emphasize the importance of respecting national constitutional identity when facing conflicting EU law.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This resistance isn&amp;rsquo;t about nationalism, but rather about upholding national constitutional rights in areas where EU influence is expanding, such as asylum, data protection, and counter-terrorism. The CJEU&amp;rsquo;s approach risks creating two differing sets of rights standards within Europe, leading to legal uncertainty.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Early efforts to incorporate the EU Charter into treaties and facilitate the EU&amp;rsquo;s accession to the ECHR intended to prevent this duality. However, the CJEU&amp;rsquo;s Opinion 2/13, deeming the proposed accession agreement incompatible with EU law, has stalled this process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How can Europe advocate for human rights globally if it struggles to harmonize its own systems?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="eu-accession-to-the-echr--squaring-the-circlehttpswwwbloggercomnull">&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.blogger.com/null" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>EU accession to the ECHR – squaring the circle?&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>The CJEU&amp;rsquo;s Opinion 2/13, which deemed the EU&amp;rsquo;s accession agreement to the ECHR incompatible with EU law, has created significant obstacles. While some required amendments are technical, others, like the need to harmonize the EU Charter with the ECHR, raise fundamental issues. Despite support for EU accession to the ECHR, the path forward remains unclear.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The CJEU&amp;rsquo;s critique of the accession agreement as improvised and unprecedented is surprising. The agreement was meticulously crafted by experts from 47 states and the European Commission. The solutions reached were carefully balanced compromises, acknowledging the EU&amp;rsquo;s unique nature while preserving the ECHR&amp;rsquo;s core principles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The CJEU, however, prioritizes the &amp;lsquo;unity, primacy, and effectiveness&amp;rsquo; of EU law, as seen in its &lt;em>Melloni&lt;/em> judgment, over the constitutional commitment to accession outlined in Article 6 (2) TEU. The Court&amp;rsquo;s insistence on limiting the application of Article 53 ECHR, which permits higher national protection standards, raises questions about its interpretation of EU law and member state powers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The concept of &amp;lsquo;higher&amp;rsquo; or &amp;rsquo;lower&amp;rsquo; levels of rights protection is itself debatable. Quantifying levels of protection within broadly-worded rights catalogs is difficult. Competing human rights interests, such as freedom of expression versus privacy, require careful balancing rather than a race to the top. A more practical approach, like the &amp;lsquo;practical reconciliation&amp;rsquo; concept, seeks to find equilibrium between conflicting rights on a case-by-case basis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A primary goal of EU accession is to ensure uniform human rights protection for individuals under both EU law and member state laws. The CJEU&amp;rsquo;s objection to the ECtHR&amp;rsquo;s involvement in justice and home affairs (JHA) is problematic, citing concerns about mutual trust and EU law autonomy. However, this argument overlooks the reality of human rights violations within EU member states and the role of fundamental rights in ensuring freedom, security, and justice within the EU.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recent judgments, including the &lt;em>N.S.&lt;/em> case and the EAW case, demonstrate that fundamental rights considerations are already relevant in JHA matters, regardless of accession. These cases highlight the need to balance mutual trust with individual rights protection. Excluding the ECtHR from JHA issues would be a significant setback in a critical area for human rights protection.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusionhttpswwwbloggercomnull">&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.blogger.com/null" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Conclusion&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>The purpose of fundamental rights is to empower individuals and protect their liberties, not to enforce uniformity. Europe&amp;rsquo;s multi-level rights protection system is designed to be complementary, not segregated by origin. Uniformity is neither achievable nor desirable in a Europe comprised of diverse states.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead, a consensus on fundamental rights, applicable to all, is crucial. This requires respect, trust, and cooperation between different actors in the system. Judicial dialogue, transparency, and the recognition of shared minimum standards are essential for achieving a balanced and effective system of human rights protection in Europe.&lt;/p>

Due to limitations with Report Writer, VBA and RetrieveGlobals9.dll were used to modify the report.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following a recent update (GP 9 2010 YE Payroll Update - KB2435598, version 9.00.0386), the client reported issues with the report printing incorrectly, with edges being cut off. The problem persisted across different workstations and printers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Testing revealed that the issue occurred when printing directly to a printer, but not when printing to screen first. Further investigation pointed to the issue being related to the use of RetrieveGlobals9 within the VBA code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The root cause appears to be a bug introduced by the 2010 Year End update that affects report sections containing VBA code referencing RetrieveGlobals 9.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The issue is acknowledged in Microsoft KB Article 884601, which offers two workarounds: switching to a text-based report format (not ideal) or restructuring the VBA code to modify the scope of RetrieveGlobals and ADO objects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Initial tests with the code restructuring workaround show promise, though it may not be universally effective for all reports. The workaround involves:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Moving RetrieveGlobals and ADO variable declarations to the General Declarations section&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Instantiating RetrieveGlobals and ADO objects only in the Report Start event&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Utilizing the shared objects and variables within the report section event code&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This approach has resolved the printing problem in a development environment. Confirmation of resolution on the client&amp;rsquo;s server is pending. If this solution proves ineffective, an alternative workaround involves printing the report to screen first before printing to the physical printer.&lt;/p>

The release of the Apple iPad and its allowance of VoIP applications over 3G cellular networks, along with AT&amp;amp;T&amp;rsquo;s network adjustments for this capability, signal a potential shift in the telecommunications landscape.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why is this significant? Cellular networks have historically blocked VoIP due to its potential to congest networks and cannibalize voice call revenue. Traditional cellular systems were designed for voice calls, with data services as a more recent addition. Carriers allocate limited bandwidth between voice and data, and the introduction of unlimited data plans opened the door for users to bypass voice plans entirely using VoIP services like Skype.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, several factors are mitigating this concern. The rise of unlimited voice and data plans renders the distinction between voice and data usage less important for billing purposes. More importantly, the surge in bandwidth demand from data-intensive applications like video streaming is dwarfing voice call requirements. Carriers are rapidly upgrading infrastructure to accommodate this data explosion, shifting the focus from voice to data services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As data usage continues to dominate, the traditional model of voice minutes may become obsolete. Future pricing models might involve pay-as-you-go for all services or flat fees for unlimited usage. Cellular carriers will evolve into wireless broadband providers, catering to mobile devices capable of both voice and data communication. While traditional cellular service may decline, wireless technology will continue to thrive in this new data-centric landscape.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Restoration of the Arm Lowering Mechanism, Replacement of Tracking Sensor Light Bulb with a LED Assembly, and a New Aluminum Pulley</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-restoration-of-the-arm-lowering-mechanism-replacement-of-tracking-sensor-light-bulb-with-a-led-assembly-and-a-new-aluminum-pulley/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jun 2024 23:46:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-restoration-of-the-arm-lowering-mechanism-replacement-of-tracking-sensor-light-bulb-with-a-led-assembly-and-a-new-aluminum-pulley/</guid><description>&lt;p>My Beogram 4000 arrived damaged from shipping, so I began by fixing it. The carriage, which moves along a rod with bearings, had detached.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I took out the rod and bearings to put them back into the carriage correctly. Then, I used a wrench to secure them. This allowed me to reinstall the carriage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, I started my usual restoration process, beginning with the arm lowering mechanism. I took apart the solenoid, damper, connecting parts, and springs. I cleaned and lubricated everything before putting it back together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The connection between the damper and tonearm frequently gets stuck, so I tackled that next. I took out the sensor arm and linkage, which was tough to remove. After cleaning and greasing the pin, I reassembled everything and realigned the arm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The last step was replacing the tracking sensor&amp;rsquo;s light source. After removing the old bulb housing, I found that the aperture was out of place due to the shipping damage. I installed a 3D-printed LED assembly and a new machined aluminum pulley to complete the repair.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next step is restoring the carriage movement contacts, which I’ll cover in my next post.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>1,000,000 Miles of Metro Ethernet Fiber And Growing</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/1-000-000-miles-of-metro-ethernet-fiber-and-growing/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jun 2024 23:09:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/1-000-000-miles-of-metro-ethernet-fiber-and-growing/</guid><description>&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t assume Metro Ethernet is a small, insignificant service. XO Communications alone has a vast network of metro fiber, connecting thousands of buildings. And that&amp;rsquo;s just one provider, not even counting Ethernet over Copper options.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Metro Ethernet and its long-distance counterpart, Carrier Ethernet, are the future of telecommunications. The world is shifting from traditional circuit-based communication to packet-based IP networks. While your current internet might be a T1 line, your data likely transitions to an IP-based backbone at your provider&amp;rsquo;s location.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This transition makes it more efficient to use Ethernet technology throughout the network, from your device to the servers you access. With Ethernet in the WAN becoming as common as in your LAN, it&amp;rsquo;s a cost-effective solution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Curious about potential savings? You can easily compare Metro Ethernet prices and availability online. Websites like Ethernet Buildings simplify the process, allowing you to check options by simply entering your address.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even if your building doesn&amp;rsquo;t have fiber optic service yet, Ethernet over Copper or wireless options might be available. Providers like XO Communications are actively investing in these technologies to offer competitive services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t miss out on potential savings on your monthly telecom costs. Explore your options today – it only takes a few minutes and could lead to significant discounts. Check Ethernet service availability for your business location now.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The reason I do not accept foreign checks is due to the complexities of North American banking.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-reason-i-do-not-accept-foreign-checks-is-due-to-the-complexities-of-north-american-banking/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jun 2024 19:48:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-reason-i-do-not-accept-foreign-checks-is-due-to-the-complexities-of-north-american-banking/</guid><description>&lt;p>Years ago, I received a US dollar check from a Canadian Dynamics partner paying their invoice. They used their Canadian bank&amp;rsquo;s US dollar account, thinking it would simplify things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I assumed a US dollar check for a US dollar invoice would be straightforward. I was wrong.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My local Bank of America ATM wouldn&amp;rsquo;t accept the check. Inside, the teller and even the manager were perplexed. The manager confidently declared they couldn&amp;rsquo;t accept the check because it was a US dollar check from a Canadian bank. He claimed their policy prevented accepting checks where the origin country and currency differed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He instructed me to fill out a form and mail the check in a special envelope to &amp;ldquo;Foreign Clean Collections&amp;rdquo; for review and processing, which would take 6-8 weeks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Skeptical but curious, I followed their process. Weeks later, only $800 of the $1,000 appeared in my account. They deducted a $200 fee!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following this experience, I refused foreign checks, insisting on credit cards or wire transfers from international clients – a system that worked flawlessly for years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recently, a Canadian partner overlooked my clear instructions and sent a US dollar check from their Canadian bank. A colleague mentioned routinely depositing similar checks at their Bank of America branch without issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, having learned my lesson and paid the &amp;ldquo;Foreign Clean Collections Club&amp;rdquo; fee, I contacted my local branch for clarification.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first representative transferred me to the unavailable back office. Reaching the main customer service led to another dead end, as they couldn&amp;rsquo;t find information or connect me to the relevant department. Finally, the Foreign Exchange Call Center provided some insight.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Their stance? Every foreign check is reviewed individually. They had no clear policy on deposits, which essentially meant their policy was arbitrary and subject to the whims of individual branches and their training.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The branch might attempt to process the check through their system. This system, based on unknown algorithms, decides if the branch can accept the check. Acceptance supposedly means a standard deposit process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rejection initiates the &amp;ldquo;Foreign Clean Collections&amp;rdquo; process: forms, envelopes, weeks of waiting, and unpredictable fees. While they claim a flat $40 fee, the issuing bank might impose additional charges, like the $150 I was charged by the Canadian bank.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Their recommendation for receiving international payments? Wire transfers. They discouraged foreign checks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While some claim to deposit foreign checks without issue, I prefer to avoid the hassle of unreliable bank processes and potential fees. Checks are outdated, especially with modern alternatives like wire transfers and credit cards offering convenience and security.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wire transfers have existed for over a century and enable fast, international transfers with transparent fees. Credit cards are widely accepted, offer fraud protection and rewards, with the merchant (me) covering the fees. Services like TransferWise provide cost-effective international EFT transfers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The persistence of checks in North America seems rooted in the lack of fees for processing paper-based transactions, while electronic transfers incur charges.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After this latest investigation, my policy remains unchanged: credit cards or wire transfers from international clients. It&amp;rsquo;s a system that aligns with global banking practices.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fiber Optic Leased Lines for Business</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/fiber-optic-leased-lines-for-business/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jun 2024 18:49:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/fiber-optic-leased-lines-for-business/</guid><description>&lt;p>Traditional copper leased lines for business connectivity are becoming outdated in the face of increasing demand for bandwidth-intensive applications like big data, HD video, and cloud computing. Fiber optic lines are emerging as the preferred solution, offering lower prices and more choices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://www.FiberNetworkQuotes.com/images/EarthSpaceNightA250.jpg"

>http://www.fibernetworkquotes.com/&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While large companies and bandwidth-heavy industries have used fiber optic leased lines for a long time, the technology is now becoming more accessible. Historically, most fiber bandwidth relied on SONET (Synchronous Optical NETworking), a standard originating from the telephone industry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SONET picks up where copper-based T-carrier lines reach their limit. While T1 lines offer speeds up to 12 Mbps and T3 (DS3) lines provide 45 Mbps, SONET starts at 155 Mbps with OC-3 and scales up to much higher bandwidths.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SONET service levels increase in large increments, with OC-12 at 622 Mbps, OC-24 at 1.2 Gbps, OC-48 at 2.5 Gbps, OC-192 at 10 Gbps, and OC-768 at 40 Gbps. This large gap between levels may require businesses to purchase more bandwidth than needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a TDM (Time Division Multiplexed) technology, SONET divides the signal into small, synchronized channels, reflecting its telephony heritage. This setup requires protocol conversion for compatibility with packet-switched Ethernet networks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Despite needing protocol conversion, SONET is widely deployed and recognized for its reliability. Its ring topology, using two redundant fibers, ensures data flow even during network issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A newer alternative, Ethernet over Fiber (EoF), specifically Carrier Ethernet, offers advantages over SONET. Carrier Ethernet provides scalability, direct compatibility with existing networks, and cost savings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Carrier Ethernet offers various service levels, including 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps, and 10 Gbps, with the flexibility to select almost any bandwidth. Upgrading bandwidth is also simpler and faster with Carrier Ethernet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While relatively new, Carrier Ethernet is gaining popularity due to lower costs and scalability. This competition has driven down SONET prices, making fiber options more affordable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Businesses looking for increased bandwidth, better pricing on existing fiber connections, or optimal solutions for new applications should explore the options available with SONET and Ethernet fiber optic leased lines.&lt;/p>

Reconciling means performing these steps after each payroll:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Print the Check Register:&lt;/strong> This document, usually generated automatically after posting payroll, details your tax liabilities.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Print the Payroll Summary Report:&lt;/strong> Covering the current quarter up to the payroll check date (accessible via Reports-Payroll-Period End), this report should match your cumulative payroll check registers in terms of wages, taxes, etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Print the 941 Report:&lt;/strong> Also encompassing the current quarter, this report should align with the Payroll Summary Report for wages, taxes, etc. Additionally, its Schedule B should correspond with your check registers on a date basis.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Apply this same process for state taxes: compare the state tax register generated during payroll posting with the state tax summary from Reports-Payroll-Period End. This cumulative approach helps catch off-cycle changes, voids, and simplifies quarterly reconciliation by allowing ongoing comparison with your accumulating 941 data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Addressing discrepancies becomes easier when you know the originating payroll or adjustment period. However, unforeseen circumstances happen. If you need to backtrack and reconcile multiple payrolls, particularly after going live, a helpful check is ensuring the tax flags on individual employee pay codes, benefits, and deductions match the overall setup (compare Cards-Payroll to Setup-Payroll). The provided script accomplishes this for pay codes but can be adjusted for benefits or deductions.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Toll-free numbers are beneficial for businesses with a public phone number. Local customers can call without long-distance charges, but even calls from nearby areas can become expensive. Out-of-state prospects might hesitate to call due to high long-distance rates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Offering a toll-free number encourages calls from anywhere, as the business covers the cost. Customers often expect toll-free numbers for sales and support, making businesses without them appear less credible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What callers don&amp;rsquo;t realize is the affordability. Toll-free numbers can be registered for as low as $2 with a $2 monthly fee, making them accessible to businesses of all sizes. Per-minute charges apply only for received calls, starting at 6.9 cents for calls within the contiguous U.S. This cost-effective approach ensures you&amp;rsquo;re connecting with serious leads and customers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kall8 Toll Free Service enhances this with features like voicemail, call blocking, caller ID, call forwarding, and conference calling. Uniquely, Kall8 allows you to direct incoming toll-free calls to any number – office, home, or cell – providing flexibility and ensuring missed calls are minimized, especially for professionals on the go.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kall8 also caters to mobile professionals by integrating fax-to-email and voicemail-to-email features, allowing access to messages from anywhere with an internet connection.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This comprehensive service is surprisingly affordable, starting at $2 per month. Additional features include detailed call reports accessible through an online control panel. The versatility of this service extends to marketing agencies, who can utilize multiple toll-free numbers to track responses to individual ads. With their cost-effectiveness, toll-free numbers become an invaluable business tool.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Last Minute Online Gifts For Good</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/last-minute-online-gifts-for-good/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jun 2024 09:58:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/last-minute-online-gifts-for-good/</guid><description>&lt;p>_On Christmas Eve, instead of the typical peaceful house,&lt;br>

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Professor Stephen Weatherill, Faculty of Law and Somerville College, University of Oxford, analyzes the attempted formation of a European SuperLeague and what it reveals about the weaknesses in European football governance and legal frameworks. He argues that while the SuperLeague ultimately failed, the desire for such a league persists and requires proactive legal and structural reforms to safeguard the European model of sport.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>A Persistent Threat&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The proposed SuperLeague, driven by wealthy and commercially successful clubs, posed a significant challenge to UEFA, the governing body of European football. UEFA has historically responded to the threat of a breakaway league by appeasing these clubs, making changes to the structure of the Champions League to benefit them. However, the recent SuperLeague proposal was an attempt to circumvent UEFA entirely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The SuperLeague&amp;rsquo;s structure, guaranteeing long-term participation for founding members and disregarding the traditional model of promotion and relegation, drew widespread criticism. This, along with public pressure, ultimately led to its swift collapse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Despite its failure, the concept of a breakaway league remains appealing to some powerful clubs. This necessitates a thorough examination of the legal framework governing sports in Europe, particularly the inadequacy of existing regulations in preventing such leagues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Legal Loopholes and Regulatory Overlaps&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>UEFA&amp;rsquo;s role is twofold: it regulates European football and operates as a commercial entity through tournaments like the Champions League. This duality creates a conflict of interest when addressing breakaway leagues. While UEFA has a legitimate interest in protecting the integrity and structure of European football, its opposition to the SuperLeague also stemmed from a desire to protect its commercial interests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>EU competition law, particularly Article 101 TFEU, complicates the issue. The International Skating Union (ISU) case, where the Commission found the ISU&amp;rsquo;s eligibility rules anti-competitive, provides some insight. The ruling highlighted the need for governing bodies to act proportionately and avoid leveraging regulatory power for commercial gain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While the ISU case offers some guidance, the power dynamics between UEFA and the major football clubs differ significantly from those in the ISU case. The question of where regulation ends and anti-competitive behavior begins remains ambiguous.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Past cases such as &lt;em>Meca Medina and Majcen v Commission&lt;/em> and &lt;em>MOTOE&lt;/em> underscore the EU&amp;rsquo;s acknowledgment of the need for regulation in sports while emphasizing that it should not be misused for commercial advantage. The EU’s approach allows for what has been termed ‘conditional autonomy’ for sports governing bodies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>UEFA&amp;rsquo;s Options and the Need for Reform&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is unclear if EU law would have allowed UEFA to take action against the SuperLeague. UEFA could argue that it was acting to preserve the integrity of European football by ensuring a single, merit-based pathway to determine the best club in Europe. However, the lack of clear legal precedent makes predicting the outcome difficult.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The SuperLeague&amp;rsquo;s collapse highlights the need for a more robust legal framework for sports in Europe. UEFA&amp;rsquo;s dependence on urgent consultations and the lack of clear legal guidelines underscore the system&amp;rsquo;s fragility.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Path Forward: Embracing Reform over Autonomy&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The SuperLeague fiasco presents an opportunity for UEFA to reconsider its stance on EU involvement in sports regulation. While UEFA has historically guarded its autonomy, the threat posed by breakaway leagues might necessitate a strategic shift towards collaboration with the EU.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A closer relationship with the EU could offer UEFA much-needed support in protecting the European model of sport. The EU could play a role in establishing clear governance standards, ensuring merit-based competition structures, and promoting financial fairness within European football. This could lead to a more robust ‘European Model of Sport’, one that is more than just rhetoric.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, national governments could consider legislation to prevent closed leagues and promote financial fairness within their football pyramids. While this represents an increase in state intervention in sport, it might be necessary to counter the immense power of wealthy clubs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Conclusion&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The failed SuperLeague exposes the vulnerabilities in European football&amp;rsquo;s governance. While this immediate threat has subsided, the underlying issues persist. The need for a clearly defined legal framework for sports in Europe, one that balances the autonomy of governing bodies with the need for fair competition and the preservation of traditional sporting values, is now more apparent than ever. Without reform, the possibility of another attempt at a breakaway league, potentially more sophisticated and successful, remains a genuine threat.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) offers a solution. While not a fully private cloud, it comes close.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>VPLS allows you to share a private multipoint network built on technology like Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS). MPLS networks can handle various traffic types, including Ethernet, making it ideal for diverse needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>VPLS is essentially an Ethernet-based mesh network over an MPLS network. It uses pseudo-wires to create connections between any two points, creating a unified network experience. This makes geographically distant locations feel like parts of a single large office.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While beneficial within a metropolitan area, VPLS can connect sites across cities and even countries, limited only by the provider&amp;rsquo;s reach.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, even provider reach is no longer a limiting factor, thanks to Ethernet Exchanges like Telx. These exchanges connect multiple carriers, extending the potential reach of VPLS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>VPLS offers a cost-effective and efficient solution for organizations with multiple locations looking to connect their voice, video, and data networks seamlessly. To determine if VPLS is right for you, check the cost and availability of services in your area.&lt;/p>

This core transmission protocol, unlike its namesake, isn&amp;rsquo;t something most consumers encounter directly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ATM is a technology that falls into the same family as Ethernet, Frame Relay, and TDM. Although once considered a potential universal networking solution, it didn&amp;rsquo;t achieve that status. Nonetheless, a significant portion of telecom providers, around 80%, currently utilize ATM within their networks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This might seem surprising given the buzz around Ethernet advancements like Fast, Gigabit, and 10 Gigabit Ethernet. ATM&amp;rsquo;s relevance stems from its design, intended to handle any digitized voice, video, or data protocol by packaging them into small, uniform 53-byte packets (cells) with 5 bytes for the header and 48 for data. Larger data streams are divided among multiple cells.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This uniform cell structure simplifies network operations, allowing for hardware-based packet handling which is more efficient. This efficiency makes it suitable for high-speed optical carrier networks like OC3 and OC12, where ATM finds its primary application, and even scales up to OC48 and beyond.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ATM networks utilize switches instead of routers because data travels over predetermined virtual circuits on virtual paths, ensuring all cells follow the same route from origin to destination, maintaining their order. This is crucial for voice and video transmission, minimizing jitter and ensuring smooth, synchronized delivery.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>IP routing, conversely, can direct packets through different paths. While this adds robustness by enabling rerouting in case of network disruptions, it introduces variable packet arrival times, leading to delays and jitter. Such inconsistencies disrupt real-time data streams like voice or video, rendering out-of-sequence packets useless.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Despite its strengths, ATM is unlikely to dominate the networking landscape. Initially, it was projected to replace Ethernet as the latter&amp;rsquo;s speed limits were anticipated to become inadequate. However, Ethernet evolved with faster speeds and enhancements, solidifying its dominance in local area networks (LANs). Consequently, ATM found its niche in metropolitan and wide area networks (WANs), creating a division where LANs typically use Ethernet and WANs utilize ATM.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The push for a standardized IP environment is leading to end-to-end Ethernet deployments, simplifying network management. Whether WAN trunks will fully transition to a native IP format or simply carry IP over ATM remains to be seen. However, ATM might see renewed relevance as digitized voice and video traffic increases within networks.&lt;/p>

While upgrading from a T1 line to a DS3 might have seemed expensive in the past, prices have gone down. Even with the current economic climate, a DS3 connection could now be within your budget.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>DS3, or Data Service level 3, is a digital telecommunications standard initially designed for telephone systems. It&amp;rsquo;s part of the T-Carrier system and works seamlessly with SONET fiber optic networks. A DS3 line typically offers 45 Mbps. Though once delivered via coaxial copper cable, most DS3 connections now utilize fiber optic cables. A single DS3 uses only a small portion of the fiber&amp;rsquo;s capacity, allowing for multiple DS3s to be bundled and transmitted across long distances.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What are the uses of DS3? Large companies might use a dedicated DS3 internet connection to support numerous employees, potentially up to hundreds. When used for telephone services, a single DS3 connection can handle up to 672 simultaneous calls. This capacity is suitable for large corporations or call centers needing extensive phone service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The cost of a DS3 connection is often quoted around $5,000 per month. However, this price can be significantly lower, potentially half, based on your location and the length of the contract. Areas with a denser population usually have more DS3 availability and competition among providers, leading to better prices. Online tools are available to get a DS3 quote for your business address in a matter of minutes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What if installing fiber optic cable at your location isn&amp;rsquo;t feasible? Another option, Ethernet over Copper (EoC), is gaining popularity in urban areas. EoC&amp;rsquo;s bandwidth varies depending on the distance from the provider&amp;rsquo;s Point of Presence (POP) but can reach DS3 levels of 45 Mbps. You can obtain a quote for Ethernet over Copper bandwidth online. Where available, this service is typically more affordable than DS3 on a per-Mbps basis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even if your business is located in a remote area without access to fiber optic cables, there are still voice and data connection solutions. Bonded T1 lines, which combine multiple pairs of standard telephone cables, can provide speeds of 10 Mbps or more. This option gives you cost control because you determine the number of lines to bond, allowing you to match your needs and budget and upgrade as your demands increase. Request a quote for bonded T1 service to see the affordability for your location.&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s a disaster, leading to lost sales and potentially losing valuable customers. If customers go elsewhere during downtime, they may never return, putting your business at risk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While numerous risks can disrupt your business, connectivity is one you can control. Most businesses, even traditional brick-and-mortar ones, rely heavily on electronic connections like phones and the internet to operate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Losing these vital connections can be devastating. While a hotdog vendor might not be affected, businesses like stockbrokers or online retailers with on-site servers would be crippled. Point-of-sale system failures can bring businesses to a standstill.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This raises the question of using a &amp;ldquo;costly&amp;rdquo; T1 line versus a &amp;ldquo;budget-friendly&amp;rdquo; DSL or Cable Modem connection. While they might offer similar advertised bandwidth (e.g., 1.5 Mbps), DSL&amp;rsquo;s lower cost of $50-$150 per month can be tempting compared to a T1&amp;rsquo;s significantly higher price. Why would a cost-conscious business choose to pay more for seemingly the same service?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When everything functions flawlessly, the differences might seem negligible. However, T1 dedicated internet provides symmetrical upload and download speeds and dedicated bandwidth, generally outperforming business DSL and consumer-grade internet services. But the true value of T1 lies in its service guarantee.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>T1 lines come with a Service Level Agreement (SLA), a contractual agreement outlining the provider&amp;rsquo;s response time to outages and the compensation you receive during downtime. This &amp;ldquo;insurance policy&amp;rdquo; incentivizes the provider to address and resolve issues swiftly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In contrast, DSL or Cable modem internet offers &amp;ldquo;best effort&amp;rdquo; service without guaranteed performance levels. While providers will work to restore service, the time frame can be unpredictable, ranging from hours to days. T1 downtime usually receives attention within 30 minutes to a maximum of 4 hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Therefore, the true cost comparison between T1 and DSL goes beyond the advertised price. Consider the potential financial impact of downtime on your business. How much revenue would you lose in an hour, a day, or two? Could it be $1,000, $5,000, or even $10,000? If so, that seemingly affordable DSL connection could become significantly more expensive after a single outage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The emergence of VoIP has further intertwined phone service with internet connectivity. Losing a DSL connection that supports your phones, computers, and web server can be completely paralyzing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While only you can determine the specific risk to your business, alternatives to consumer-grade connectivity exist. Integrated T1 services, for instance, combine traditional phone lines and internet access on a single T1 line, potentially saving money compared to multiple phone lines and a separate DSL connection, all while benefiting from an SLA. Another option is a fractional T1 line, providing a portion of the bandwidth at a reduced cost while retaining the crucial service level agreement.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>T1 Rex partners with numerous top-tier service providers, offering competitive pricing on various T1 solutions, including dedicated internet access, integrated voice and data service, fractional T1 lines, and local/long-distance phone lines. Their team of experts can guide you in selecting the most cost-effective service for your specific business needs.

Should they stick with their existing Key Telephone or PBX system and upgrade it, or is it time to transition to VoIP? What many businesses may not realize is the wide range of options that VoIP solutions offer.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/a>The key difference between VoIP and traditional phone systems lies in its network-based approach. While even a single-line phone or cell phone operates on a network, known as the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), this network has limitations. It excels at connecting individual phones or facilitating conference calls but operates within its own technology and wiring constraints. In contrast, VoIP is designed to function seamlessly with standard computer networks that utilize packets of data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This fundamental difference highlights the adaptability of VoIP. Similar to connecting a computer or printer, an IP phone simply plugs into a network jack, eliminating the need for specialized wiring. Location becomes irrelevant as IP phones are identified by unique addresses rather than physical connections.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Traditional phone systems require businesses to choose between connecting each phone directly to the phone company or implementing an in-house phone system to share outside lines. VoIP offers similar flexibility, allowing for an in-house system called an IP PBX or extending the network to a service provider through Hosted VoIP or Hosted PBX. This connection, known as a SIP Trunk, offers several advantages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SIP Trunking allows businesses to consolidate their phone and internet services with a single provider. The SIP trunk can be configured to prioritize voice and data packets, preventing disruptions to calls during data-intensive activities. This combined approach often leads to cost savings compared to separate phone lines and internet connections.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hosted PBX services provide businesses with unparalleled flexibility in phone placement. Beyond simply rearranging phones within an office, a hosted PBX enables phones in different geographical locations to function seamlessly as if they were under one roof. This capability, known as a virtual office, is made possible by SIP trunks connecting phones, regardless of their physical location.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For larger enterprises, robust VoIP systems manage hundreds or even thousands of phones distributed across headquarters, regional offices, and branches. Private SIP Trunks securely facilitate voice and data transmission between these locations, bypassing expensive phone company charges for internal calls. The central PBX system can be located on-site or hosted, offering flexibility and scalability. One of the most significant advantages of hosted VoIP is its pay-as-you-go model, eliminating the need for substantial upfront investments in equipment and dedicated staff for maintenance and upgrades.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Introduction&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Czech Supreme Administrative Court referred a question to the Court of Justice regarding the &amp;ldquo;household activity&amp;rdquo; exception in the EU Data Protection Directive. This case, Ryneš, involved CCTV footage capturing images beyond the operator&amp;rsquo;s property, raising questions about the exception&amp;rsquo;s scope, especially since the Directive states data processing must be &amp;ldquo;exclusively&amp;rdquo; for personal and household purposes. While Member States handle this differently, the Court, besides the Lindqvist case, hasn&amp;rsquo;t clarified the household exception&amp;rsquo;s applicability. The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, recognizing privacy and data protection rights, adds another layer to this. The Advocate General&amp;rsquo;s Opinion, published later than planned, addresses these issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Facts&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mr. Ryneš installed a CCTV camera on his house, capturing his front door, public footpath, and the opposite house, aiming to deter property crime. Despite the camera, his windows were vandalized. The footage helped identify suspects, but one questioned the CCTV system&amp;rsquo;s legality under Czech data protection law, which implements the EU Directive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Question Referred&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Citing Article 3(2) of the Data Protection Directive, which outlines a &amp;ldquo;household exception&amp;rdquo; for personal or household activities, Mr. Ryneš argued his CCTV use fell under this exception. The Court then needed to clarify if using a camera system on a family home for protection, even if it captures public spaces, qualifies as &amp;ldquo;processing of personal data… by a natural person in the course of a purely personal or household activity.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Opinion of the Advocate General&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Advocate General highlighted that data storage, erasure, or usage were irrelevant; the focus was on the constant surveillance by the fixed CCTV system. This opinion didn&amp;rsquo;t cover different devices like mobile phones. The Advocate General stressed the Charter&amp;rsquo;s relevance and the need to interpret the Directive, particularly its limitations, in light of the right to privacy, echoing principles from the Google Spain case. He emphasized the need for a high level of protection in both public and private contexts, as stated in the Digital Rights Ireland judgment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Advocate General differentiated between police activities and Mr. Ryneš&amp;rsquo;s, stating that Mr. Ryneš wasn&amp;rsquo;t acting as law enforcement, despite providing footage to them. Therefore, the policing exception didn&amp;rsquo;t apply. He argued that objective factors, not subjective views, should define the Directive&amp;rsquo;s scope. Referencing cases like Satamedia and Lindqvist, he stated that exceptions and limitations should be interpreted narrowly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Drawing parallels to AG Tizzano&amp;rsquo;s example of personal correspondence and address books in Lindqvist, the Advocate General suggested limiting the exception to activities that are clearly private and confidential. This encompasses activities inherently linked to private life without significant intrusion on others&amp;rsquo;. Family life, while not limited to homes, has a clear connection with the domestic sphere. For the household exception to apply, there&amp;rsquo;s an added requirement of exclusivity, applicable to both private and family life. He concluded that while video surveillance of others isn&amp;rsquo;t exclusively &amp;ldquo;personal,&amp;rdquo; it could fall under &amp;ldquo;domestic activity.&amp;rdquo; However, expanding surveillance to public areas isn&amp;rsquo;t exclusively domestic due to its impact on others&amp;rsquo; desire for anonymity. The concern, as highlighted in Digital Rights Ireland, is the implications of constant surveillance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Therefore, the Advocate General concluded that the household exception couldn&amp;rsquo;t be applied in this case.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comment&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This case seems to follow a pattern of the Court and its Advocates General interpreting the Data Protection Directive to enhance data subject protection. This is evident in their attention to Google Spain and references to Digital Rights Ireland. While Lindqvist informed the detailed understanding of Article 3(2), it didn&amp;rsquo;t significantly influence the overall approach. While Satamedia allowed a broad interpretation of the “journalistic exception” in Article 9, this case differs because Article 3(2) removes data from the Directive&amp;rsquo;s scope entirely, and unlike Article 9, there&amp;rsquo;s no countervailing interest like freedom of expression.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A recurring theme is the impact of constant surveillance on individuals and society, aligning with recent cases and mirroring ECHR case law. While the Advocate-General disregarded Peck (concerning security footage reuse by local authorities), existing case law addresses state surveillance, such as Liberty v. UK and the ongoing Big Brother Watch v. UK. The Advocate-General avoided discussing other surveillance devices like mobile phones, claiming different characteristics, but the underlying concern about surveillance&amp;rsquo;s impact on individuals remains. Mobile phone use, however, tends to be individual instances, potentially falling under the household exception.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Devices like Google Glass, enabling continuous recording, blur the line of when monitoring occurs. This differs significantly from using a mobile phone for filming, despite Google&amp;rsquo;s claims that Google Glass is similar. If the Court agrees with the Advocate General, it impacts the UK Information Commissioner’s (ICO) advice on Google Glass, which suggests &amp;ldquo;personal use&amp;rdquo; as non-business use, possibly triggering data protection procedures. Data Protection Commissioners have expressed concerns about Google Glass and local law compliance. Perhaps the ECJ&amp;rsquo;s stance might grab Google’s attention, though the burden and penalty risks seem to fall on users.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>There is an issue with sending PDF reports via email using GP 2010 and Office 2010.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/there-is-an-issue-with-sending-pdf-reports-via-email-using-gp-2010-and-office-2010/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jun 2024 16:17:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/there-is-an-issue-with-sending-pdf-reports-via-email-using-gp-2010-and-office-2010/</guid><description>&lt;p>During a recent Electronic Funds Transfer setup for a client, I encountered an error in Microsoft Dynamics GP 2010 R2 while trying to email remittance documents as PDFs. The error message, &amp;ldquo;You must have the Microsoft Save as PDF or XPS Add-in for 2007 Microsoft Office installed to send documents,&amp;rdquo; persisted even with Office 2010 (32-bit) installed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This error, encountered by others as well, hinted at a problem with GP&amp;rsquo;s ability to convert and email reports as PDFs. While emailing DOCX files worked, PDF conversion failed. Interestingly, the same process worked flawlessly on a second server with a default Office 2010 installation, suggesting a server-specific issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Suspecting my minimalist Office installation, I realized I had excluded the &amp;ldquo;.NET Programmability Support&amp;rdquo; feature under Microsoft Word during installation. I typically disable unused features, but this omission proved problematic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After reinstalling Office 2010 with &amp;ldquo;.NET Programmability Support&amp;rdquo; enabled, GP 2010 R2 successfully emailed PDF attachments. This component, though seemingly unrelated, is vital for GP&amp;rsquo;s PDF conversion process during emailing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While other factors can cause this error, my experience highlights a less obvious one. My meticulous Office setup inadvertently led to this issue, showcasing the importance of this specific Word 2010 feature for seamless PDF emailing in GP 2010.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cellular Netbooks Are Downright Cheap</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/cellular-netbooks-are-downright-cheap/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jun 2024 12:51:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/cellular-netbooks-are-downright-cheap/</guid><description>&lt;p>Do you spend most of your computing time on the go? If so, a computer designed for mobility might be perfect for you, like one of the new netbooks with built-in 3G cellular internet access.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You might be thinking laptops aren&amp;rsquo;t that bulky and work fine at a coffee shop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s true. A laptop with a wireless modem aircard would be comparable to a netbook in functionality. However, laptops are heavier and often carry unnecessary extras.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Netbooks prioritize mobile computing, being half the size and weight of standard laptops. They boast larger screens than smartphones and spacious QWERTY keyboards, outperforming smartphones and messaging-focused phones for internet use. Moreover, they have hard drives, fast processors, and enough RAM to handle a standard operating system like Windows XP Home Edition, which is used in several popular models.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Netbooks omit CD or DVD drives as they are designed for online operation, not for complex image editing or playing DVDs. You can enjoy multimedia content online as needed. As internet-centric devices, netbooks are shifting towards integrated 3G cellular wireless connectivity alongside standard WiFi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With 3G wireless, you can access the internet from anywhere with cellular service. While the wireless modem aircards in netbooks only utilize the data signals from cell towers and not voice, they enable web browsing and emailing from your car, the bus, or a client&amp;rsquo;s office. Need to finalize a deal? Grab your netbook and enter the order right there with your customer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Netbooks are more affordable than laptops, ranging from $300 to $600. You can even snag one for a steal by bundling it with a cellular data plan. For instance, an Acer Aspire One with a two-year AT&amp;amp;T 3G wireless plan can be yours for $49.99. Similar to cell phone subsidies, the carrier offsets the netbook cost. This deal requires a 2-year, 5 GB monthly data plan for $60 per month.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To explore current cell phone deals and free phone offers, use the Cell Phone Plan Finder to compare top phones and their associated wireless plans. You can also purchase netbooks without a data plan at a higher price and rely on WiFi hotspots for internet access.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If a smartphone or an internet-enabled cell phone like a BlackBerry is more your style, explore the free and budget-friendly options currently on Cell Phone Plans Finder.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Joske Graat&lt;/strong>, PhD student, Utrecht University&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Amsterdam District Court, solely responsible for handling European Arrest Warrants (EAWs) in the Netherlands, faces a conflict between national and EU laws regarding detention and release. Dutch law mandates the release of a requested individual after 90 days if the court hasn&amp;rsquo;t made a decision on the EAW. However, a 2015 European Court of Justice (CJEU) ruling stated that national courts can extend detention beyond 90 days to ensure conditions for surrender are met. This creates a conflict, as extending detention beyond this period contradicts Dutch law. Consequently, the obligation to release someone under Dutch law clashes with the EU&amp;rsquo;s requirement for effective surrender procedures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Amsterdam District Court attempts to address this issue by interpreting Dutch law in line with the European Arrest Warrant Framework Decision (FDEAW), but this solution presents its own problems. This interpretation, which aims to reconcile the conflicting laws, raises concerns about legal certainty for the requested individual and potentially contradicts the original intent of the Dutch law. The issue of legal certainty has prompted a request for clarification from the CJEU. However, it remains unclear if the CJEU&amp;rsquo;s interpretation will resolve the situation or create further complications. Therefore, legislative action might be necessary to address this conflict definitively.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This issue requires urgent attention because fulfilling other EU law obligations, such as addressing preliminary questions and gathering information related to potential human rights violations, often extends surrender proceedings beyond the 90-day limit. This delay could force the release of requested individuals even when there&amp;rsquo;s a flight risk, contradicting the EAW&amp;rsquo;s requirement to ensure surrender conditions are met.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Amsterdam District Court&amp;rsquo;s solution involves interpreting Dutch law to allow for the suspension of the 90-day detention period, effectively permitting detention beyond 90 days. However, this interpretation has been criticized for potentially infringing on the right to liberty, prompting a complaint to the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) and a request for a preliminary ruling from the CJEU on whether this interpretation aligns with the principle of legal certainty.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This interpretation is problematic not only because it might not guarantee legal certainty but also because it contradicts the clear wording and intent of Dutch law, which unambiguously states that release must occur after 90 days. Suspending a term before it ends and extending it after it lapses are distinct concepts, and the Dutch law clearly intends the former.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If this interpretation is deemed incompatible with EU law, the Amsterdam District Court currently lacks alternative solutions to address the conflict. While the CJEU could grant EU law supremacy over national legislation, this raises further concerns about legal certainty. Applying the supremacy rule would create uncertainty about the application of the 90-day rule, potentially undermining the individual&amp;rsquo;s right to understand the legal grounds for their detention.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Therefore, the CJEU might not be able to offer a solution that balances the Amsterdam District Court&amp;rsquo;s obligations with the need for legal certainty. Instead, the most straightforward approach would be for Dutch lawmakers to revise the relevant legislation, changing the release requirement after 90 days from an obligation to a discretionary power. This adjustment would effectively address the conflict and provide the court with a clear way to manage such cases.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>November in New York&amp;rsquo;s Finger Lakes region has been delightfully mild. I even took this photo of my garden from the roof two days ago.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The tarp in the foreground is full of shredded leaves ready to be spread. The leaves will act as mulch for the winter. You can see several raised beds on the garden&amp;rsquo;s right side with oats and mustard cover crops. I recently harvested the carrots from the two remaining beds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the left, you can see my new project: 30&amp;quot; x 30&amp;quot; garden beds framed in black plastic. I&amp;rsquo;m excited to share more about them next year. I ran out of time to plant a cover crop, but at least they are ready for spring planting. Here&amp;rsquo;s a closer look&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiTpYxhyphenhyphenxeWhs9GR1_AnKB70n4RaOuCD97EBwKTuSp-pWvGhU8Vp-h3g856YtnOVxldrTM47CP5r_lKvRYYA_d-cmpC6xG54vuPUj2-t1IRQveW1pkbl8eUO_RM0Cbdf4iNQUu1xLFuHGk/s1600/IMG_2036.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>These new beds are prepped with shredded leaves mixed into the first few inches of soil and then topped with a thick layer. It will be interesting to see how much they decompose by spring. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard the soil organisms, like earthworms, can stay active under the snow all winter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Speaking of winter, here&amp;rsquo;s a picture of the garden from today, taken at ground level&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Professor Lorna Woods from the University of Essex, and co-author of Steiner and Woods, &lt;em>EU Law&lt;/em>, discusses new EU guidelines on freedom of expression.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The European Union Council recently established guidelines for freedom of expression. These guidelines, falling under the Foreign Affairs Council, are designed for application within the framework of the Union’s Common Foreign and Security Policy, similar to previous guidelines addressing issues like torture, capital punishment, and human rights advocates. While these guidelines take cues from the EU Charter and pertinent EU treaty clauses, they primarily draw upon provisions within the United Nations’ International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), particularly the UN Human Rights Committee’s General Comment 34 on Freedom of Expression. The document includes a broader list of sources in the Annex. Notably, a gap exists between expectations the EU sets for others, especially potential Member States assessed against the Copenhagen criteria, and the recent actions of existing Member States like Hungary and the United Kingdom.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These Guidelines embody a conventional human rights framework concerning freedom of expression: a broad interpretation of freedom of expression, narrowly defined exceptions (drawing from Article 19(3) and Article 20(2) of the ICCPR addressing hate speech), and adherence to principles of legality, necessity, and proportionality. The Guidelines emphasize the importance of free speech, particularly a free media, in a democratic society. However, they also acknowledge the inherent value of speech for individual self-realization and autonomy, including identity development within society, beyond its instrumental role in seeking truth or political solutions. Despite this recognition, much of the specific content centers around journalism and media, underscoring their function as watchdogs over those in power.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The guidelines also underline the horizontal dimension of freedom of expression, particularly relevant in the context of the internet and social media, where expression is not limited to institutions and the media addressing a passive audience. This concept emphasizes the right of individuals to engage in dialogue and exchange perspectives, an aspect more prominently recognized by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights than in interpretations of Article 10 ECHR and Article 19 ICCPR. Despite this emphasis, the guidelines acknowledge the connection and potential tension between privacy and freedom of expression. Interestingly, the document seems to prioritize considerations of surveillance&amp;rsquo;s impact on speech over the tension between privacy and expression.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The guidelines highlight areas requiring immediate attention. Unsurprisingly, they prioritize ending impunity for those who target individuals, especially journalists and media personnel, for exercising their right to free expression. Beyond condemning such acts, the EU intends to urge relevant state actors to address both threats and acts of violence. If the EU takes action, it might encourage some governments to heed the UN General Assembly resolution on this matter and the Action Plan to end impunity. The guidelines’ tools section states:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Abusive restrictions on freedom of expression and violence against journalists and other media actors should be taken into account by the EU when deciding on possible suspension of cooperation, notably as regards financial assistance.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This idea has been circulating among those advocating against impunity for some time, but its practical application remains to be seen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Guidelines stress the importance of preventing laws from being used to stifle free expression and ensuring that media regulations promote, rather than restrict, freedom of expression. It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that some points within this section exceed the regulatory standards required of EU Member States, specifically regarding the independence of regulatory bodies. While the EU’s communications package and data protection framework mandate independent regulatory bodies, such provisions are absent from the Audiovisual Media Services Directive. Additionally, there&amp;rsquo;s minimal transparency regarding media ownership, an area these guidelines aim to address.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Guidelines further emphasize the significance of freedom of expression in cyberspace, particularly advocating for non-discriminatory internet access. Details regarding implementation remain limited, primarily expressing support for the multistakeholder model of internet governance outlined in EU strategies, rather than those articulated by the Internet Governance Forum or Netmundial, although the guidelines suggest future engagement with these entities. Acknowledging the role of private companies, the guidelines propose best practices reflecting the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, as interpreted through the EU guidance note for ICT companies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The primary action point, however, is international collaboration to establish best practices and uphold human rights in the export of technologies that could be used for surveillance or censorship by authoritarian regimes, although the document doesn’t address the United States in this context. The guidelines reiterate the importance of safeguarding against excessive surveillance and its detrimental effects on freedom of expression, specifying that EU action will involve promoting the exchange of good practices. This exchange is intended to ensure that state laws and procedures concerning communication surveillance and data interception are grounded in the rule of law, overseen by independent and effective domestic mechanisms, and adhere to international human rights obligations, including proportionality and necessity. Some Member States might need to reflect on their practices in this regard. While referencing Council Common Position 2008/944/CFSP on exporting specific military technologies doesn’t add much, the statement that the EU will ensure a structured and consistent approach to export controls for sensitive information and ICT items holds significant weight. However, the statement’s precise implications remain unclear. Does it, for instance, address concerns about mobile technology with built-in backdoors created at the behest of Western governments? The subsequent sentence focuses on technology specifically designed for surveillance or censorship, suggesting a much narrower scope.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, the Guidelines incorporate provisions for evaluation, including a progress report to be delivered in three years. While some aspects align with global priorities, like concerns about violence against journalists, a topic high on the UN’s agenda, and widespread condemnation of mass surveillance, the EU’s advocacy for such behaviors rings hollow. This is especially true given that some of its Member States have, at best, an inconsistent track record in upholding these very principles.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A recent conversation about knots, sparked by my post on un-bungee cords, reminded me of a daring experience from the early 1980s: my first rappelling adventure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the time, I was working as a carpenter for Clancy Edmonds, who had hired Dan, a machinist, for the summer. Dan, a memorable character who rode a Harley Davidson and carried a .357 magnum, even convinced me to get my handgun permit, arguing it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be as easy in the future. He was right.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dan had a friend named Chip who was an experienced rock climber. When I expressed my interest in the activity, they offered to teach me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We decided to rappel Carpenter Falls in Niles, New York, a place I had discovered while exploring my new neighborhood. It was a secluded and beautiful spot, a stark contrast to the suburban environment I was used to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today, Carpenter Falls is a protected nature preserve named after Hu Bahar, a remarkable man I had the pleasure of meeting through a mutual connection. However, back then, it was a popular, albeit sometimes dangerous, spot for weekend gatherings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unaware of any restrictions, we set out on our adventure. Chip, who had the necessary equipment, provided us with a quick lesson. He stressed the importance of the figure-eight knot, claiming that every rock climber should master it even when inebriated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We secured the ropes to a small tree near the edge of the falls – I had my doubts about its stability – and Chip went first, demonstrating the technique. With my boss and Marlene watching from below, I followed suit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rappelling down Carpenter Falls wasn&amp;rsquo;t straightforward; the lack of footholds meant relying solely on controlled rope descent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Halfway down, disaster struck. My t-shirt got caught in the equipment, leaving me stranded. Chip, after observing my predicament, climbed back up and, with a well-placed cut, freed me. Relieved, I completed the descent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Both Dan and Tim had their turn, sharing in the exhilaration. I went once more but that was the extent of my rappelling career.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="heading">&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This video captures the essence of the falls (watching it makes me slightly queasy now)&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The European Union should consider the UK police's use of live facial recognition technology when developing regulations for law enforcement.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-european-union-should-consider-the-uk-police-s-use-of-live-facial-recognition-technology-when-developing-regulations-for-law-enforcement/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jun 2024 14:07:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-european-union-should-consider-the-uk-police-s-use-of-live-facial-recognition-technology-when-developing-regulations-for-law-enforcement/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="divergent-approaches-to-regulating-live-facial-recognition">Divergent Approaches to Regulating Live Facial Recognition&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Dr. Asress Adimi Gikay, a Senior Lecturer in AI, Disruptive Innovation, and Law at Brunel University London, explores the contrasting approaches to regulating live facial recognition (LFR) in the UK and the European Union.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recent suggestions by UK officials to use LFR for searching national passport databases to combat shoplifting have sparked debate, particularly as London, a city with a high concentration of CCTV cameras, grapples with AI safety concerns. While the UK police have been utilizing LFR for several years, with reported successes in apprehending suspects, the EU&amp;rsquo;s proposed AI Act initially aimed to ban the technology outright, though recent negotiations suggest a potential compromise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dr. Gikay argues that the EU should consider an incremental approach to regulating LFR, similar to the UK model, which allows for adjustments based on evidence of actual harm. This approach, as detailed in Dr. Gikay&amp;rsquo;s forthcoming article in the Cambridge Law Journal, emphasizes evidence-based regulation, taking into account public perception, the technology&amp;rsquo;s benefits, and the efficacy of existing safeguards.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="why-the-eus-approach-should-be-incremental">Why the EU&amp;rsquo;s Approach Should Be Incremental&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The incrementalist approach advocates for regulating LFR and similar technologies by progressively modifying existing legal frameworks in response to demonstrable risks and harms, rather than relying solely on theoretical assessments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dr. Gikay&amp;rsquo;s proposed theory, as elaborated in the aforementioned article, emphasizes four key components: sectoralism, reliance on existing legal structures, evidence-based regulation, and flexibility. This post specifically focuses on the importance of evidence-based regulation, drawing on the UK&amp;rsquo;s experience with LFR.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="evidence-based-regulation">Evidence-Based Regulation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The EU&amp;rsquo;s stance on LFR appears to lack a comprehensive evaluation of the technology&amp;rsquo;s potential benefits and risks, public opinion, and the capacity of law enforcement to use it responsibly. The UK&amp;rsquo;s experience offers valuable insights in this regard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Public Support and Technological Advantages&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Surveys in the UK reveal considerable public support for police use of facial recognition technology, particularly in criminal investigations and public safety efforts. This aligns with reported instances where LFR has aided in apprehending suspects, including those involved in violent crimes and retail offenses, demonstrating its practical value.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While concerns regarding the accuracy of facial recognition systems, especially concerning potential biases against certain demographics, persist, studies have shown statistically insignificant discrepancies across demographic groups in UK police-used systems. Importantly, existing legal frameworks and safeguards in the UK mitigate the risk of harm stemming from any inaccuracies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Safe and Proportionate Application&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Despite concerns about potential misuse, the UK has not witnessed reported cases of serious harm due to LFR deployment by law enforcement. This contrasts with incidents in the US, where wrongful arrests highlight potential pitfalls primarily linked to police misconduct rather than inherent flaws in the technology. Notably, several US states are now revising their initial bans on facial recognition, opting for regulated use instead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The UK&amp;rsquo;s robust legal framework, including the Human Rights Act, Equality Act, and data protection regulations, ensures the responsible use of LFR. Mandatory equality impact assessments, adherence to the European Human Rights Convention regarding privacy, and strict data retention policies contribute to mitigating potential risks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Furthermore, the UK police operate under a national code of practice that outlines detailed procedures for deploying LFR, emphasizing proportionality and prohibiting its use in sensitive locations like hospitals and schools.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While concerns about privacy intrusion and surveillance expansion are understandable, these are addressed through legal limitations on the duration, purpose, and context of LFR deployment in the UK. Safeguards are in place to prevent arbitrary surveillance and ensure the protection of individual rights.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Despite criticisms, the UK legal framework provides a basis for the legitimate use of facial recognition technology by law enforcement, with avenues for redress in case of wrongful actions. Existing legal mechanisms allow for the gathering of information for crime prevention, including the use of new technologies, and provide a basis for holding police accountable for any harm caused by LFR misapplication.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>A Need for the EU to Reconsider&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The EU Commission&amp;rsquo;s initial draft of the AI Act proposed a more permissive approach to LFR for law enforcement, allowing its use in specific circumstances with strict safeguards. However, the subsequent push for a complete ban, while well-intentioned, appears to be driven more by fear-mongering than concrete evidence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The UK&amp;rsquo;s experience demonstrates that a balanced approach, as opposed to an outright ban or overly restrictive measures, can allow for the beneficial use of LFR while addressing potential risks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Towards Measured Regulation&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While the UK system might have areas for improvement, such as clearer guidelines on the types of crimes warranting LFR deployment, a complete overhaul is unnecessary. Instead, an incremental approach allows for targeted adjustments based on empirical evidence of harm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The EU&amp;rsquo;s current trajectory risks depriving society of the potential benefits of LFR based on speculative fears rather than concrete evidence. A measured approach, learning from the UK&amp;rsquo;s experience and prioritizing evidence-based regulation, offers a more balanced and ultimately more effective path forward.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Interview with Eliot Coleman</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/interview-with-eliot-coleman/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jun 2024 10:45:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/interview-with-eliot-coleman/</guid><description>&lt;p>Dateline: 9 August 2016 AD&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The UK&amp;rsquo;s post-Brexit relationship with the EU often involves discussions about the free movement of people, with the EEA Agreement frequently cited as a potential model. This piece will analyze two key distinctions between the EEA Agreement&amp;rsquo;s approach to the free movement of people and that of full EU membership.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.efta.int/media/documents/legal-texts/eea/the-eea-agreement/Main%20Text%20of%20the%20Agreement/EEAagreement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>EEA Agreement&lt;/a> integrates the EU&amp;rsquo;s single market with three members of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA): Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein. However, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t equate to EU membership for these countries. This integration theoretically provides comparable rights and responsibilities in areas like free movement (including people) and competition law. Certain areas like agricultural and fish products (Article 8(3) EEA) and tax harmonization are excluded from the Agreement. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Being bound by free movement rules as an EU member state versus as an EEA Agreement signatory presents two primary distinctions. The first is the absence of EU citizenship for EEA nationals. Secondly, the Agreement doesn&amp;rsquo;t cover immigration from non-EU nations. Therefore, while EFTA states have independently adopted some EU immigration policies like the Schengen open borders and the Dublin asylum regulations, free movement under the EEA differs significantly from the EU. Notably, legal interpretations, particularly EFTA Court rulings on citizen movement, have blurred the lines regarding these discrepancies.  &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Legally, these differences are evident in the absence of corresponding provisions in the EEA Agreement that mirror relevant EU primary law. Articles 20-25 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), establishing EU citizenship, and Article 79 TFEU, outlining non-EU citizen rights, have no EEA equivalents. This disparity extends to secondary legislation. EU laws regarding non-EU nationals, such as &lt;a class="link" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2003:251:0012:0018:en:PDF" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>Directive 2003/109/EC&lt;/a> on long-term resident rights, are not incorporated into EEA Annexes. These distinctions were recently highlighted in a Joint Declaration by the Contracting Parties when the EU&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a class="link" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2004:158:0077:0123:en:PDF" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>citizens’ Directive&lt;/a> (key legislation on free movement of citizens) was integrated into EEA law (&lt;a class="link" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A22007D0158" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Decision&lt;/a> by the EEA Joint Committee No 158/2007).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Decision, amending Annexes V and VIII, incorporated the citizens’ Directive into EEA law, making typical adjustments like replacing &amp;ldquo;Union citizen(s)&amp;rdquo; with &amp;ldquo;national(s) of EC Member States and EFTA states.&amp;rdquo; Enacted in the EEA on March 1, 2009, the citizens’ Directive has been central to four EFTA Court cases: E-4/11 &lt;em>&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.eftacourt.int/cases/detail/?tx_nvcases_pi1%5Bcase_id%5D=140&amp;amp;cHash=e78bf0e053ed8d5db740b2e0bc507c6e" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>Jabbi&lt;/a>&lt;/em> (Norway).   &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since the late 1990s, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has leveraged the concept of Union citizenship to establish rights like cross-border social security benefits, ensuring citizens&amp;rsquo; access to healthcare abroad funded by their home welfare systems, facilitating student financing portability, and securing rights for non-EU family members of EU citizens. This body of case law is rooted in the fundamental principle of Union citizenship. Consequently, the development of Union citizenship has influenced EU law, impacting national welfare and immigration frameworks through EU institutional practices. Essentially, Union citizenship strengthens and deepens EU integration. Free movement rights, decoupled from purely economic considerations, contribute to a sense of European unity. The ideal is for citizens to move freely, obligating states to dismantle barriers to movement. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>This objective is absent in the economically driven EEA Agreement. Yet, the Agreement&amp;rsquo;s intricate legal structure emphasizes aligning with and dynamically evolving alongside EU law, as evidenced in institutional practices. (See paragraph 60 of the &lt;em>Jabbi&lt;/em> case for a recent example.) Consequently, EU/EFTA bodies interpreting EEA law have largely mirrored EU legal developments, incorporating similar individual rights and corresponding state obligations within the EEA legal framework, despite the absence of parallel provisions on EU citizenship. This includes social security rights for non-economically active individuals (see Cases E-5/06 &lt;em>&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.eftacourt.int/cases/detail/?tx_nvcases_pi1%5Bcase_id%5D=90&amp;amp;cHash=f072a31c056dd6df183af7089847565b" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>73930&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The EU/EFTA institutional approach to free movement within the EEA Agreement arguably reached a turning point with E-28/15, the &lt;em>Jabbi&lt;/em> case. This case grappled with a central issue in evolving EEA law: the potential right of a non-economically active EFTA state national, who had exercised free movement rights and received welfare benefits, to reunite with a non-EU family member. While acknowledging the differences in the legal frameworks governing free movement in the EEA and the EU (especially concerning EU citizenship - see paragraph 66), the EFTA Court&amp;rsquo;s advisory opinion leaned toward granting such rights. The Court pointed to a discrepancy stemming from the EU&amp;rsquo;s revised primary law in the Maastricht, Amsterdam, Nice, and Lisbon Treaties, which were not mirrored in the main body of the EEA Agreement. It further underscored these differences by explicitly stating its reliance on legal sources within EEA law, unlike the CJEU in a comparable 2014 case (discussed &lt;a class="link" href="http://eulawanalysis.blogspot.co.uk/2014/03/family-reunion-for-eu-citizens-cjeu.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here&lt;/a>). This limitation prevented the EFTA Court from invoking Union citizenship as a legal basis (see paragraphs 68 and 71).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The central question before the EFTA Court (to which it responded affirmatively) was whether a non-economically active EEA citizen seeking family reunification with a third-country national (TCN) held rights under EEA law upon returning to their home country. In essence, the question was whether national law solely governed this scenario or if EEA law also provided certain rights.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The citizens&amp;rsquo; Directive&amp;rsquo;s limited scope made this question of scope complex within the EEA context. It typically applies to EEA citizens residing in a host state, except for specific situations outlined in Chapter 2 (e.g., exit visas), which were not relevant to this case. Instead, &lt;em>Jabbi&lt;/em> focused on an individual&amp;rsquo;s rights vis-à-vis their home state after residing in another EEA state and subsequently returning. In the EU, rights against the home state for a non-economically active citizen are covered by the concept of Union citizenship, enshrined in EU primary law articles that lack EEA counterparts. Through its advisory opinion in &lt;em>Jabbi&lt;/em>, the EFTA Court took further steps to align free movement rights in the EEA with those in the EU, transposing relevant CJEU case law (discussed &lt;a class="link" href="http://eulawanalysis.blogspot.co.uk/2014/03/family-reunion-for-eu-citizens-cjeu.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here&lt;/a>) into the EEA legal framework, despite the discrepancies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the CJEU&amp;rsquo;s body of case law on Union citizenship encompasses situations where no similar authority exists in the EEA. For example, the &lt;em>&lt;a class="link" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A62009CJ0034" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Ruiz Zambrano&lt;/a>&lt;/em> case law (Case C-34/09) grants rights to EU citizens solely based on their EU citizenship, independent of movement between EEA states. Moreover, the Union citizenship case law incorporates elements of financial solidarity, legitimizing the impact of EU law on national welfare systems, as seen in cases concerning student rights against their home states, such as C-359/13 &lt;em>Martens&lt;/em>, C-220/12 &lt;em>Thiele&lt;/em>, and C-585/11 &lt;em>Prinz and Seeberger&lt;/em> (discussed &lt;a class="link" href="http://eulawanalysis.blogspot.co.uk/2015/07/the-asymmetry-in-right-to-free-movement.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here&lt;/a>). This aspect of mutual solidarity was also key in early case law establishing Union citizenship as a fundamental status, such as C-184/99 &lt;em>&lt;a class="link" href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?pro=&amp;amp;nat=or&amp;amp;oqp=&amp;amp;dates=&amp;amp;lg=&amp;amp;language=en&amp;amp;jur=C%2CT%2CF&amp;amp;cit=none%252CC%252CCJ%252CR%252C2008E%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252Ctrue%252Cfalse%252Cfalse&amp;amp;td=%3BALL&amp;amp;pcs=Oor&amp;amp;avg=&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;mat=or&amp;amp;parties=grzelczyk&amp;amp;jge=&amp;amp;for=&amp;amp;cid=489189" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>Bidar&lt;/a>&lt;/em> regarding students&amp;rsquo; access to welfare benefits in their host states. Decisional practices of the EFTA Surveillance Authority suggest similar rights for students in the EEA. A similar interpretation might be inferred from the EFTA Court&amp;rsquo;s opinion in &lt;em>Jabbi&lt;/em>, specifically paragraph 51. However, &lt;em>Jabbi&lt;/em> notably reflects a renewed effort by the EFTA Court to temper its decision&amp;rsquo;s influence on national welfare systems and to explicitly acknowledge the distinctions between the two legal frameworks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In paragraphs 78 and 82 of the Advisory Opinion, the EFTA Court suggests applying Article 7(1)(b) of the citizens&amp;rsquo; Directive by analogy to the situation of a returning citizen. It argues that a derived right hinges on fulfilling the conditions outlined in this Article (in addition to other criteria established in CJEU case law on Union citizenship, such as &amp;ldquo;genuine stay&amp;rdquo; and length of stay, for the Union citizen to be considered in a cross-border situation). One possible interpretation of these statements is the potential for maintaining national family reunification requirements, specifically regarding the sponsor&amp;rsquo;s financial resources. This interpretation stems from the Court&amp;rsquo;s repeated emphasis on conditioning family reunification in the home state upon meeting the criteria of Article 7(1)(b), even after returning from another EEA state (see paragraphs 80 and 82).  &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Given this interpretation, it is debatable whether Mr. Jabbi&amp;rsquo;s rights under EEA law offer any concrete benefit. His right to family reunification ultimately depends on the sponsor satisfying the conditions of sufficient resources and health insurance stipulated in Article 7(1)(b) of the Citizens’ Directive. These conditions aim to prevent undue burdens on national welfare systems. Here, the EFTA Court seems to defer to national conditions in Norwegian immigration law, which links family reunification to specific financial resource requirements. Another potential consequence of this interpretation is that both static citizens and returning non-economically active citizens might be treated similarly under domestic legislation. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>The CJEU&amp;rsquo;s case law on Union citizenship has consistently aimed to secure effective rights for Union citizens and eliminate discrepancies between economically active and inactive individuals. However, recent restrictive CJEU case law concerning host state obligations based on Union citizenship, such as C-333/13 &lt;em>&lt;a class="link" href="http://eulawanalysis.blogspot.co.uk/2014/11/benefit-tourism-by-eu-citizens-cjeu.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Dano&lt;/a>&lt;/em>, C-67/14 &lt;em>&lt;a class="link" href="http://eulawanalysis.blogspot.co.uk/2015/09/eu-citizens-access-to-benefits-cjeu.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Alimanovic&lt;/a>&lt;/em>, and the recent case restricting the export of child care benefits from the UK, C-308/14 (discussed &lt;a class="link" href="http://eulawanalysis.blogspot.co.uk/2016/06/dont-think-of-children-cjeu-approves.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here&lt;/a>), should be acknowledged. The EFTA Court&amp;rsquo;s opinion in &lt;em>Jabbi&lt;/em> may align with this recent case law by exhibiting deference in its decisions that impact domestic welfare systems. However, the &lt;em>Jabbi&lt;/em> case does not reflect the essence of Union citizenship case law, particularly the home state obligations established in recent CJEU rulings on student rights. On the contrary, while striving for uniformity, the EFTA Court appears more hesitant, even highlighting potential disparities between the two legal orders due to inherent differences in their legal frameworks. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>EU/EFTA institutions appear consistently committed to harmonizing free movement rights within the EEA with those of the EU. The fundamental difference, however, lies in the nature of the provisions on free movement of people in the EEA Agreement compared to their EU counterparts. This was highlighted in the &lt;em>Wahl&lt;/em> case (paragraph 75), but the &lt;em>Jabbi&lt;/em> case represents the first time the EFTA Court elaborates on these distinctions (particularly in paragraph 62). Free movement within the EEA primarily centers around the economic objective of the single market, granting rights to economically active individuals. Beyond this group, rights are restricted. There is neither Union citizenship nor the overarching aim of an &amp;ldquo;ever closer Union.&amp;rdquo; Furthermore, rights of non-EU citizens are generally outside the Agreement&amp;rsquo;s purview. Additionally, institutional practice within the EEA is contingent on decisions made by the Contracting Parties within the EEA Joint Committee. Therefore, free movement of people under the EEA diverges from the EU framework. Whether these distinctions are significant enough to impact future association agreements between the UK and the EU remains to be seen.&lt;/p>

This particular Beogram 4002 (5513) had deep scratches on its hood.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The restoration started by sanding with 220-grit sandpaper, then progressively moved to finer grits (320-grit shown). This process, which took about 3 hours and involved around 10 polishing steps with Micro-Mesh up to 12000 level, returned the hood to a translucent and shiny condition.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The rubber bumpers on the hood corners had deteriorated, leaving only embedded remnants. These remnants were drilled out using a 2mm drill bit. New bumpers were fashioned from sections of a 2mm O-ring, secured with super glue gel, and trimmed to a 1mm length for proper hood alignment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the hood restored, this Beogram 4002 is well on its way to looking its best again!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>You Are Definitely Going to Need More Bandwidth</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/you-are-definitely-going-to-need-more-bandwidth/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jun 2024 19:05:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/you-are-definitely-going-to-need-more-bandwidth/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>By: John Shepler&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Suddenly, the typical workplace is no more. The usual routines of office life have vanished. Employees are no longer commuting to their desks. Cubicles and parking lots are deserted. Countless desktop computers and phones sit idle.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/a>&lt;strong>The New Normal: Where is Everyone?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A small team remains onsite, but the majority of employees are working from home. There&amp;rsquo;s been a massive effort to establish remote connections using personal computers, iPads, and smartphones, relying on cable and cellular broadband. Consequently, bandwidth usage has surged by 30% or more. Video conferencing has become indispensable, with platforms like Skype, Zoom, FaceTime, RingCentral, GoToMeeting, and Webex taking center stage, utilizing built-in microphones and cameras.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>This is Not a Temporary Situation&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s tempting to believe that this disruption to our work lives is temporary. That in a few short weeks, things will return to normal. This is likely wishful thinking. While the pandemic might be peaking or has peaked in areas hit early and hard, it&amp;rsquo;s far from over. The crisis will continue to unfold in other regions that were not initially affected and have only recently implemented lockdowns. It will be like a rolling disaster, moving from city to city, even reaching less populated regions. Just as we start to feel like it&amp;rsquo;s behind us, a resurgence of infections is predicted for the fall.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Effective treatments and vaccines are anticipated, but they are likely months, if not a year or more, away. While the situation may not remain a constant crisis, it&amp;rsquo;s safe to say that it won&amp;rsquo;t be business as usual for a while. We must adapt and discover how to maintain successful businesses without large groups of people in a single workspace or close contact between employees and clients.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Essential Tools for the Virtual Business&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mastering distributed processes, secure communications, and remote operations is critical. VPNs will be crucial for security, while private and public cloud services will host the software that drives businesses. Robust bandwidth will connect it all together. &amp;ldquo;Touchless&amp;rdquo; interactions will be the new standard, with technology replacing hands-on activities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What kind of bandwidth will be necessary? Basic home broadband won&amp;rsquo;t suffice. Remote employees may not have access to the high-performance business-grade private lines often used in offices. They will, however, require dependable bandwidth for video conferencing with coworkers, management, and customers, ensuring that home computers function as seamlessly as their office counterparts. While cable broadband might be adequate in some instances, remote areas may require an SD-WAN solution that combines cable, T1, WISP, 4G and 5G cellular, and even satellite connectivity for a comprehensive solution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Bandwidth-Intensive Industries&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Medical facilities, labs, and hospitals demand high-performance bandwidth solutions such as Gigabit Ethernet, 10 GigE fiber, dark fiber, and MPLS networks. These connections are crucial for linking distant facilities or collaborating organizations. While readily available in densely populated areas, these solutions pose a greater challenge in rural locations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>IT Bandwidth Requirements: Re-evaluated&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The need for IT department connectivity has changed. High-performance, dedicated bandwidth connections to public, private, and hybrid cloud services will be essential. These connections offer faster, more responsive, and stable experiences than standard internet connections, providing a &amp;ldquo;LAN-like&amp;rdquo; quality from any business location. Dedicated point-to-point fiber optic lines, Metro Ethernet services, and MPLS networks that span large geographical regions, including global coverage, can achieve this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Aftermath&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While this crisis will eventually pass, things may never return to the way they were. Businesses may find themselves surprised by the productivity of their remote workforce, even with the presence of children and pets. The truth is that those cubicles often saw a lot of socializing, personal internet use, and non-work-related emails. Allowing a large portion of employees to work remotely eliminates their commute and, potentially, childcare costs. It also reduces the need for physical office space. As a result, performance management may shift from monitoring physical presence to focusing on goal-oriented outcomes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can expect a significant increase in remote work, with core teams potentially operating from smaller facilities or shared workspaces. Video conferencing may replace many business trips once considered essential. It&amp;rsquo;s possible to achieve the same, if not higher, levels of productivity at a reduced cost while increasing flexibility. Moreover, securing additional help could become faster and more cost-effective without the need for relocation.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Professor Steve Peers*&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a recent speech outlining the UK&amp;rsquo;s post-Brexit plans, Prime Minister Theresa May&amp;rsquo;s approach resembled Machiavelli&amp;rsquo;s strategies more than Leonardo da Vinci&amp;rsquo;s artistry. Nonetheless, her speech provided a glimpse into the legal structure the UK government envisions for its relationship with the EU during a transitional period after Brexit. While the main points of the Florence speech have been previously discussed, this piece delves deeper into the legal framework and its implications for EU27 citizens in the UK during this transition.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Legal framework&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A key question arises: is a transitional period after Brexit legally feasible? If so, which EU laws would govern it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Article 50 TEU, outlining the rules for Member State withdrawal, doesn&amp;rsquo;t mention a transitional period. However, Article 49 TEU, addressing accession, similarly omits transitional periods for joining the EU, yet such periods are standard practice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The European Council, representing EU27 leaders, indicated a willingness to explore transitional arrangements in their Brexit negotiation guidelines. These arrangements must be well-defined, time-limited, and enforceable. They suggest that any extension of existing EU laws would necessitate the continued application of current regulatory, budgetary, supervisory, judicial, and enforcement mechanisms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These principles are reiterated in the negotiation directives from the Council to the European Commission. Further directives are expected once &amp;ldquo;sufficient progress&amp;rdquo; is made on key issues like citizens&amp;rsquo; rights, finances, and Northern Ireland.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>May&amp;rsquo;s speech proposed that the UK would withdraw from EU political institutions on Brexit Day, with a &amp;ldquo;strictly time-limited&amp;rdquo; transition period of approximately two years. Aspects like a new dispute settlement system could be expedited, implying continued ECJ jurisdiction until then.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During this transition, market access would remain unchanged, the UK would participate in existing security measures, and the current EU rules and regulations would form the framework. Financial obligations would continue until the 2020 funding cycle ends.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>EU citizens&amp;rsquo; right to live and work in the UK would continue, albeit with mandatory registration, a provision permitted under the EU citizens&amp;rsquo; Directive. However, the UK would conduct its own trade negotiations, forgoing the benefits of EU negotiations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>May also addressed maintaining EU27 citizens&amp;rsquo; rights, potentially relevant to transition issues. She committed to integrating the agreement into UK law, allowing UK courts direct referral and consideration of ECJ case law.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Both sides broadly agree on a time-limited transitional period bridging the present and future UK/EU relationship. Defining the future relationship isn&amp;rsquo;t mandatory within the withdrawal agreement, as Article 50 only requires a &amp;ldquo;framework.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Challenges may arise concerning post-Brexit EU legislation and EU law&amp;rsquo;s legal effect. Currently, the European Communities Act integrates new EU law into UK law, granting it direct effect and supremacy, and recognizing ECJ rulings. However, the proposed EU Withdrawal Bill would replace these provisions, retaining pre-Brexit EU rules and ECJ judgments, allowing amendments by the UK government or Parliament. It would also remove the principle of damages liability for breaching EU law and exclude the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights from retained EU law.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Technically, the UK government can incorporate any Withdrawal Agreement provision into UK law due to the broad amending powers granted by the Withdrawal Bill. Therefore, the issue isn&amp;rsquo;t capability but willingness to negotiate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While the Prime Minister avoided confirming the application of post-Brexit EU law during the transition, deeming it negotiable, Cabinet members have opposed it. The EU27&amp;rsquo;s stance remains flexible on this point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Less flexibility exists regarding EU law&amp;rsquo;s legal effect. The EU27 advocates for the continued application of &amp;ldquo;existing EU regulatory, budgetary, supervisory, judiciary and enforcement instruments and structures,&amp;rdquo; suggesting the ECJ&amp;rsquo;s ongoing jurisdiction and EU law&amp;rsquo;s current legal effect in the UK. While May alluded to the ECJ, she expressed a desire for an early termination of its role. Extending the UK&amp;rsquo;s stance on EU27 citizens&amp;rsquo; rights (no ECJ role, optional consideration of ECJ rulings, incorporation of the Withdrawal Agreement without special status) to transitional rules would fall short of the EU27&amp;rsquo;s position. Additionally, the EU27 might advocate for the EU Charter&amp;rsquo;s continued application during the transition, particularly when implementing EU law.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Three additional points warrant consideration. First, the status of non-EU countries concerning the UK during the transition needs clarification, considering treaties involving the EU alone or the EU and its Member States.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Second, the post-transition period requires planning, particularly if extending the arrangement is deemed desirable. The Article 50 decision-making rule would expire, requiring adherence to standard EU law procedures. Depending on the content, unanimous voting and ratification by all Member States might be necessary, although provisional treaty application pending national ratification is an option.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, a fundamental question remains: can a transitional deal be incorporated into Article 50? The EU27&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;legally possible&amp;rdquo; wording suggests potential doubts, possibly arguing that Article 50 cannot govern post-Brexit legal relationships but only regulate existing ones. However, this interpretation appears narrow, given Article 50&amp;rsquo;s reference to the framework for future relations and Article 8 TEU&amp;rsquo;s emphasis on strong relationships with neighboring non-EU countries. A time-limited transitional deal linked to the future framework should be legally sound. Notably, Article 50 doesn&amp;rsquo;t mandate ECJ jurisdiction over the withdrawal agreement beyond the general rule of ECJ&amp;rsquo;s authority on interpreting EU law for Member States.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is crucial as the Article 50 agreement requires only a qualified majority vote from the EU27, bypassing national ratification. However, a &amp;ldquo;Plan B&amp;rdquo; is necessary should a legal challenge arise. In such a scenario, the ECJ might temporarily uphold contested treaty elements based on legal certainty, prompting the UK and EU to agree upon and provisionally apply the disputed parts based on appropriate legal grounds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Extension of the Article 50 period&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Extending the negotiation period, as permitted by Article 50, has been suggested as an alternative to a transition phase. Legally, this requires only a unanimous vote from the EU27 and the UK government, without European Parliament involvement. Domestically, an Act of Parliament might be required.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Politically, however, extending negotiations would be challenging. Unanimous EU27 consent is uncertain, especially considering the UK&amp;rsquo;s potential participation in the 2019 European Parliament elections. In the UK, a Brexit delay could weaken May&amp;rsquo;s political standing and bolster support for figures like Nigel Farage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Moreover, equating negotiation extension with a transition period is misleading. First, during an extension, the UK would remain involved in EU political institutions. Second, an extension guarantees the unchanged application of EU law in the UK, including new legislation and ECJ judgments, while these aspects might be addressed differently during a transition.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Third, if the UK reconsiders Brexit, remaining within the EU through negotiation extension differs from rejoining after leaving. This hinges on resolving legal uncertainties surrounding Article 50 (withdrawal notice revocation, EU consent, potential conditions, indefinite extension) and the terms of potential rejoining (existing opt-outs, budget rebates).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>EU27 citizens&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The UK government&amp;rsquo;s plan to register EU citizens during the transition aligns with the EU citizens&amp;rsquo; Directive, allowing registration for stays exceeding three months. However, penalties for non-registration must be proportionate, excluding expulsion or detention. Member States can maintain databases on EU citizens solely for administering EU free movement law. Information in criminal databases necessitates treating EU citizens equally to nationals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Registration certificates cannot be the only proof of residency or other rights, and penalties for not carrying them are allowed only if applied to nationals lacking ID cards. Consequently, lacking an ID card system, the UK cannot penalize EU citizens for not carrying registration certificates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While EU citizen registration is permissible, the legislation and case law limitations raise broader &amp;ldquo;transition law&amp;rdquo; questions. Demanding a complete ban on registration by the UK would be unrealistic, given similar practices in other EU states. However, will these limitations be upheld? This is crucial considering the UK Home Office&amp;rsquo;s history of creating a &amp;ldquo;hostile environment&amp;rdquo; for both EU and non-EU citizens. Without EU law and case law safeguards, unregistered EU citizens or those lacking certificates could face fines, detention, expulsion, or rights infringements. (These concerns also extend to potentially applying registration requirements to EU citizens present before Brexit Day.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Continued application of existing EU law and pre-Brexit ECJ case law, as agreed upon, would resolve the issue during the transition. However, uncertainties remain regarding potential UK breaches, implementation inconsistencies, or new ECJ case law. Key questions arise about the availability of existing EU law remedies, UK courts&amp;rsquo; ability to consult the ECJ, and their obligation to follow post-Brexit ECJ case law.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While significant for EU citizens in the UK, this issue represents a small part of the legal complexities surrounding the transition period. It&amp;rsquo;s crucial for both the UK and EU27 to thoroughly address these complexities in due course.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Marcin Kotula&lt;/strong>, Legal Officer at the European Commission&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The opinions presented are solely those of the author and should not be interpreted as representing the European Commission&amp;rsquo;s official stance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Background&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;em>Breyer&lt;/em> case saw the German Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) request clarification from the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on whether dynamic IP addresses constitute personal data under the &lt;a class="link" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1479310045045&amp;amp;uri=CELEX:31995L0046" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>EU Data Protection Directive&lt;/a> and to what extent their storage and processing is permissible for maintaining website functionality. The case involved &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.patrick-breyer.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Mr Breyer&lt;/a>, a German politician and privacy advocate, who accessed various German federal institution websites. During his visits, information about visitor IP addresses (specifically, the devices used) was recorded in log files, alongside details such as accessed pages, search queries, access times, and data transferred.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Storing this data aimed to counter cyberattacks and facilitate the prosecution of perpetrators. Mr. Breyer opposed the storage of his IP address after accessing these sites. His legal challenge, requesting the German government halt this practice, ultimately reached the German Supreme Court, which then sought guidance from the CJEU.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The German Supreme Court&amp;rsquo;s questions centered on dynamic IP addresses, which, unlike static IP addresses, change with each internet connection, making them less privacy-invasive. Assigned by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) as a series of digits, IP addresses alone don&amp;rsquo;t directly identify individuals. However, when combined with additional information held by ISPs, they can be used to identify the owner of an internet-connected device. A 2011 CJEU ruling, the &lt;em>&lt;a class="link" href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;amp;docid=115202&amp;amp;pageIndex=0&amp;amp;doclang=EN&amp;amp;mode=lst&amp;amp;dir=&amp;amp;occ=first&amp;amp;part=1&amp;amp;cid=1062987" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Scarlet Extended&lt;/a>&lt;/em> judgment, determined that ISPs handle IP addresses as personal data. However, the &lt;em>Breyer&lt;/em> case differed: the German federal institutions operating the websites only possessed the IP addresses, while the identifying information was held by the ISPs. The CJEU was tasked with determining whether these institutions, acting as data controllers, should treat IP addresses as personal data despite lacking this additional information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The CJEU&amp;rsquo;s analysis&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In its &lt;a class="link" href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?docid=184668&amp;amp;doclang=EN&amp;amp;cid=1095511" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>judgment&lt;/a> issued on October 19, 2016, the CJEU referenced Article 2(a) of the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC, defining personal data as any information relating to an identifiable individual, directly or indirectly. Therefore, even if information doesn&amp;rsquo;t explicitly identify a person, it can still be classified as personal data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recital 26 of the Directive offers further guidance on determining identifiability, stating that all reasonably likely means employed by the data controller or any other party to identify the individual should be considered. Based on this, the CJEU assessed the likelihood of the German federal institutions combining the IP addresses they held with the additional information held by ISPs. Aligning with the &lt;a class="link" href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;amp;docid=178241&amp;amp;pageIndex=0&amp;amp;doclang=EN&amp;amp;mode=lst&amp;amp;dir=&amp;amp;occ=first&amp;amp;part=1&amp;amp;cid=600292" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Opinion of the Advocate General&lt;/a>  (AG), the CJEU determined this combination was unlikely if prohibited by law or excessively challenging in terms of time, cost, and resources. Within the German context, direct transmission of such information from ISPs to website providers is prohibited. However, in cases of cyberattacks, website providers can contact relevant authorities, who can then obtain the additional information from ISPs. This legal channel led the CJEU to conclude that the German federal institutions must treat the IP addresses of their website visitors as personal data, as identification is possible through collaboration with competent authorities and ISPs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The CJEU then examined if storing and processing IP addresses post-visit for website operability purposes was permissible for the German federal institutions. Relevant provisions within the German Law on telemedia (Telemediengesetz - TMG) allow user data collection and processing solely for facilitating and billing specific online service use, seemingly excluding general website operability. The CJEU was asked to clarify if these German provisions aligned with Article 7(f) of the Data Protection Directive, which permits personal data processing necessary for the legitimate interests of the data controller or third parties receiving the data, unless overridden by the data subject&amp;rsquo;s fundamental rights and freedoms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As maintaining website operability and preventing cyberattacks could lead to criminal proceedings against perpetrators, the CJEU considered if processing IP addresses in such scenarios falls outside the Directive&amp;rsquo;s scope entirely. Examining Article 3(2) first indent, which excludes personal data processing within the framework of State criminal law activities, the CJEU concluded that in this scenario, the German federal institutions weren&amp;rsquo;t acting as State authorities but rather as individuals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Regarding Article 7(f), the CJEU referred to its &lt;a class="link" href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;amp;docid=115205&amp;amp;pageIndex=0&amp;amp;doclang=EN&amp;amp;mode=lst&amp;amp;dir=&amp;amp;occ=first&amp;amp;part=1&amp;amp;cid=677507" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>2011 &lt;em>ASNEF&lt;/em> judgment&lt;/a>, which recognizes the legal bases for personal data processing outlined in Article 7 as exhaustive. Member States cannot introduce new principles or additional requirements in this regard. Article 5 of the Directive allows Member States to specify the conditions for lawful processing, but this must remain within Article 7&amp;rsquo;s boundaries and the Directive&amp;rsquo;s objective of balancing the free movement of personal data with privacy protection.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Based on this, the CJEU found that the German provisions, by prohibiting processing for general website operability, exceeded mere specification of lawful conditions. The CJEU asserted that these provisions should allow for balancing the goal of website operability against the fundamental rights and freedoms of users. This balancing typically occurs on a case-by-case basis. However, the German provisions preemptively dictate the outcome of this balancing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The CJEU&amp;rsquo;s judgment aligns with established case-law on the Data Protection Directive, which leans towards broad interpretations of key concepts like &amp;lsquo;personal data&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;processing.&amp;rsquo; This interpretation also aligns with the &lt;a class="link" href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/index_en.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Article 29 Data Protection Working Party&lt;/a>, which, &lt;a class="link" href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2007/wp136_en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>in its 2007 Opinion&lt;/a>, considers IP addresses as personal data, with the sole exception of addresses assigned in environments like cybercafés where users are typically anonymous.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The CJEU&amp;rsquo;s response regarding IP address processing for website operability leaves room for interpretation. It acknowledges ensuring website functionality as a legitimate aim for German federal institutions under Article 7(f) of the Data Protection Directive. However, it emphasizes the need to weigh such aims against data subjects&amp;rsquo; fundamental rights and freedoms. Therefore, retaining IP addresses without further consideration might not always be permissible for website providers. Instead, they might need to balance competing interests on a case-by-case basis. The CJEU refrains from specifying criteria for this assessment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The AG&amp;rsquo;s Opinion offered a noteworthy suggestion. Analyzing Recital 26&amp;rsquo;s wording, which mandates considering means employed by both the data controller and &amp;ldquo;any other person&amp;rdquo; to assess identifiability, the AG proposes interpreting &amp;ldquo;any other person&amp;rdquo; as specific third parties accessible to and reasonably approachable by the data controller for additional information. The CJEU didn&amp;rsquo;t explicitly address this in its judgment. However, by focusing solely on the scenario where German federal institutions collaborate with authorities responsible for prosecuting cyberattacks, who then contact ISPs for additional information, the Court remained within the AG&amp;rsquo;s suggestion, as these third parties were either directly or indirectly accessible. It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that the German court&amp;rsquo;s question specifically mentioned ISPs as the source of additional information, without exploring other scenarios.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another significant point arose during the CJEU&amp;rsquo;s analysis of whether IP address processing qualifies as a State activity within criminal law, potentially exempting it from the Data Protection Directive. Both the CJEU and AG dismissed this exemption&amp;rsquo;s applicability, as the German federal institutions weren&amp;rsquo;t acting in their public authority capacity while processing IP addresses. Instead, they acted as &amp;ldquo;individuals.&amp;rdquo; However, the term &amp;ldquo;individual&amp;rdquo; is often synonymous with &amp;ldquo;natural person,&amp;rdquo; as seen in data protection instruments like the Data Protection Directive 95/46, &lt;a class="link" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1479743650879&amp;amp;uri=CELEX:32001R0045" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Regulation 45/2001&lt;/a>, and &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/rms/0900001680078b37" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Convention No. 108 of the Council of Europe&lt;/a>, which all refer to protecting &amp;ldquo;individuals&amp;rdquo; in relation to personal data processing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This distinction is relevant to another exception within the Data Protection Directive: processing by natural persons for purely personal or household activities. While seemingly counterintuitive for a public authority to invoke an exception intended for natural persons, it might not be implausible considering CJEU case-law. Of the three CJEU cases addressing this exception, two (&lt;a class="link" href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;amp;docid=160561&amp;amp;pageIndex=0&amp;amp;doclang=EN&amp;amp;mode=lst&amp;amp;dir=&amp;amp;occ=first&amp;amp;part=1&amp;amp;cid=214787" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>_Rynes&lt;/a>_, &lt;em>&lt;a class="link" href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;amp;docid=48382&amp;amp;pageIndex=0&amp;amp;doclang=EN&amp;amp;mode=lst&amp;amp;dir=&amp;amp;occ=first&amp;amp;part=1&amp;amp;cid=214787" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Lindqvist&lt;/a>&lt;/em>) involved natural persons processing data. However, the &lt;a class="link" href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;amp;docid=76075&amp;amp;pageIndex=0&amp;amp;doclang=EN&amp;amp;mode=lst&amp;amp;dir=&amp;amp;occ=first&amp;amp;part=1&amp;amp;cid=214787" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;em>Satamedia&lt;/em> case&lt;/a> concerned processing by a private company.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In &lt;em>Satamedia&lt;/em>, the CJEU ruled that Satamedia and Markkinapörssi, as private companies, couldn&amp;rsquo;t rely on the State activities in criminal law exception. However, the court then examined whether their processing qualified as a purely personal or household activity, ultimately rejecting this possibility due to the companies making collected data publicly available. Considering the CJEU and AG&amp;rsquo;s assertion in &lt;em>Breyer&lt;/em> that the German federal institutions processed IP addresses as individuals, and the CJEU not ruling out this option for private companies, it seems conceivable for a public authority to invoke the personal and household exemption. However, this exemption&amp;rsquo;s requirements are stringent. In all three CJEU cases mentioned, the exemption was rejected due to data being published online, made widely accessible, or falling outside the collector&amp;rsquo;s private sphere (e.g., public space video surveillance).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lastly, the &lt;em>Breyer&lt;/em> case closely mirrors personal data pseudonymization, a concept introduced in the new &lt;a class="link" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&amp;amp;from=ENhttp://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&amp;amp;from=EN" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>General Data Protection Regulation&lt;/a> (GDPR) applicable from May 25, 2018. Pseudonymization is defined as processing personal data to prevent attribution to a specific data subject without additional information, which is stored separately and subject to technical and organizational measures to prevent re-identification. Under GDPR, pseudonymized data is still considered personal data, but pseudonymization is factored into the application of certain provisions.&lt;/p>

However, local storage is still necessary. While Storage Attached Networks (SANs) are a common solution, they&amp;rsquo;re expensive and complex. A simpler option exists.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://www.CloudNetworkingServices.com/images/HardDriveOpen250.jpg"
loading="lazy"
alt="Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about individual drive failures when you have a Drobo."
>Introducing Drobo, an advanced hard disk storage solution that&amp;rsquo;s surprisingly easy to use. It works with standard 3.5&amp;quot; SATA drives of any capacity, resembling a straightforward multi-bay drive enclosure. Adding or removing drives, even swapping a 1 TB for a 2 TB, is always possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You might think this flexibility requires complicated administration, but it&amp;rsquo;s truly plug and play. No need for arcane command lines or admin panels – everything&amp;rsquo;s automated and user-friendly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Essentially, you&amp;rsquo;re building your own private storage cloud on-site. This eliminates bandwidth concerns for real-time data access, as the unit sits on your network.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;re likely familiar with RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Drives), which safeguards data against drive failures. Drobo goes further with &amp;ldquo;BeyondRAID.&amp;rdquo; Unlike RAID, it accommodates drives of varying sizes. Connect any six SATA drives to a Drobo, and the system automatically configures redundant storage, creating a combined storage pool without limitations from the smallest disk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This aligns with the cloud philosophy – you don&amp;rsquo;t worry about the technical details. Need more space? Add a drive. Bays full? Swap a smaller drive for a larger one. The system adapts, providing extra capacity without data loss.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Upgrading is also effortless. Transitioning from a 9-bay to a 12-bay system (up to 24 TB) involves moving drives to the new unit. Don&amp;rsquo;t remember the order? No problem. Plug them in anywhere, add new ones, and you&amp;rsquo;re set. Status lights turn green when the system is ready.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sound too good to be true? Explore their materials and watch the demo videos. Drobo units begin at four bays for small offices, scaling upwards to meet your needs.&lt;/p>

They were puzzled by the activity in a particular account from January to March, seeing only a $100 credit in January, a $50 debit in February, and a $200 credit in March. They wondered why each month didn&amp;rsquo;t show both debits and credits.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It took me a moment to realize that, unlike my usual practice of migrating both debit and credit activity for complete GL history, someone else had migrated only the net change for each period from their old system. This was likely because their previous system made it difficult to download detailed period activity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This situation reminded me how important it is to migrate both debits and credits for clarity, especially for new users looking back at historical data. Plus, it usually doesn&amp;rsquo;t take any extra time if the data is accessible. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in hearing your approaches to GL history migration – how do you handle these situations?&lt;/p>

The keypad is now responsive, but the cueing up and down button is overly sensitive and needs further attention.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The RPM panel re-installation was put on hold because the plastic mounting fixtures were cracked, a common issue with Beogram 4002 turntables. I was fortunate that the cracks weren&amp;rsquo;t severe and the fixtures were still usable. To repair them, I used acrylic repair fluid while pressing the pieces together. Since this fix alone isn&amp;rsquo;t durable enough for frequent removal and re-installation, I reinforced it with Dura-Lar strips and epoxy on both sides of each mounting block.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The repaired mounting blocks attach to the aluminum frame with set screws located underneath. It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that the mounting screw for both the keypad and the RPM indicator panel sits directly below the RPM panel. This means the panel must be removed to access the keypad buttons or phono output board, highlighting the necessity of reinforcing the mounting blocks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, I focused on verifying the voltages and signals from the Beogram&amp;rsquo;s detectors. The first check was the 4D1 LED and 4IC1 optical sensor, which detect the tangential arm&amp;rsquo;s position. The sensor reacts to light changes as the arm moves along the acrylic slide.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following the service manual, I measured the voltage at the collector of the 4IC1 sensor with a transparent section of the slide between the LED and sensor. The voltage should be around 5V, and if not, adjusted using the 1R88 trimmer on the main board.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This adjustment is crucial because the run-out groove detection at the end of a record relies on a correctly set voltage level.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, I examined the fixed arm sensor, responsible for detecting the presence of a record and determining if it&amp;rsquo;s safe to lower the tonearm. The fixed arm has a light source directed at the platter, and an optical sensor reads the reflected light. A consistent, dim light signal, indicating a record is present, allows the stylus to be lowered. Without a record, the platter&amp;rsquo;s black ribs interrupt the reflected light, creating pulses that prevent the stylus from lowering.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This sensor&amp;rsquo;s signal needs to function correctly and at the appropriate level.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The sensor is producing pulses exceeding the required 6 volts, ensuring the tonearm won&amp;rsquo;t lower onto an empty platter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before checking the end groove and run-out stop circuit, I wanted to complete some mechanical checks and adjustments to prepare the Beogram for playback. I was pleased to find the platter-to-tonearm height was already at the required 23mm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The arm lowering limit needed setting to ensure the stylus tip is approximately 1mm from the top of the first platter rib. This safety measure safeguards the cartridge from damage if the record detection circuit fails.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another mechanical adjustment involved checking the tonearm&amp;rsquo;s length and parallelism. By running a string tangent to the Beogram arm assembly, I could visually confirm the stylus followed the string&amp;rsquo;s path.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had previously confirmed the 7.7mm distance and parallelism between the tonearm and fixed arm when disassembling and cleaning the tonearm assembly earlier in the restoration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With those steps completed, record playback is getting closer. The remaining tasks include fine-tuning the tracking sensor sensitivity, verifying the run-off stop function, and calibrating the platter speeds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Adjusting the tracking sensor was relatively smooth, though it involved several iterations to achieve the desired sensitivity where the tangential arm motor moves after the correct number of revolutions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The run-off stop check on the oscilloscope showed good results. I successfully adjusted trimmers 1R14 and 1R15 on the main board to set the 33⅓ RPM and 45 RPM speeds using the Beolover RPM tool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These Beograms require a lot of adjustments and checks, but their exceptional design makes them well worth the effort.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, it&amp;rsquo;s time for a break with food and fireworks – away from the Beogram, of course. Afterward, I&amp;rsquo;ll make a quick adjustment to the keypad cueing button, and then it&amp;rsquo;s time to relax and enjoy some vinyl.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Divergence in regulations after Brexit: Copyright law as a preview of future changes.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/divergence-in-regulations-after-brexit-copyright-law-as-a-preview-of-future-changes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jun 2024 18:21:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/divergence-in-regulations-after-brexit-copyright-law-as-a-preview-of-future-changes/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjkzyTh4sCqBpQPQjKlVAIh-zQ5YCkhZpnEie1Db6Plh3Mxd6BoTfMXIreX1YOHiyNwYEwDryZX3SMfp7121toAaYG8DMEBnHUKvWP_aWCCn2sDovs5c3qrBFf5wQnfQlhmz8l6oo05PTQ/s1600/wiki&amp;#43;memes.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Martin Kretschmer&lt;/strong>, Professor of Intellectual Property Law (CREATe Centre, University of Glasgow)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The UK&amp;rsquo;s departure from the European Union has resulted in the first instance of regulatory divergence. As the UK exits the single market, existing regulations are starting to show cracks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In response to a question from MP Jo Stevens, former Intellectual Property Minister Chris Skidmore indicated the UK would not implement the latest EU Copyright Directive, despite the UK&amp;rsquo;s prior support for it in the EU Council. This decision is significant, as the Directive passed with a narrow margin and might not have succeeded without the UK&amp;rsquo;s backing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While public discourse has centered on regulations concerning labor, environment, and taxes, Brexit proponents have consistently argued that the UK&amp;rsquo;s exit hinges on its ability to become a more appealing hub for businesses. This entails engaging in regulatory competition with its closest trading partner, the EU. Therefore, observing the UK&amp;rsquo;s approach to this negotiation is crucial, with copyright law presenting the initial area of divergence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To illustrate, a parliamentary exchange on January 16, 2020, saw Jo Stevens inquire about the government&amp;rsquo;s plans for implementing the EU Copyright Directive into UK law. Chris Skidmore, the minister responsible for intellectual property, responded on January 21, 2020, stating that the UK, having exited the EU on January 31, 2020, and with no intention to extend the implementation period ending December 31, 2020, was not obligated to implement the Directive and had no plans to do so. He added that any future modifications to the UK&amp;rsquo;s copyright framework would be considered through standard domestic policy processes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, what future domestic policies might stray from the Directive&amp;rsquo;s objectives? The Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market encompasses three key areas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Firstly, it standardizes several copyright exceptions pertaining to cross-border use, simplifies the utilization of out-of-commerce works, and ensures works of visual art in the public domain remain accessible. These provisions moderately benefit cultural institutions, education, and research.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Secondly, the Directive aims to bolster the contractual standing of authors and performers. It establishes a fair remuneration principle, promotes transparency in royalty statements, and grants creators the right to revoke licenses or transfers of rights in cases of inadequate exploitation. These regulations, though potentially conflicting with freedom of contract principles, lack strong enforcement mechanisms. While welcomed by creators, their implementation remains unclear, with no obvious alternative policy direction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The third and most contentious group of measures, presented as &amp;ldquo;Measures to achieve a well-functioning marketplace for copyright,&amp;rdquo; focuses on the liability of platforms hosting user-generated content. Article 17 removes the &amp;ldquo;safe harbor&amp;rdquo; protection of the e-Commerce Directive for certain &amp;ldquo;online content sharing service providers.&amp;rdquo; This means platforms are no longer exempt from liability for illegal content if not removed &amp;ldquo;expeditiously&amp;rdquo; after notification.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The debate surrounding Article 17 was highly polarized. Proponents, particularly the music industry, saw it as a way to improve licensing agreements and revenue sharing with platforms like YouTube, effectively closing the &amp;ldquo;value gap&amp;rdquo; between European creators and US tech giants. Conversely, opponents criticized it as a &amp;ldquo;censorship law,&amp;rdquo; arguing it would lead to excessive use of upload filters and stifle creativity due to its impact on &amp;ldquo;memes&amp;rdquo; that repurpose copyrighted material.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This debate played out publicly in the Financial Times, with figures like Julia Reda and Michael Grade representing opposing viewpoints. Even Boris Johnson, then out of government, weighed in, criticizing the Directive on Twitter and calling it a move to benefit the powerful at the expense of the internet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Based on independent analyses, the Prime Minister&amp;rsquo;s assessment appears accurate. The Directive&amp;rsquo;s industrial policy measures risk unintended consequences beyond the music industry, potentially hindering market entry and user-driven innovation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This raises the question of whether the UK has had a change of heart and now prioritizes evidence-based policymaking for its creative industries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One possibility is that the UK acted strategically, supporting the Directive to potentially harm the EU&amp;rsquo;s digital single market. This suspicion stems from the strong criticism directed at the UK&amp;rsquo;s policy reversal. More likely, however, is that UK officials took a passive approach during copyright negotiations to avoid attention during a sensitive period surrounding the Withdrawal Agreement.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, this stance is unsustainable in the long term. Post-Brexit, the UK&amp;rsquo;s copyright regulations will be influenced by its new trade agreements, particularly with the EU and the US. Maintaining a safe harbor for content-sharing platforms could attract tech companies, but this might clash with the government&amp;rsquo;s existing agenda targeting major digital platforms, as seen in initiatives like the &amp;ldquo;duty of care&amp;rdquo; liability and the Digital Services Tax.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Past US trade agreements suggest a pattern of aggressive intellectual property stances, potentially impacting the UK&amp;rsquo;s freedom to regulate platforms independently. Therefore, as the UK navigates its post-Brexit future, evidence-based assessments of platform regulation will be crucial for fostering a thriving cultural and creative industry landscape. The AHRC-funded Creative Industries Policy &amp;amp; Evidence Centre (PEC) is already investigating the UK&amp;rsquo;s international competitiveness, with ongoing research mapping the regulatory environment for online platforms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In conclusion, the UK government&amp;rsquo;s legitimacy hinges on transparency and accountability. As it diverges from EU copyright law, it must clearly articulate the basis, goals, and intended outcomes of its regulatory decisions regarding platforms.

>&lt;/a> While large corporations often manage their own private networks, many businesses need reliable internet access without the high investment. These businesses require high-quality internet for e-commerce, customer communication, and connecting geographically dispersed locations. Dedicated Internet Access is a popular choice for businesses as it provides exclusive bandwidth, unlike shared bandwidth options like DSL or cable broadband, where speeds can vary depending on user activity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With DIA, businesses have a guaranteed bandwidth speed, such as 1.5 Mbps for T1 lines or 2.0 Mbps for E1 lines, for both uploads and downloads. Ethernet connections are gaining popularity as a scalable alternative to T1/E1 lines, offering speeds from 1 Mbps to 10 Gbps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>VPNs provide a secure way to utilize the internet by encrypting data and creating a &amp;ldquo;tunnel&amp;rdquo; for secure transmission. This is particularly useful for companies with multiple locations or employees working remotely. VPNs eliminate the need for costly dedicated lines, allowing businesses of all sizes to connect securely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are two common VPN methods: IPSec, which requires dedicated software, and SSL, which utilizes web browsers and is commonly used for secure online transactions.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Steve Peers&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is a fundamental principle of EU law, as taught to every student of the subject, that the Commission has a near-monopoly on proposing new EU legislation - it is the &amp;lsquo;motor&amp;rsquo; of EU integration. This near-monopoly is often called the Commission&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;right of initiative&amp;rsquo;. But does this right also imply a right to withdraw proposals? And if it does, are there any limitations to this power? These questions were addressed by the CJEU in a significant ruling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Background&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This case was about a proposed framework law governing ‘macro-financial assistance’ to countries outside the EU. This kind of assistance is intended to help non-EU countries facing serious financial difficulties, for example by helping them to meet upcoming loan repayments. Clearly, such assistance benefits the recipient countries&amp;rsquo; economies, which indirectly helps EU businesses that export to those countries. It also undoubtedly strengthens the political bonds between those countries and the EU.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Prior to the Treaty of Lisbon, such aid was provided under the EU’s ‘residual powers’, now covered by Article 352 TFEU. However, the Treaty established a specific legal basis for the EU to create rules on providing macroeconomic support to non-EU states: Article 212 TFEU, which allows for legislation to be passed through the ‘ordinary legislative procedure’. The Treaty of Lisbon also introduced Article 213 TFEU, which enables aid to be given in urgent cases, bypassing the full legislative process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 2011, the Commission put forward a proposal for a ‘framework law’ on macro-financial assistance. This law would have empowered the Commission to decide which countries outside the EU should receive funding. The Commission&amp;rsquo;s decisions on this matter would be subject to a form of oversight known as the ‘examination procedure&amp;rsquo;, a variant of the ‘comitology’ rules. This procedure grants expert committees from Member States the authority to block draft decisions made by the Commission. The European Parliament (EP) has no significant role in this process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Commission&amp;rsquo;s proposals did not satisfy the EP or the Council. The EP suggested that the Commission’s decisions on which countries receive macro-financial assistance should be subject to ‘delegated acts’. These are Commission decisions that can be vetoed by either the Council or the EP. The Council, on the other hand, believed that each decision to grant aid should be subject to the ordinary legislative procedure. Negotiations commenced between the two institutions, and they eventually agreed that the ordinary legislative procedure should be used for this purpose.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Commission fundamentally disagreed with this aspect of the EP/Council agreement, so it withdrew its proposal before any legislation could be passed. The Council reacted by taking the unusual step of suing the Commission. While ten Member States backed the Council&amp;rsquo;s decision, the EP – despite having a lot at stake – did not take sides.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The judgment&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Court&amp;rsquo;s judgment began by acknowledging that the Commission’s power to initiate legislation inherently includes the power to withdraw proposals. However, this power should not be seen as a ‘right of veto’ over the legislative process. Such an interpretation would undermine the principles of institutional balance and conferred powers. In essence, the Commission can withdraw proposals, but this power is not absolute.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The question then becomes: what are the limits to this power? The Court determined that the Commission must provide the EP and the Council with reasons for any withdrawals, backed up by “cogent evidence or arguments.” Decisions to withdraw should be open to legal challenges through actions for annulment. However, the Court deemed it sufficient for these reasons to be communicated to a Council working party and an EP/Council negotiation meeting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Concerning the substantive grounds for withdrawing its proposal, the CJEU concluded that the amendment desired by the EP and Council would have altered a fundamental element of the proposal. Furthermore, the amendment would have been at odds with the objective of streamlining EU policy in this area. The CJEU also ruled that the principle of democracy had not been violated because the Commission&amp;rsquo;s right of initiative inherently allows it to withdraw proposals as long as the Council hasn&amp;rsquo;t taken action. Consequently, the Commission did not violate the principles of conferral of powers and institutional balance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, the Court addressed a separate issue: whether the way in which the Commission withdrew its proposal violated the principle of ‘sincere cooperation’ among EU institutions. The Court decided that the Commission could not be faulted for withdrawing its proposal at a very late stage in the Council/EP negotiations. This was because it was only at that point that it became clear the co-legislators would insist on using the ordinary legislative procedure for approving each macro-financial assistance decision. Furthermore, the Commission had attempted to find common ground with the other institutions and had put forward compromises. The Court&amp;rsquo;s analysis implies that the EP’s position (delegated acts instead of a comitology process) would not have substantially changed the proposal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Firstly, what are the immediate implications of this judgment? The legislative process in this case failed, but the EU was still able to grant macro-financial assistance to non-EU states. In the absence of framework legislation on the matter, the EU has in practice been using individual legislative measures to assist each country – precisely what the Commission sought to avoid.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In principle, what is the correct procedure for such decisions? The CJEU seems to agree with the Commission&amp;rsquo;s view that efficiency is the most important factor. There are strong arguments for efficiency in the specific context of macro-financial assistance – payments often have to be made urgently and the non-EU country in question is often in dire straits. However, the Commission and the Court do not refer to this specific context, nor do they weigh the need for efficiency against the opposing need for full democratic oversight.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, one recent major recipient of EU macro-financial assistance has been Ukraine, and the EU’s relations with that country have been highly contentious. Ideally, there should be a full democratic debate about whether the EU should be supporting that country’s economy. This would allow those who sympathize with Putin’s Russia, or who have other reasons to criticize the Ukrainian government, to debate the merits of that assistance with those who support that government. Perhaps a good compromise would have been for the Commission to agree to make a full legislative proposal whenever a significant minority (say, a quarter of the Member States and/or a quarter of the MEPs) indicate a desire to debate the merits of giving macro-financial assistance to a particular third country.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Secondly, the broader consequences of this judgment relate to the relationship between the three main EU institutions. The judgment has procedural and substantive aspects. Procedurally, it appears quite easy for the Commission to justify withdrawing a proposal. It only needs to inform the EP/Council ‘trialogue’ (negotiation) meetings, or a Council working party, of its intention to do so. Here, the Court is essentially legitimizing these less formal aspects of EU governance. However, with respect, its approach is not persuasive. Since a legislative proposal affects the EP as well as the Council, simply informing a Council working party is not enough. In fact, even informing a trialogue committee is insufficient, as many MEPs and Member States are not represented there (the Council Presidency negotiates on behalf of all Member States represented in the Council).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>More broadly, the Commission should have to publicly justify its withdrawals to the general public. While it usually does this when withdrawing proposals as part of its work programme, the principle of openness (enshrined in the Treaties) suggests that this should be a legal requirement, applicable to every instance of withdrawal. The best practice would be for the Commission to adopt a formal decision for each withdrawal, publishing it in the EU’s Official Journal, thereby upholding the principle of active transparency.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is concerning that the Court views the EU system solely in terms of the institutions’ accountability to each other, rather than to the public. The Court&amp;rsquo;s dismissal of the ‘democratic principles’ argument is much too brief and fails to give that principle equal weight to – let alone greater weight than – the institutional rules outlined in the Treaty. A better approach would have been to interpret the Treaty’s silence on the withdrawal of Commission proposals in light of this democratic principle, emphasizing the vital role this principle gives to the EU institutions that have greater electoral legitimacy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, the Court does confirm that there needs to be judicial oversight of the withdrawal of Commission proposals. The use of the annulment procedure means that not only the Council but also the EP and individual Member States can sue the Commission for withdrawing a proposal. Other parties are likely to lack standing to do so, except in a limited number of cases where Article 263 TFEU allows them to challenge non-legislative acts. Challenging withdrawals through national courts seems impractical at first glance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What are the substantive limitations on the Commission&amp;rsquo;s withdrawal of proposals? The CJEU suggests that there might be additional limitations after the Council has ‘acted,’ presumably referring to the Council’s adoption of its first reading position. Only a minority of EU legislative proposals get past this first reading, and in practice, half of those have already been agreed upon by the EP and the Council by that stage. It remains unclear what additional limitations might then exist, beyond those outlined in the Treaty (for instance, amending a Commission proposal after the first reading is easier in some cases). The Court may also take a different approach to non-legislative measures, or to those subject to a special legislative procedure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, let’s focus on the most common scenario – the withdrawal of a proposal for a legislative act under the ordinary legislative procedure before the Council adopts its first reading position. The Court did not suggest that a change in the essential elements of a Commission proposal was the only valid reason for withdrawing it. The Commission can presumably still withdraw proposals on other relevant grounds, particularly the most common ones: when the proposal becomes obsolete, or when it has no chance of being adopted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the existence of judicial review means that the Commission&amp;rsquo;s judgment in this regard could be challenged. The Court might also have to clarify, in a future case, what constitutes a change in the “essential elements” of a proposal. This could arise, for example, when the EP and Council want to significantly broaden or narrow the proposal’s scope. There is no reason why the “essential elements” rule should apply only to cases where the objective is improving the efficiency of EU actions. There are many other potential objectives for EU action.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What other grounds for withdrawal exist? The judgment implies that the Commission cannot simply claim that it has changed its mind, otherwise, judicial review would serve no purpose. There must be valid reasons for the change of mind. Would a new Commission be sufficient justification? This is a pertinent issue considering the Juncker Commission recently withdrew a number of proposals (e.g., the ‘circular economy’ proposals). The reason given was that it had shifted its legislative priorities and wanted to completely restart the process. At first glance, because proposals can always be redrafted during the legislative process, this does not seem like a good enough reason to withdraw a proposal, especially given today’s judgment – and there is still time to bring an annulment action against these withdrawals. One might argue that a new Commission has more leeway to withdraw proposals, but this raises questions about its democratic mandate, particularly if the Commission President did not campaign on withdrawing the proposals in question.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, it could be argued that this judgment has implications not only for the Commission but also for the ‘sincere cooperation’ between the EP and the Council during the legislative process. For instance, the EP and Council have been at loggerheads for years regarding a proposal for maternity leave. Recently, the EP has indicated a willingness to negotiate, which the Council has rejected. Meanwhile, the Commission has done little to try to mediate a compromise, instead resorting to threats of withdrawing the proposal if no agreement is reached. Can the EP sue the Council for being obstructive? Could it sue the Commission if it follows through with its threat to withdraw the proposal after having played no constructive role in the negotiations? If the EU institutions and Member States start to frequently exploit the opportunities this judgment creates, this kind of judicial intervention in the legislative process raises numerous important questions.&lt;/p>

Connecting these branches seamlessly without breaking the bank is a common challenge. Thankfully, two high-performance networking technologies, Metro Ethernet and MPLS Networks, offer affordable solutions that weren&amp;rsquo;t available even a decade ago.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Carrier Ethernet takes the local networking capabilities of Ethernet and extends them across entire cities. This means easy connection and efficient transmission without needing protocol conversions. Since the entire network, both local and wide area, can use level 2 switching, branch offices can access resources just like the main office. This Ethernet approach also tends to be cheaper than traditional telecom options due to increased competition.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MPLS, or Multi-Protocol Label Switching, is another option. It creates secure, high-performance networks capable of transporting various data types. Many providers now use MPLS for its ability to control network factors like jitter and latency, making it perfect for combined voice and data networks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ethernet and MPLS are very compatible. Companies often use Ethernet for local connections and MPLS for long-distance links, creating a powerful and flexible network.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you need to connect branch offices, explore the pricing and availability of Ethernet and MPLS services. You might be surprised at the options available.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Myth #1: All adjusting entries must be finalized before closing the General Ledger.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is false. Dynamics GP allows posting to the most recent historical year. After closing 2009, for instance, adjustments can still be made to it, just not to 2008. This requires enabling &amp;ldquo;allow posting to history&amp;rdquo; in GL setup and ensuring the fiscal period is open in Fiscal Period Setup.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Myth #2: The general ledger year-end close process is stuck if it appears unresponsive.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The year-end close is a demanding process, often causing temporary unresponsiveness. Patience is key. Interrupting the process using Ctrl-Alt-Delete is strongly discouraged and necessitates restoring from a backup. Always have backups and be patient.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Myth #3: Creating an audit period provides a comprehensive view of audit entries.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While creating a 13th period for audit entries seems clever, issues arise with financial reconciliation. This process might misattribute postings, causing inaccuracies. A better solution is using a dedicated source document code (e.g., &amp;ldquo;AJ&amp;rdquo; for adjusting entries) for easy tracking via the Cross Reference by Source Document report.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Myth #4: Closing the Fixed Assets year is as simple as changing the year on the books.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Incorrect. Always use the dedicated Fixed Asset year-end closing routine. Manually altering the year on the books is not advised and may require restoring from a backup. Additionally, complete all prior-year activities in Fixed Assets before starting new-year activities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Myth #5: The timing of closing Receivables and Payables is flexible.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The year-end close for Payables and Receivables impacts the &amp;ldquo;Amounts Since Last Close&amp;rdquo; summaries, crucial for accurate reporting. Performing these closes near the actual year-end, after posting most prior-year activity, ensures the most precise figures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, a $500 payable posted on January 1, 2010, but before closing the year on January 2, 2010, will be attributed to the previous year in the &amp;ldquo;Amounts Since Last Close&amp;rdquo; summary. Conversely, a $1,000 payable posted on January 3, 2010, after the year-end close, will be allocated to the current year, even if backdated to December 20, 2009.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While these discrepancies might seem minor, they can create inconsistencies in vendor or customer summaries and year-over-year comparisons.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Clearing the Dynamics GP User ID field on Terminal Servers</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/clearing-the-dynamics-gp-user-id-field-on-terminal-servers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jun 2024 01:11:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/clearing-the-dynamics-gp-user-id-field-on-terminal-servers/</guid><description>&lt;p>This article addresses a known issue in Dynamics GP, specifically regarding user ID retention on Terminal Servers. While convenient for single users, this feature can be disruptive in multi-user environments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The issue arises when multiple users log in and out of Dynamics GP on a Terminal Server. The system tends to remember the last user&amp;rsquo;s ID, forcing subsequent users to manually replace it with their own. This behavior, though seemingly minor, can be perceived as a security concern or simply an annoyance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One effective solution involves using a VBA script, as outlined in KB Article 859129, &amp;ldquo;Blank User ID in Great Plains&amp;rdquo;. This script clears the User ID field upon login, providing a straightforward resolution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Previously, making the Dex.ini file read-only was suggested as a solution. However, this method is no longer recommended. For more details, refer to the reader comments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While making the Dex.ini file read-only might seem effective in clearing the last user ID, it can have unintended consequences. This file stores various user preferences that enhance the Dynamics GP experience. Making it read-only prevents not only the saving of the last user ID but also other helpful settings, potentially leading to new issues or user inconvenience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This method&amp;rsquo;s lack of documentation in the Knowledge Base and potential for side effects suggest it may not be a supported solution. It&amp;rsquo;s important to weigh the drawbacks before implementing such a fix.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): Rebuilding the Output Board, Installation of a Grounding Switch and Repair of the Keypad</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-rebuilding-the-output-board-installation-of-a-grounding-switch-and-repair-of-the-keypad/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jun 2024 19:38:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-rebuilding-the-output-board-installation-of-a-grounding-switch-and-repair-of-the-keypad/</guid><description>&lt;p>My Beogram 4002 (5513) restoration is almost done.

Which one is the right fit? Here&amp;rsquo;s a breakdown of what&amp;rsquo;s available and what makes sense for home-based work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Residential broadband services are often the best choice for home offices, primarily because they&amp;rsquo;re the most affordable. These services are usually confined to residential areas. While businesses in commercial zones might have access to cable broadband, they often pay double the price for a similar connection with potentially enhanced customer service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Besides cost, residential broadband suits home offices because occasional brief outages and fluctuating bandwidths are generally acceptable in exchange for savings. If a 20-minute outage wouldn&amp;rsquo;t disrupt your workflow, residential broadband is a cost-effective choice. Additionally, consider your VoIP needs. If you&amp;rsquo;re using VoIP phones, ensure the bandwidth can handle decent call quality with minimal drops. A single broadband connection might be sufficient for both your phone and internet usage with a good router that prioritizes voice packets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finding the best residential broadband deal is simple with online tools. Using a service like &amp;ldquo;Can I Get DSL?&amp;rdquo; helps you quickly compare available options and prices by entering your information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that these search engines need your landline phone number to pinpoint your location accurately. This is crucial because broadband services are location-dependent; what&amp;rsquo;s available to your neighbor might not be accessible to you. DSL, in particular, relies on high-frequency signals transmitted through existing telephone lines, limiting its reach. This distance constraint applies to both residential and business DSL.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you don&amp;rsquo;t have a landline and rely solely on a cell phone or VoIP, determining DSL availability might be difficult. Since DSL uses the same lines as landline phones, you&amp;rsquo;ll need a neighbor&amp;rsquo;s landline number (with their consent) to run a search and get an idea of potential services. To establish service, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to contact the cable company directly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Verizon FIOS, a fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) service, is becoming increasingly available, particularly in the New York metropolitan area. This service offers high-speed internet with download speeds up to 30 Mbps, along with phone and television services, all delivered through fiber optic cables.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Satellite internet is another option if you&amp;rsquo;re in a rural location or an area not served by DSL or Cable. Although it&amp;rsquo;s pricier than other residential choices and comes with equipment fees, it&amp;rsquo;s a viable alternative to dial-up. However, keep in mind that the latency (delay) inherent in satellite internet makes it unsuitable for VoIP; conversations might resemble walkie-talkie exchanges.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wireless broadband, offered by local providers with limited coverage areas, can be found through newspaper ads or the Yellow Pages. It can be a comparable alternative to cable broadband in terms of quality and cost, especially in smaller counties where cable internet might be limited.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Professional-grade telecom services, like T1, are common for businesses needing reliable connectivity. T1 offers consistent 1.5 Mbps upload and download speeds, often with service level agreements for guaranteed uptime. While significantly more expensive (around $400/month in major cities), it provides superior reliability, faster repair times, and potential managed router services. This level of service is generally chosen by individuals with demanding professions requiring top-tier connectivity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Business DSL, another option, is usually found in commercially zoned areas near telephone company offices. Offering symmetrical bandwidth (similar upload and download speeds) at higher costs than residential DSL, it shares the same distance limitations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other business-oriented bandwidth solutions, such as T3 or DS3 (45 Mbps) and fiber optic Ethernet (10 Mbps to 1 Gbps), are geared towards larger companies. Starting around $2,000 per month, they are rarely justifiable for home office use.&lt;/p>

In this instance, a Beogram 4002 exhibited inconsistent behavior when attempting to locate the record&amp;rsquo;s setdown point after pressing start. This pointed to a potential fault in the carriage position sensor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Initially, I suspected the IR LED, a common culprit in later models like this 5513 Type. I replaced the LED, adjusted the brightness, and achieved the desired 5V output at the photo sensor cathode. The unit seemed to function correctly, successfully finding the setdown point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the issue resurfaced. The voltage fluctuated, and the setdown point was no longer reliably detected. I replaced the brightness adjustment trimmer, suspecting oxidation, but the problem persisted. With other components ruled out, I began to consider the photocell, despite never having had to replace one before. Testing the photocell with a multimeter revealed intermittent responsiveness, confirming its failure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because this specific photocell functions as a photoresistor in the circuit, I opted to replace it with a standard photoresistor. This required modifying the photocell housing to securely accommodate the new component. After redesigning and 3D printing a new insert, I was able to install a standard GL5539 photoresistor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After experimenting with different photoresistor types, I found that the GL5539 provided consistent performance under various lighting conditions. It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that adjusting the LED intensity using R88 might be necessary to ensure reliable switching of TR17 based on the presence or absence of a black stripe in front of the sensor. Monitoring the collector voltage of TR17 with a voltmeter is recommended during this adjustment process.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>T1 PRI For Call Centers</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/t1-pri-for-call-centers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jun 2024 04:29:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/t1-pri-for-call-centers/</guid><description>&lt;p>When deciding on phone service for your call center, digital options are essential. While individual analog lines work for small setups, they lack integration capabilities and become costly as you expand beyond a few lines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For call centers with 10-12 lines using traditional PBX systems, digital T1 carrier service is a cost-effective solution. T1 lines offer two configuration options: channelized and PRI (Primary Rate Interface). Channelized T1 provides 24 independent lines suitable for various call types but lacks advanced features like Caller ID.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>PRI, on the other hand, utilizes 23 voice channels and one dedicated data channel, enabling faster call setup, Caller ID, and integration with Computer Telephone Integration (CTI) systems for enhanced customer data display. Multiple PRI lines can be combined for increased capacity, and using two data channels ensures redundancy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>VoIP (Voice over IP) systems offer another approach. By converting voice into digital data, VoIP leverages your existing Ethernet network for both phones and computers. Unchannelized T1 lines, or data T1 lines, are used for data transmission beyond your facility, offering 1.5 Mbps bandwidth and the ability to combine multiple lines for increased bandwidth through bonding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To determine the most suitable and cost-effective T1 service for your call center, consult with experts like Shop for T1. Their consultants can assess your specific requirements and provide competitive quotes. Requesting a T1 service quote is quick, easy, and free. Remember that T1 lines are intended for business use, not residential purposes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Rose Is On The Bloom</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-rose-is-on-the-bloom/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jun 2024 01:12:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-rose-is-on-the-bloom/</guid><description>&lt;p>Bloom Energy recently introduced its &amp;ldquo;Energy Server&amp;rdquo; fuel cell, presenting it as a significant step towards greener energy and energy independence. This begs the question: how impactful will this new technology actually be?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://www.T1Explainer.com/images/VoltMeterXLS.jpg"
loading="lazy"
alt="More clean and less expensive power is what we need."
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While it&amp;rsquo;s early to definitively say, Bloom Energy&amp;rsquo;s generators could become a vital part of energy production and management, or even revolutionize our relationship with energy entirely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Bloom Energy Server originated from a NASA project aimed at generating air and fuel from electricity for Mars expeditions. When the project concluded, Dr. KR Sridhar and his team realized the technology could be reversed to produce electricity using air and fuel. After five years, they had a working prototype, and within a few more, they scaled it to a commercial level of 100 KW. Now, the Energy Server is a viable product, implemented by major corporations like Google and Ebay.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, how does it work, and what makes it superior to other green energy solutions? The Bloom Energy Server is a high-temperature fuel cell that transforms hydrocarbon fuel and oxygen into water and electricity. This technology was first explored during the Apollo Moon program when NASA utilized fuel cells in their spacecraft. Bloom&amp;rsquo;s innovation lies in using a ceramic plate as a dielectric, coated with proprietary inks to facilitate chemical reactions. Each handheld plate can generate about 1 KW of electricity, and by stacking them in modules, power output can reach 10 KW for a home or 100 KW for a small business.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.bloomenergy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;img src="http://www.T1Explainer.com/images/BloomFuelCellLargeAnnotated350.jpg"
loading="lazy"
alt="Inside the Bloom Fuel Cell"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The fuel cell runs on natural gas directly from utility lines, landfill methane, or other available bio-gases, with oxygen sourced from the air. It produces heat and steam, essential for sustaining the reaction, and releases a small amount of CO2 as a byproduct – less than burning the gas directly. This process is cleaner and more efficient than using a gas turbine generator.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It can be compared to a quiet, solid-state gas turbine generator without exhaust, making it a suitable replacement for engine-based backup generators in homes and businesses. Currently, the cost is prohibitive for residential use. However, it offers a roughly three-year payback for businesses using it as an alternative energy source, not just backup power. This is impressive for a newly released product in limited production. As production scales up, prices are expected to decrease. Additionally, Bloom Energy Servers will be offered in a wider range of models with varying power levels.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even if this technology simply offered a new way to convert natural gas to electricity, it would still be significant. But it&amp;rsquo;s more than that. Being a clean, quiet device that can be installed next to a building with a similar size and appearance to a large electrical transformer, it allows for more distributed power generation. If the price becomes more accessible, with a one-year payoff or better, there might be a rush by medium and large businesses to install these systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We anticipated this to happen with solar panels, but cost and the fluctuating nature of solar power hindered widespread adoption. Google, a Bloom Energy Server user, has installed large solar panel arrays, but these remain uncommon in the U.S. Wind energy is more popular but also suffers from inconsistent output due to wind variability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Critics of green energy use these limitations to dismiss the idea of moving away from traditional hydrocarbon fuels. However, this perspective is too narrow. The solution isn&amp;rsquo;t a single breakthrough like fusion but a multi-faceted approach using various technologies managed by a smart grid that distributes energy efficiently. For example, solar power is ideal for peak air conditioning demands during summer midday hours when solar panels generate the most power.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A truly smart grid could even leverage millions of electric cars parked in garages to regulate grid stability by quickly supplying or absorbing small amounts of electricity. The Bloom Energy Server could serve a similar function on a commercial scale. Imagine companies having both a Bloom unit and solar panels on their premises. Our struggling energy grid would stabilize, potentially allowing us to decommission outdated coal-fired power plants.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course, we still need baseload power, which alternative sources can&amp;rsquo;t currently provide. This highlights the need for more nuclear plants to reduce carbon emissions. Bloom Energy Servers, in large numbers, could potentially contribute to baseload power. However, it&amp;rsquo;s unclear how much natural gas we&amp;rsquo;ll have if we replace coal with gas on a large scale. Additionally, converting fossil fuels to electricity inherently releases some CO2.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We don&amp;rsquo;t yet know how successful we can be if we fully commit to energy independence and green energy. We can&amp;rsquo;t claim to have truly tried until solar panels, windmills, and people selling excess electricity to the grid become commonplace. We reached the moon in under a decade using fuel cells. Imagine how quickly we could solve our energy challenges if we fully dedicated ourselves to wind, solar, and fuel cell technologies.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Remembering &amp;lsquo;76 and a Class About Dirt&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yesterday&amp;rsquo;s blog post about soil microbes reminded me of my college soil science class back in the fall of 1976. I was attending Sterling College, although at the time it was a far cry from the established institution it is today. Back then, it was a former prep school attempting to reinvent itself, offering a unique one-year program called The Grassroots Project in Vermont - a very &amp;rsquo;70s endeavor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve written about my time at Sterling before, but never about my experience in &amp;ldquo;Dirt Class,&amp;rdquo; which was the actual name of the course. Our instructor, who told us to call him &amp;ldquo;Tar,&amp;rdquo; is pictured in the photo above.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even though 1976 feels like ages ago, I distinctly recall the class being called &amp;ldquo;Dirt Class&amp;rdquo; and our teacher being named Tar. The photo clearly shows Tar holding a tetrahedron. I&amp;rsquo;m certain about these details because I wrote them on the back of the picture myself, back in 1976&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEipGw7BeurPZS4SYdyT_a1-lnyW8Cy5ovY-550FR5-RT_MVRbuoES5JkKv5hlLdbcHS98X8us7TcwkJrnR6saJftPSyeimoMbHQ6YDx7zm1v-kv-OZqMoqAuK3LenmEyLwexUmeFKMU5oM/s1600/Tar&amp;#43;Dirt&amp;#43;Class&amp;#43;760.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

loading="lazy"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[Is it true that cursive writing is no longer taught in schools? Can anyone confirm?]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tar was actually a University of Vermont professor who commuted to Sterling approximately once a week to teach our class of roughly 70 students.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the tetrahedron suggests, the class focused on dirt - an inert medium. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>To clarify, &lt;em>dirt&lt;/em> comprises sand, silt, clay, and organic matter. It should not be mistaken for &lt;em>soil&lt;/em>, which includes a rich diversity of living microorganisms like bacteria, fungi, protozoa, nematodes, and micro-arthropods alongside sand, silt, clay, and organic matter, as Elaine Ingam often emphasizes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Soil microorganisms can be either beneficial or harmful. Well-structured, aerated soils that haven&amp;rsquo;t been excessively tilled or subjected to synthetic chemicals promote beneficial microbial activity and, consequently, plant health.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Conversely, in poorly aerated, chemically-treated soils, harmful microorganisms thrive, creating an environment that hinders optimal plant growth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Had Tar imparted knowledge about the complex web of life within the soil, it&amp;rsquo;s something I would have remembered. However, that wasn&amp;rsquo;t the case, though it wasn&amp;rsquo;t his fault. The understanding of soil biology was quite limited in 1976.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Considering the advancements made in the past 41 years, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be surprising if our current understanding of soil seems elementary in another 41 years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Speaking of which, I&amp;rsquo;ll be celebrating my 100th birthday in 41 years (and everyone&amp;rsquo;s invited!).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I recall Tar as a good teacher who tried his best to make learning about dirt engaging. We never had any exams, only lectures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most memorable experience from Dirt Class was an exceptional autumn afternoon. As Tar was engrossed in explaining tetrahedrons, the sunlight streaming through the west windows of Simpson Hall turned a captivating shade of golden.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our attention drifted towards the window, and Tar, noticing this, paused his lecture. Some students got up to take a closer look. The sunset over the common was breathtaking. Recognizing the moment, Tar exclaimed, &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s all go outside and enjoy the sunset!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We all left Simpson Hall, crossed the road, and gathered on the common to admire the beauty of that place and that particular moment. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was truly special.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Regarding GP Notes, my experience suggests limited consistent usage of the GP Note fields and even less utilization of the OLE Container feature for file attachments or embedding content. However, I believe a more accessible, open, or standardized file format could potentially increase adoption rates and open up intriguing integration opportunities for data sharing with external systems. This could even pave the way for automating document attachments, simplifying the process for users and bypassing the somewhat cumbersome OLE Container window.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Alternatively, many robust third-party document management modules for Dynamics GP offer impressive features for handling file attachments linked to GP transactions. For companies requiring extensive file integration with GP data, these solutions might be more suitable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For those invested in GP Notes and OLE attachments, Mariano&amp;rsquo;s follow-up post is definitely worth exploring.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Data can be moved in many ways. The new top choice is Fiber Optic Ethernet, known as EoF or Ethernet over Fiber, which offers excellent value.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/a>&lt;strong>What is Fiber Optic Ethernet Transport?&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
When fiber optic lines were first installed, Ethernet wasn&amp;rsquo;t a factor. The standard was SONET (Synchronous Optical NETworking), designed to carry existing DS1 and DS3 phone calls on fiber. Fiber offered significantly more bandwidth than copper twisted pair, microwave, or coaxial cable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ethernet started in computer networking. Sending this data outside required protocol conversion for T-carrier and SONET fiber to carry data packets instead of phone calls. Eventually, carrying Ethernet directly was standardized, creating Ethernet over Copper and Ethernet over Fiber. Wireless options like WiFi and WiMAX emerged for shorter distances, using microwave, laser, and radio systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Immense Advantage of Fiber Optic Ethernet&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Carrier Ethernet, adopted by various providers, is directly compatible with computer networks, eliminating protocol conversion. Services like E-LAN can even connect multiple LANs into one large network.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ethernet is also easily scalable. Traditional MAN or WAN services offer fixed speeds (like T1 at 1.5 Mbps or DS3 at 45 Mbps), limiting data transmission and requiring upgrades for more bandwidth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fiber Ethernet has a nearly limitless ceiling. Each fiber strand can handle around 10 Gbps and be multiplied many times over. With hundreds of strands in a cable, capacity is rarely an issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Payment is based on the service level, such as 100 Mbps or 1 Gbps. Upgrading is often as simple as a phone call, with port capacity (often 1 Gbps to 100 Gbps) as the limit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Best Advantage of All&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Competition and fiber optics&amp;rsquo; capacity have driven prices per Mbps lower than ever, often surpassing SONET. These reliable circuits often have service guarantees, symmetrical upload/download speeds, and dedicated bandwidth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Competing Bandwidth Options&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Ethernet over Copper offers similar benefits for bandwidths of 10-25 Mbps. T1 lines are viable for lower speeds (1.5-3 Mbps).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Budget-friendly choices, mostly shared bandwidth for consumers, include business cable broadband, wireless internet, satellite, DSL, and cellular broadband. While Mbps prices are tempting, these often have asymmetrical speeds (download significantly faster than upload).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wireless options usually have usage limits, unsuitable for large downloads. Satellite, though widely available, has latency issues affecting real-time applications.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These services are almost exclusively internet access. In contrast, Fiber Ethernet offers dedicated internet access or private point-to-point lines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The best bandwidth service for your business depends on your needs. With more options and better pricing than you might expect, discover what &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.gigapackets.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

This piece fits into a 10mm opening on the remote control receiver board, allowing it to be secured using one of the main PCB&amp;rsquo;s screws. The image below shows the part with the screw in place:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Once the remote control board is in place, the original screw can be used to fasten it. The cylindrical portion is designed to prevent the remote board from pressing against the component pins on the Beogram&amp;rsquo;s main PCB while ensuring a secure fit. The image below depicts the installed and secured part:&lt;/p>
