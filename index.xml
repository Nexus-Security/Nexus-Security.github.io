He highlights the challenge of managing complex queries and Data Definition Language (DDL) scripts during deployment, especially for customizations requiring custom tables in multiple company databases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Endow emphasizes the convenience of deploying AddIns by simply copying the DLL file and seeks to automate SQL script execution. He introduces a method to check for table existence and addresses the limitation of ADO.NET in handling complex scripts with &amp;ldquo;GO&amp;rdquo; commands.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The solution involves utilizing SQL Server Management Objects (SMO), which allows execution of multi-step SQL scripts. Endow provides a code snippet demonstrating the use of SMO&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>ExecuteNonQuery&lt;/code> method for this purpose.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Further, he recommends storing large SQL scripts within Visual Studio&amp;rsquo;s Resources feature for better organization and management. He illustrates how to access and execute these scripts efficiently using a simple method.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Endow concludes by sharing his discovery regarding the return value of SMO&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>ExecuteNonQuery&lt;/code> method and the significance of &amp;ldquo;GO&amp;rdquo; commands in DDL scripts. He expresses his enthusiasm for this automated approach, eliminating the need for manual SQL script execution during deployment.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Turning Junk Frequencies Into Gold</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/turning-junk-frequencies-into-gold/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2024 20:06:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/turning-junk-frequencies-into-gold/</guid><description>&lt;p>The 2.4 GHz WiFi band we use every day wasn&amp;rsquo;t originally designed for WiFi at all. It was part of the ISM band - Industrial, Scientific, and Medical - a section of the radio spectrum designated for devices that unintentionally emit radiation as a byproduct of their operation. These bands, ranging from 6.78 MHz to 245 GHz, were meant for devices like microwave ovens, industrial heaters, and medical equipment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The 2.4 GHz band, specifically the range of 2.4 to 2.5 GHz, is shared by devices like microwave ovens and 802.11b/g WiFi. This might seem problematic, but the ISM bands were not originally set up for licensed, intentional transmission. The emissions from ISM devices were considered a necessary side effect.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, in 1985, the FCC opened these bands for intentional use, allowing technologies like cordless phones, wireless networking, and even video transmission to operate without a license. This decision came with a few caveats: a power limit of 4 watts and a &amp;ldquo;no complaints&amp;rdquo; policy regarding interference. If a microwave oven disrupts your WiFi, it&amp;rsquo;s simply an unavoidable consequence of using this unlicensed spectrum.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You might wonder why anyone would choose to use these interference-prone frequencies. The answer is the appeal of license-free operation and sufficient power for various wireless technologies. The limited range of these signals, combined with interference-resistant modulation techniques like DSSS, FHSS, and OFDM, makes sharing the spectrum feasible. These techniques are employed in various technologies, including cordless phones, WiFi (802.11b, a, g), Bluetooth, and WiMAX, allowing them to function effectively within the ISM bands.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 Type 5513: Some Cabinet Work</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-some-cabinet-work/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2024 16:52:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-some-cabinet-work/</guid><description>&lt;p>Over the weekend, I made progress reassembling the Beogram 4002, focusing on the cabinet trim and deck cover. To prevent damage, I had previously removed the rosewood trim.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The trim is attached to a metal frame that slides in and out to lock and unlock the cabinet. This frame relies on five guide washers, which are commonly broken in Beogram 4002 units. This one was no different. These washers have a unique design, as detailed in a past Beolover blog post.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This Beogram now has replacements for these washers, thanks to 3D printed versions from Beolover.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While it might seem possible to use standard flat washers as substitutes, the specially designed printed parts are essential for correctly assembling the Beogram cabinet. As explained in the Beolover blog post, these washers act as guides for the cabinet locking frame to slide smoothly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While attaching the cabinet trim and lock, I discovered the frame was separating from the rosewood along the front.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiii4loT-3N7KR7IONlkUutyXjURF7m9ycyk4A_1RB6yWxF7TfgRcH6CY2fQMI4SC0oq0_o9Nf4JPLt6uLtJipVfvHwITOF3L4gWrLF_JBzF7QGhpRL0qLUdu5rcLSDCbYbDOsKf15lkIM/s1600/beogram_8000_cabinet_repair_001.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This separation needed to be fixed with epoxy before I could proceed. Gluing it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a good option due to the risk of mess and potential damage. To work on it safely, I carefully removed the trim piece. To protect the rosewood finish, I covered it with painter&amp;rsquo;s tape, preventing scratches or glue residue. The picture shows the areas prepared for the epoxy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgHWsx0VGiNidAbt94h39PUgNYpQ0RpnQ2DiSDm6HYgWyjKvbz5e9EekMHokWxCQegWSDCqu0eqIj4l7rKYz9s8QosGz-EuOdi8sbKxMiAQMBprqeDNIao0D1Q6OPnim5i4wysaU5iMu3M/s1600/beogram_8000_cabinet_repair_002.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>I used small clamps, similar to the larger ones in my workshop, which are ideal for delicate tasks like this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjjfu183PzBabHML-7Y8TyzU7SFMEeSZ7KpdeXJW4bgOCgLFC0jx4ANkubL-8IMA_MgIiJ9ocB5E06NEi4lmVCKDOKr6ehOZxZIbNP1WPvwXnZJph92MAcA_peNTfdhZW6nrpGCeR_Ymi0/s1600/beogram_8000_cabinet_repair_003.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For this repair, I opted for slow-drying epoxy, which allows ample time for cleanup and adjustments. I let it dry overnight.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The following morning, the trim and locking piece were ready. I attached it to the cabinet using the five guide washers. The fit is snug and visually appealing.&lt;/p>

While getting a fraction of a T1 line&amp;rsquo;s capacity seemed like a good idea for those who didn&amp;rsquo;t need the full 1.5 Mbps, the cost savings weren&amp;rsquo;t as significant as one might expect.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The issue is that the infrastructure for a T1 line, the &amp;ldquo;pipe,&amp;rdquo; has a fixed capacity regardless of actual usage. Even if you only use a fraction of the bandwidth, the underlying cost remains largely the same. Although fractional T1 lines were offered, they were often priced disproportionately to the actual bandwidth used.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nowadays, getting fractional speeds can be more expensive than a full T1 line due to the specialized engineering required. It&amp;rsquo;s sometimes more cost-effective to order the full T1 and not utilize its entire capacity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Traditional telecom services lack scalability, offering large jumps between service levels. A newer technology, Carrier Ethernet (also known as Metro Ethernet), addresses this limitation with its high scalability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Carrier Ethernet offers standard network speeds like 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, and 1000 Mbps, but also provides a wide range of bandwidth options in between. The key is to have a port that can handle your maximum expected speed, allowing you to easily upgrade bandwidth later with a simple phone call to your provider.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To avoid paying for unused capacity, compare pricing for fractional T1, DS3, and OC3 services with Ethernet over Copper and Ethernet over Fiber. Since prices depend on location, request a specific quote for your business address.&lt;/p>

While traditional solutions like private lines and Frame Relay have their merits, a newer method is gaining traction, especially for businesses with numerous sites.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Private lines offer unparalleled reliability, consistent bandwidth, and robust security due to their dedicated nature. They are well-suited for connecting phone systems or transmitting video between locations. However, the need for a separate line between each pair of sites makes them expensive, particularly as the network expands.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many businesses prefer a mesh network where all locations connect to a central network &amp;ldquo;cloud,&amp;rdquo; enabling communication between any two points. Frame Relay, private IP, and MPLS networks offer this, but a more cost-effective solution exists: the internet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While not as reliable or predictable as private networks, the internet&amp;rsquo;s widespread availability and affordability make it an attractive option for inter-site connectivity. Its limitations can be overcome, making it suitable for applications like email, point of sale transactions, data updates, and e-commerce. The TCP/IP protocol ensures reliable data transfer even with occasional slowdowns or minor data loss.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Security concerns are addressed through encryption, creating a &amp;ldquo;tunnel&amp;rdquo; for private data transmission over the public internet. This forms a virtual private network (VPN), combining aspects of both private and public networks. Various standardized methods like IPsec, PPTP, and SSL are available for establishing VPNs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Businesses can implement their own VPNs or utilize managed solutions where a provider oversees routers and security software. With high-speed internet connections becoming increasingly affordable, now might be an opportune time to implement a new VPN or upgrade existing systems for faster speeds and potentially lower costs.&lt;/p>

Upgrading bandwidth seems like the obvious solution, but it&amp;rsquo;s costly, especially since guests expect free Wi-Fi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While it seems logical that faster internet costs more, that&amp;rsquo;s not always true. Hotels can sometimes secure better internet speeds for less money. This depends on where they get their internet service and the age of their contracts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The internet landscape has changed rapidly. Many hotels signed contracts for wireless internet years ago when options were limited and technology was different. These contracts may be outdated and more expensive than current offerings. Just like phone lines, competition in the internet service market has increased, leading to better prices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many hotels aren&amp;rsquo;t equipped to navigate the complexities of telecom contracts. They might rely on technology vendors who may not be getting them the best deals. Instead of going through vendors, hotels can work with specialized telecom brokers. These brokers can identify competing internet providers in their area and find the best offers, saving hotels money.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Technology has also advanced. Options like Carrier Ethernet and bonded T1 lines offer attractive pricing and higher bandwidth. Increased competition and advanced search tools make finding affordable broadband services easier than ever. Hotels can likely find better internet service for a lower price than they are currently paying.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Alternate "Circuit Diagram 2" with 24V Scale Illumination Lamps</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-alternate-circuit-diagram-2-with-24v-scale-illumination-lamps/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jul 2024 14:12:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-alternate-circuit-diagram-2-with-24v-scale-illumination-lamps/</guid><description>&lt;p>I recently acquired a well-preserved Beogram 4000 service manual containing a unique supplementary diagram. This diagram, Circuit Diagram 2, outlines the control system and features a notable difference in the position scale illumination. Instead of the typical two 12V bulbs wired in series, it depicts two 24V bulbs connected in parallel to the 24V power source.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This discovery complicated a recent interaction with Sonavor, who is currently restoring his own Beogram 4000. We both mistakenly assumed his model used the 24V configuration based on my inquiry about providing 12V or 24V LED bulb replacements. Ultimately, his model utilizes the standard 12V setup.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nevertheless, I decided to share a high-resolution scan of this unusual 24V circuit diagram with fellow Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen enthusiasts.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A positive aspect of the design is the inclusion of diode D27, which safeguards the battery against reverse polarity connection. This suggests that replacing the soldered battery with a holder-based solution is a viable approach.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhmhdvCeJEmPIkADGYF6607Z-rMTPOBzi7E1_zTmQ1VED4t8ke036LScev278jZSCJ4O7GjRozVP6ryYd0rmmO1mv9bxn9Ioqrgi1gYQlAxf6DnVdDj9bIgIQJrr103o5_wXNiM1S3IkTYk/s1600/Old&amp;#43;Battery.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>The battery is situated directly beneath the TIME CAL indicator on the cabinet. In this instance, the original battery exhibited leakage of the lithium compound, evident as a green-grey substance surrounding it. During the battery removal process, a minor explosion occurred due to the leaked compound reacting with heat. Lithium&amp;rsquo;s high reactivity with oxygen in the presence of heat necessitates caution. Fortunately, protective eyewear prevented any harm. However, it is strongly advised to sever the battery leads using wire cutters before desoldering to minimize risk. Additionally, cleaning the area with ethanol to remove residual compound is recommended. The image below displays the battery location after cleaning.&lt;/p>

Despite its age, dial-up has significantly improved and remains a viable option for many, even in professional settings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Is dial-up outdated? Not really. Consider how you would access email or websites during a broadband outage. Even the most reliable DSL and cable providers experience occasional disruptions. It&amp;rsquo;s important to remember that broadband often prioritizes convenience over absolute necessity. When necessary, a simple phone line connection to your computer can provide 56K internet access.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not everyone requires constant internet connectivity. Paying $35 to $45 monthly for broadband or $24 for heavily advertised dial-up services is unnecessary for users who only spend an hour per day checking email and browsing websites. For those online 15 hours or less per month, options like CogniSurf at $7.95 a month are available. Alternatively, WorldVerge provides unlimited dial-up access for $9.95 a month.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What does $9.95 a month with WorldVerge entail? It includes unlimited 56K dial-up internet with spam and virus filtering, five email accounts, complimentary 24/7 technical support, and dialers for both PC and Macintosh. For an additional $2.95 per month, an accelerator option can increase email download and website access speeds by up to six times. While not impacting software downloads, website FTPs, or VoIP calls, this enhancement nearly replicates the broadband experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dial-up internet remains a viable and affordable option for various purposes, such as broadband backup, business travel, occasional use, and internet access in areas without DSL or cable coverage.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>While testing the eConnect GetNextNumber methods in Integration Manager, I encountered an error. My simple GL transaction import, using the eConnect destination adapter, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t run. After several minutes, I stopped the process, and eventually, an error message appeared indicating a SQL Exception in the GetNextNumber method.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[Image]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My initial troubleshooting, including checking SQL Server for errors, running a SQL Profiler trace, and monitoring SQL Activity, yielded no clues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, I then recalled a setting from the integration setup.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[Image]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Server Name had defaulted to localhost, which I didn&amp;rsquo;t change since IM and SQL Server resided on the same machine. However, my setup utilizes a named SQL Server instance, rendering localhost ineffective.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Changing the Server Name to the correct instance name resolved the issue, allowing the integration to run smoothly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The lack of a timeout or a more descriptive error message from IM, such as &amp;ldquo;Unable to connect to SQL Server,&amp;rdquo; was perplexing. Nonetheless, the solution was straightforward once I identified the root cause.&lt;/p>

This particular motor uses brushes and has simple sleeve bearings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To access the bearings for lubrication, the pulley and outer housing were removed. The pulley is attached to the shaft with glue, allowing for easy removal. After taking out two small screws, the housing can be opened and the motor taken out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, the black rubber vibration insulation boot was removed, revealing the circuit board connected to the brushes. After noting the position of the bottom part, three screws were removed to detach it and the brush plate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The bottom bearing was lubricated by applying a small amount of silicone grease into the bottom sleeve located below the brushes. The top bearing was greased by applying a bit to the shaft and moving it up and down within the bearing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The motor was then reassembled, using the slanted plastic disc on the commutator to guide the brushes into place during reassembly. Following the disassembly steps in reverse, the motor was placed back into the outer housing. Finally, the pulley was reattached to the shaft using superglue gel.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Cosmetic Items, Final Adjustments, and a Test Drive with George Duke on MPS!</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-cosmetic-items-final-adjustments-and-a-test-drive-with-george-duke-on-mps-/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jul 2024 13:18:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-cosmetic-items-final-adjustments-and-a-test-drive-with-george-duke-on-mps-/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Beogram 4000 restoration project, originating from Germany, is nearing completion. After adjusting the sub-chassis and arm height, I set the arm lowering limit, a crucial measure to protect the stylus from potential damage if the record detection fails.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, I calibrated the tracking weight, opting to enhance stability by replacing the original locking washer setup with an M3 nut and washer to secure the counterweight position.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following that, I calibrated the arm weight using a digital scale and fine-tuned the feedback by adjusting the tracking sensor LED with a blue potentiometer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The final adjustment involved setting the motor voltage, confirmed by achieving smooth sine curves on the oscilloscope for both 33 and 45 RPM.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To complete the restoration, I replaced the damaged main aluminum platter and arm cover with pristine parts from a 4002 5501 Beogram and a donor 4004, respectively. I specifically sought an early 4002 arm cover to match the 4000&amp;rsquo;s aesthetic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, I tested the restored Beogram 4000 with a George Duke record, &amp;ldquo;Liberated Fantasies,&amp;rdquo; a personal favorite from the MPS label. Witnessing this turntable perform flawlessly after its initial damaged state was incredibly rewarding.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Samsung MM-A940 Two Megapixel Camera Phone</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/samsung-mm-a940-two-megapixel-camera-phone/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jul 2024 23:20:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/samsung-mm-a940-two-megapixel-camera-phone/</guid><description>&lt;p>We regret to inform you that the Samsung MM-A940 special offer is no longer active.

This unique feature accommodates the powerful 2 Megapixel camera positioned in the hinge area, shooting sideways. By swiveling the screen, you transform your phone into a compact camcorder capable of recording and sending video clips with sound in addition to capturing still photos.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The A940&amp;rsquo;s large screen, measuring 176 x 220 pixels and displaying over 262,000 colors, complements the high-resolution camera. A smaller external color display provides essential information when the phone is closed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>True to its &amp;ldquo;MM&amp;rdquo; (multi-media) designation, the A940 goes beyond video capabilities to offer a built-in MP3 player with stereo sound. An expandable memory card slot enables you to store your music and video collection.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The MM-A940 is also recognized as the EVDO-940. This designation signifies its compatibility with EVDO, a high-speed 3G (third-generation) network being deployed by Sprint across the United States. EVDO essentially delivers cellular broadband, allowing users in covered areas to enjoy on-demand TV video clips or music streaming with the optional Sprint PCS Vision Ultimate Pack.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hands-free convenience is a hallmark of the Samsung MM-A940. Advanced voice-activated dialing facilitates calling contacts simply by speaking their names, eliminating the need for voice training. The speakerphone function enables hands-free conversations, while a Bluetooth headset option allows for private calls without the constraints of wires.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>David The Good&amp;rsquo;s latest book, &lt;em>Push The Zone&lt;/em>, is out now on Amazon. I finished reading it this morning and really enjoyed it (&lt;a class="link" href="http://amzn.to/2kygGSb" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Click Here&lt;/a> for details).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The book&amp;rsquo;s introduction provides a solid overview, which I&amp;rsquo;ll summarize in the following paragraphs:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This book won&amp;rsquo;t perform miracles, such as teaching you to cultivate limes in Minnesota or cocoa in Manhattan. It also won&amp;rsquo;t help with your dating life, but you probably already knew that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 11.0px Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000} p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 11.0px Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000; min-height: 13.0px} span.s1 {font-kerning: none}&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What this book &lt;em>will&lt;/em> do is expand your gardening horizons. If you live a few hundred miles away from a climate where your desired plants thrive, the techniques within might help you cultivate them in your own backyard, much to your neighbors&amp;rsquo; astonishment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I reside in New York State, where the climate is far too cold to grow tropical plants outdoors. Despite this, many of the core principles in &lt;em>Push The Zone&lt;/em>, particularly those about microclimates, can be applied to my 4b-5a USDA Hardiness Zone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Peaches, for instance, struggle in my zone due to the cold. However, a few hundred miles south in Pennsylvania&amp;rsquo;s zone 6 regions, peaches flourish. &lt;em>Push The Zone&lt;/em> has given me the confidence to attempt growing a peach tree by utilizing microclimates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Admittedly, this book is geared towards gardeners in warmer U.S. regions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What distinguishes &lt;em>Push The Zone&lt;/em> is its engaging storytelling approach. The book is rich with practical advice conveyed through captivating narratives of David&amp;rsquo;s personal zone-pushing experiments and the experiences of other gardeners he&amp;rsquo;s encountered. These stories make the information both memorable and enjoyable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>David&amp;rsquo;s writing style is concise, witty, and impactful. While entertaining, the lessons are presented with seriousness and depth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having read four of David&amp;rsquo;s six books, I believe &lt;em>Push The Zone&lt;/em> could be his best work yet.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>IP Networking is currently the leading technology. Initially confined to local offices, IP has expanded to WANs at state, regional, and national levels. Today, almost all network designs are centered around IP or Internet Protocol.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What explains IP&amp;rsquo;s rapid growth? IP, and particularly Ethernet, dominate local area networking, offering high reliability, affordability, and near-universal connectivity. This local success naturally translates to wider adoption in metropolitan and long-haul networks. With a simple RJ45 connector interface, it&amp;rsquo;s no surprise that carriers are incorporating IP core networks into their infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MPLS, or MultiProtocol Label Switching, bridges the gap between older TDM (Time Division Multiplexing) networks with their synchronized channels and newer packet-switching networks. This includes Carrier Ethernet and the Internet, both operating under the IP umbrella.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MPLS brings the advantages of private networking to businesses of all sizes. It seamlessly interconnects diverse locations, offering class-based bandwidth that prioritizes voice, video, and data transmission with minimal latency, jitter, or packet loss. Since the cost of the MPLS cloud is shared among users under the network manager&amp;rsquo;s control, connecting your locations becomes very cost-effective.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>T1 lines, known for their dedicated bandwidth and reliability, often provide access to MPLS networks. Each location connects to the MPLS cloud through its own T1 line, with the cloud handling interconnectivity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ethernet rivals T1 lines when higher bandwidth is required locally or within a metro area. Choose Ethernet for superior performance at speeds of 10, 100, and 1,000 Mbps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MPLS and Ethernet are a powerful combination because they represent progress. They offer higher bandwidth options and lower costs per Mbps compared to older technologies like Frame Relay and SONET. If this aligns with your business needs, consider MPLS Networks and Metro &amp;amp; Carrier Ethernet. These services are available immediately.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sipping on the Trunk Lines</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/sipping-on-the-trunk-lines/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jul 2024 12:36:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/sipping-on-the-trunk-lines/</guid><description>&lt;p>The history of telephone trunks goes back to the early days of telephones. Trunks are lines that carry multiple phone conversations, initially connecting switchboards and switching offices. They&amp;rsquo;ve evolved from wire bundles to analog and now digital circuits, with T1, ISDN PRI, DS3, and SONET being common digital trunking services. However, SIP trunking is emerging as a popular alternative.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Telephone trunking saves money by combining multiple phone lines into a single high-bandwidth connection. T1 lines, including ISDN PRI, become cost-effective when exceeding 10-12 lines. ISDN PRI, a specific T1 type, provides up to 23 lines with Caller ID, making it popular for traditional PBX systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) trunking was designed for VoIP phone systems. SIP is a simple protocol widely used in enterprise VoIP systems. Many modern phones have built-in SIP and VoIP, connecting directly to LANs instead of separate phone networks. An IP PBX on the network manages calls between handsets and external lines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SIP trunking addresses connecting those external lines. While connecting individual lines to an IP PBX for PSTN termination is viable for small setups, SIP trunking offers a more efficient method. Similar to using T1 or ISDN PRI for digital trunking, SIP keeps calls in VoIP packet format, utilizing the same signaling as handsets and IP PBX.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many SIP trunks act as converged voice and data connections to providers, carrying internet traffic alongside calls. Voice is prioritized for quality, while remaining bandwidth serves internet needs. Call termination to the PSTN happens at the provider, who leverages bulk services for potential cost savings. On-network calls, even to other companies on the same service, may be free.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If SIP trunking seems beneficial for your business VoIP system, explore potential savings by checking out competitive SIP trunking phone services.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Samsung D307 is Built For Messaging</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/samsung-d307-is-built-for-messaging/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jul 2024 08:11:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/samsung-d307-is-built-for-messaging/</guid><description>&lt;p>We apologize, but the Samsung D307 is no longer available. To explore the latest cell phone deals and free phone offers, use our convenient &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.cellphoneplanfinder.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Cell Phone Plan Finder&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Samsung D307 combines the functionality of a computer, phone, and personal stenographer. This phone is perfect for those who prioritize messaging.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While many phones offer texting, it&amp;rsquo;s often cumbersome due to limited keys and multiple functions. Alternatively, bulky PDA-style phones are available but not pocket-friendly. The D307 offers a solution: a flip-phone, barely larger than a business card, with a backlit QWERTY keyboard and a rotating rectangular display.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When closed, the D307 resembles a typical clamshell phone, displaying essential information like date, time, signal strength, and battery life. Open it, and you&amp;rsquo;ll find a large 176 x 220 pixel color display. Make calls traditionally, use the speakerphone, or connect a Bluetooth headset for tangle-free conversations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The magic unfolds when texting. Swivel the display horizontally, transforming the phone into a miniature notebook computer. The QWERTY keyboard allows for quick and easy message composition. Alternatively, dictate your message using the built-in voice-to-text feature, effortlessly converting your spoken words into written text.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beyond being a phone, the D307 functions as a mini-computer, leveraging the Cingular EDGE network for data communication. It comes equipped with instant messaging, email, and a mobile web browser. All this, combined with a talk time of up to 300 minutes or 5 hours.&lt;/p>

This is a significant achievement in the telecommunications industry, which is characterized by independent small businesses. The key motivators for telephone system installers and network consultants to join this nationwide database are customer leads and residual income.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Businesses specializing in computer network and telephone sales and service usually operate locally or regionally. They value inquiries from nearby businesses that need equipment, installation, training, upgrades, or repairs. While traditional advertising methods like Yellow Pages were once sufficient, businesses now often compare prices and suppliers online. The VAR Network addresses this by providing a national database where potential buyers can quickly find local registered sellers. Searches can be tailored to specific equipment, services (wiring, routers, IP PBX systems, etc.), or brands (Cisco, Avaya, ShoreTel).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The VAR Network also features sections for refurbished equipment, VAR-posted ads seeking specific equipment, and searchable listings of network engineers by skillset.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Joining the VAR Network and accessing its features is free for both buyers and sellers. VARs who secure business through the network are expected to pay a finder&amp;rsquo;s fee – 10% of service charges and 2% for equipment. While leads are provided free to registered VARs, those who successfully convert leads receive more than those who don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Through Shop For T1, Telarus also provides support for voice and data lines within the VAR Network. This is beneficial because many VARs lack expertise in providing services like T1, DS3, Ethernet WAN, and Optical Carriers, often leaving this to the customer and local phone companies. Shop For T1 acts as a broker for multiple service providers, connecting customers with suitable products through a user-friendly online platform and a team of technical sales agents who streamline the ordering process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This collaboration allows VARs to access competitive quotes for their clients without becoming experts in these services. Customers benefit from better line prices than going directly to a phone company. VARs can offer a complete package of equipment and line service while earning residual commissions based on monthly customer usage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The VAR Network&amp;rsquo;s unique approach has generated significant interest from networking and phone system suppliers seeking to expand their customer base without additional marketing costs. The listing process is straightforward, involving a short online form and a telephone interview. Once listed, VARs can immediately start receiving leads from potential clients searching online.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Interested companies can explore the range of products and services offered by the VAR Network on their website. VARs can find the online application link on the Network&amp;rsquo;s homepage.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Pair of Beomaster 1900 Receivers for Restoration: Capacitor Replacement on Unit #2</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-pair-of-beomaster-1900-receivers-for-restoration-capacitor-replacement-on-unit-2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jul 2024 03:47:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-pair-of-beomaster-1900-receivers-for-restoration-capacitor-replacement-on-unit-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>The first Beomaster 1900 receiver is fully operational and undergoing testing in a listening room. However, the second unit still requires restoration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Initial assessment of the second Beomaster 1900 has already been completed, and now it&amp;rsquo;s time to begin replacing capacitors on the main circuit board.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main circuit board houses most of the capacitors that need replacing. Unfortunately, it cannot be removed for servicing and must remain connected to the wire harness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Replacing capacitors on this board requires flipping the Beomaster over repeatedly to desolder old components and solder new ones. While experienced restorers might remove multiple capacitors at once, a safer approach is to replace them one by one, carefully checking polarity and value.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To prevent damage from repeated movement, I desolder the transformer&amp;rsquo;s secondary power wires from the board before starting the recapping process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Several screws secure the main board to the chassis and heatsink assemblies. Since the plan involves replacing the thermal material on the output transistors, I remove the heatsinks to clean off the old paste.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With that done, the main board is ready for servicing. I use a simple foam block jig to support and protect the board during this process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, I replace the +15 VDC power supply filter capacitor and apply new thermal paste, using a Sil-Pad for the chassis-mounted transistor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the ±31 VDC power supply filter capacitors, I rearrange and reattach terminals with heat shrink for a secure connection.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The rest of the capacitor replacements on the main board are straightforward, although time-consuming.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the main board completed, only the Volume PCB and the Tone, Filter, and Tuning PCB remain to be recapped.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Increase Bandwidth Without Increasing Costs</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/increase-bandwidth-without-increasing-costs/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jul 2024 21:29:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/increase-bandwidth-without-increasing-costs/</guid><description>&lt;p>Companies need more bandwidth, especially for their wide area networks (WANs), but it can be very expensive. While high speeds are affordable within a company&amp;rsquo;s LAN, connecting to the outside world traditionally comes with much higher costs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is because WAN connections were typically provided by telecom companies using technology initially meant for phone services. While more modern providers have entered the market with updated infrastructure, even traditional providers are adapting to the demand for data services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This increased competition presents opportunities for businesses to save money on bandwidth. By comparing prices from different providers, companies may find better deals than their existing contracts, especially if those contracts are outdated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Engaging a telecom broker can simplify this process. Brokers can gather tailored quotes from multiple carriers, leveraging their relationships to secure competitive rates for businesses. Using a broker often results in better deals than businesses could get independently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another way to save on bandwidth costs is to switch to newer technologies. For example, Ethernet over Copper (EoC) offers comparable reliability and speed to traditional T1 lines but at a lower cost. EoC can provide double the bandwidth for the same price as a single T1 line, making it a cost-effective upgrade path.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Therefore, businesses have two primary options for increasing bandwidth without increasing costs: compare quotes from multiple providers, including newer entrants, and consider switching to newer, more cost-effective technologies like EoC. Utilizing both strategies can lead to significant savings on essential bandwidth services.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Numerous White Papers Available</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/numerous-white-papers-available/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jul 2024 19:08:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/numerous-white-papers-available/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been going through a phase where white papers feel incredibly relevant to challenges we face internally and with clients.

&lt;p>This week, I completed a custom Dynamics GP 2013 eConnect integration created as a Visual Studio Tools AddIn. The client wanted a GP menu item to open the integration window, so I used the Menus for Visual Studio Tools library to create a custom menu item.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The integration worked perfectly, and I packaged it for deployment at the client site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, during final testing and verification, I encountered unusual window behavior. The custom VST window would sometimes open &amp;ldquo;CenterScreen&amp;rdquo; as intended, but other times it would open in the screen&amp;rsquo;s upper left corner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After further testing, the window seemed to open centered on the first launch after starting GP. Subsequent openings would position it in the screen&amp;rsquo;s upper left corner. I attempted various settings, including manually setting the window Location property, to center the window. Despite these efforts, the window would consistently open in the upper left corner, disregarding my code&amp;rsquo;s manual Location setting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Random window positions are incredibly frustrating, especially when they appear in the upper left corner for no apparent reason.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Perplexed, I built a new VS Tools project with a test window. When opened from GP, this window functioned correctly, consistently opening in the center. This discrepancy deepened the mystery.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I meticulously compared every window property in my integration project with the test VST project. All properties were identical, yet the behavior differed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, I noticed a distinction. In my test project, where the window consistently opened CenterScreen, the icon in the window&amp;rsquo;s upper left corner was different. Instead of the GP window icon, it was a standard Windows Form icon. This suggested it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a Dynamics GP VST Form but a standard Windows Form. This realization was significant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I then added a second window, this time a Dynamics GP Form, to the test project. I replicated all the window properties from the Windows Form. Upon launching both windows, the Dynamics GP Form opened in the upper left corner, while the Windows Form opened CenterScreen, confirming my suspicions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgNgb0QRjVZq9rnV3lmeLC7QEVApxox1dGi9aXQuMTdoiYQzkdTIQeLZLQlOM5XvQ4_ljPs-7qMp7GkcWghnnxtkerDp8ZgospZzCigtGluwykq3OCUdF5FPI0VgkSrKUrYv-hWdWY3zdwe/s1600/VSTWindowPosition.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

loading="lazy"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This screenshot illustrates the standard Windows Form opening CenterScreen, while the Dynamics GP Form opens in the upper left corner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And if that isn&amp;rsquo;t the most adorable picture ever featured in a Dynamics GP blog post, I don&amp;rsquo;t know what is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It appears that altering the Dynamics GP Form&amp;rsquo;s window Startup Position or Location settings triggers a bug that disrupts proper window positioning, ignoring the set properties. I experimented with various settings, but none reliably replicated the CenterScreen behavior.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After extensive testing, here&amp;rsquo;s what I discovered:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When StartPosition is set to CenterScreen and the Location value is 0, 0, the VS Tools window will consistently open in the upper left corner. It might position correctly initially, but changing the StartPosition or Location setting seems to make it default to the upper left.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Adding code to set the form Location property during the OnLoad event results in the window opening CenterScreen on the first attempt. However, subsequent openings reposition it to the upper left corner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Interestingly, changing the Location to a non-zero value, such as 100, 100, allows the Location property to function consistently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, there seems to be an additional caveat. Based on numerous tests, setting the Location only works if it&amp;rsquo;s the first line in the Form Load event. Any code that refreshes the form afterward will cause the Location setting to be disregarded from the second window opening onward.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To summarize:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Set the form Location property to a non-zero value, like 100, 100.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Add this as the very first line in your Form Load event:&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>this.Location = new Point((Screen.PrimaryScreen.Bounds.Size.Width / 2) - (this.Size.Width / 2), (Screen.PrimaryScreen.Bounds.Size.Height / 2) - (this.Size.Height / 2));&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After hours of testing, I believe these techniques provide a workaround for the VS Tools window positioning bug. Further testing suggests that modifying the Location property might be unnecessary if the Location setting is the first line in the Form Load event.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This issue is new to me, leading me to believe it was introduced in GP 2013 or GP 2013 R2. Its subtle nature makes me doubt it will be addressed soon.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s common to accumulate unused phones after upgrading contracts or switching carriers. Technological advancements and tempting free offers often lead us to replace phones before they&amp;rsquo;re truly unusable. While understandable, this habit results in drawers and boxes filled with neglected devices. These phones quickly lose value and often end up discarded, contributing to electronic waste and releasing harmful substances like lead and cadmium into landfills.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, there&amp;rsquo;s a profitable and responsible alternative. Recycling companies offer cash incentives for trading in used cell phones. These devices are then refurbished and made available to markets where affordability outweighs having the newest model, such as developing countries.&lt;/p>

The unit arrived in remarkably good shape. The dust cover is practically flawless, and the aluminum panels and platter are in fantastic condition.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, there is a hole drilled into the top left corner of the aluminum plate surrounding the platter, meaning this part will need replacement. Thankfully, beneath the plates, the turntable appears to be in pristine, original condition.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This originality is a positive sign, as it usually means fewer unexpected problems during restoration. The turntable has the orange plastic transport lock bushings, which, as expected, disintegrated during shipping. Thankfully, the plinth corners are in perfect condition – a rarity!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Upon plugging in the turntable and pressing start, the carriage moved slowly to the LP setdown point and attempted to lower the arm. This is a good indication of the turntable&amp;rsquo;s overall health. A thorough cleaning and re-lubrication of the carriage and arm lowering mechanism should address the slow movement. This test also showed that the 33 RPM trimmer backlight bulb is out and the carriage pulley is cracked, both relatively easy fixes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, this Beogram 4002 is a great candidate for a complete restoration. With some work, it should return to like-new functionality. Stay tuned for updates on the restoration process!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Shared Internet Service for Apartment Buildings</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/shared-internet-service-for-apartment-buildings/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jul 2024 23:24:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/shared-internet-service-for-apartment-buildings/</guid><description>&lt;p>Property owners and managers are recognizing the increasing importance of broadband internet access, much like essential utilities. They are exploring ways to provide this service, similar to phone and cable companies. Offering high-speed internet can be a significant advantage in attracting and retaining tenants.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Becoming an internet service provider, even for a single building, requires reliable, dedicated internet access. T1 or Dedicated Internet provides this, ensuring the full bandwidth is dedicated to your use, unlike shared services like DSL and Cable. Consumer-grade services often prohibit sharing or reselling, while T1 allows you to share the connection with multiple users within your building.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With T1, you get a professional telecommunications service commonly used by small ISPs. A T1 Router connects to your building&amp;rsquo;s network, serving up to 25 users on a single line. Multiple T1 lines can be combined for even greater bandwidth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each T1 line offers 1.5 Mbps upload and download speeds, unlike services with limited upload speeds. While this may seem moderate, it is often sufficient for most users due to the dedicated nature of the connection. Bonding multiple lines can increase speeds up to 12 Mbps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>T1 service includes a Service Level Agreement (SLA), guaranteeing high availability and quick response times in case of outages. It is a reliable solution widely used by businesses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The cost of providing internet service to tenants can be incorporated into the rent or charged separately. Providing wireless routers and setup assistance can be a valuable amenity for tenants.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>T1&amp;rsquo;s advantage is its availability in areas where DSL and Cable internet are not accessible. It can be installed wherever traditional phone service is available.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The cost of T1 varies based on location and infrastructure. Prices start below $400 per month in major cities. Shared among tenants, the cost becomes very affordable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another option is T1 Integrated voice and data service, combining phone and internet on a single line. This is suitable for buildings requiring both services, with dynamic bandwidth allocation prioritizing internet use when no calls are in progress.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To determine if shared internet access is right for your property, consult with technical experts who can assess your needs and provide suitable options from various T1 service providers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dial-Up is Alive and Kicking</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/dial-up-is-alive-and-kicking/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jul 2024 19:17:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/dial-up-is-alive-and-kicking/</guid><description>&lt;p>In today&amp;rsquo;s world of high-speed internet, it might seem strange to talk about dial-up. Many people consider it outdated technology.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, dial-up internet access is still relevant. Millions of people still use and appreciate it for browsing the internet and checking emails. This &amp;ldquo;outdated&amp;rdquo; technology remains profitable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the main advantages of dial-up is its affordability. Unlimited access is available for a low monthly cost, making it a budget-friendly option compared to DSL or cable internet. The only cheaper option is free internet service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Free internet is accessible in many places, like restaurants with WiFi, if you have a laptop or notebook computer with WiFi capability. Most new computers have this feature, but older computers can be equipped with a WiFi modem for a small price. This allows you to enjoy free internet while having a meal, though you still need to pay for the food.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, relying on free WiFi has its limitations. It is not convenient if you need frequent access to your email or live in an area without readily available WiFi. Traveling or working late at night also presents challenges with relying solely on free WiFi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If any of these situations apply to you, dial-up internet service might be a suitable choice. Most laptops and desktop computers, except for a few exceptions like the thin Apple Air (which has an accessory modem available), have a built-in dial-up modem. If your computer has a phone jack, it likely has a built-in modem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You might be surprised at the capabilities of a 56 Kbps connection. Basic web browsing on text and graphics-heavy sites is possible, and some websites might load slowly even on broadband, making the difference unnoticeable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A personal experience highlighted the usefulness of dial-up as a backup. When a cable internet provider experienced a lengthy service disruption during an upgrade, having a dial-up connection allowed for continued internet access. While broadband-dependent users struggled, those with dial-up could continue their online activities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This situation demonstrates the value of dial-up as a reliable backup option when your primary broadband connection fails. While some providers offer limited free dial-up minutes as a backup, it&amp;rsquo;s not always guaranteed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For those currently using or considering dial-up, exploring options like World Verge Dial-Up Internet is recommended. They provide unlimited access, local numbers, a travel-friendly dialer, spam and virus protection, email accounts, web space, compatibility with various computers, and 24/7 technical support for a reasonable monthly fee.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If faster web browsing is desired, an optional accelerator can enhance page loading speed. While it doesn&amp;rsquo;t affect music or video downloads, it can significantly improve the browsing experience for a small additional monthly cost.&lt;/p>

This innovation allows for WAN connections over copper, achieving speeds up to 500 Mbps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While Gigabit Ethernet is achievable with Cat-6 wiring for LAN connections, this technology focuses on connecting businesses to broadband providers using existing copper infrastructure. This is significant because many businesses require increased bandwidth for various purposes, including server farms, internet access, data transfer between locations, and the growing need for electronic medical record transfers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fiber optic cables offer superior bandwidth but come with high installation costs. Copper wiring, being ubiquitous and already in place, presents a cost-effective alternative. Ericsson&amp;rsquo;s approach leverages multiple copper pairs instead of relying on a single twisted pair. Using six copper pairs, they achieved 500 Mbps over a 500-meter range, enabling connections to nearby fiber-equipped buildings or FTTC boxes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While not a novel concept, Ethernet over copper is already used in metropolitan areas. Ericsson&amp;rsquo;s technology takes it further, surpassing the 50-100 Mbps limitations of current installations. Similar to existing techniques, it employs multiple pair transmission and MIMO analysis to mitigate interference and signal reflections inherent in bundled copper cables.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With anticipated availability by year-end, Ericsson&amp;rsquo;s equipment offers a promising solution for businesses struggling with bandwidth limitations and seeking alternatives to expensive fiber optic installations. Existing copper-based services offer 45 Mbps speeds over a few miles, making this new technology a potential game-changer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>E-Rate Supports Gigabit Internet for Schools &amp; Libraries</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/e-rate-supports-gigabit-internet-for-schools-libraries/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 22:48:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/e-rate-supports-gigabit-internet-for-schools-libraries/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>By: John Shepler&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s evident that broadband internet access is crucial for businesses, education, and individuals. Schools and libraries, in particular, require online access to thrive in today&amp;rsquo;s digital age.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.zazzle.com/educational_poster_keep_calm_and_teach_on-228629492623183844?rf=238447826945304662" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

loading="lazy"
alt="Educational poster | Keep calm and teach on"
>&lt;/a> &lt;strong>Schools &amp;amp; Libraries are Lagging&lt;/strong>
Surprisingly, many elementary schools and libraries lack adequate internet access. They require modern broadband speeds, surpassing the outdated megabit per second standard. Today&amp;rsquo;s requirements necessitate fiber optic connections.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The FCC acknowledges this need, promoting internet speeds of at least 100 Mbps per 1,000 users for schools and libraries, with plans to increase this to 1,000 Mbps. Larger libraries require even faster speeds. The goal is to eventually achieve 10 Gbps per 1,000 students.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>More Funding for Higher Bandwidths&lt;/strong>
E-Rate, the government program providing discounts for internet access, has received a funding boost, increasing from $2.4 billion to $3.9 billion annually. A portion of this funding will support high-speed internet access, while the remaining funds will enhance infrastructure, including Wi-Fi. Support for outdated services like pagers and traditional phone lines will be phased out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>How to Qualify for E-Rate Discounts&lt;/strong>
Schools, school districts, and libraries can apply for E-Rate discounts through the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC). Service providers must also apply and receive a Service Provider Identification Number (SPIN). Many major carriers are already equipped to provide fiber optic broadband connections at various speeds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>How Much Are the Savings?&lt;/strong>
E-Rate offers discounted service prices. Qualifying schools and libraries pay less for broadband access than businesses. The discount is determined by the poverty level and urban or rural status of the population served. Discounts range from 20% to 90%, calculated based on student eligibility for the national school lunch program.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Easy Want to Find E-Rate Broadband&lt;/strong>
While researching local providers or national carriers is an option, using a company specializing in E-Rate services simplifies the process. These companies, working with multiple carriers, can identify E-Rate providers in your area. This service is free, and inquiries are obligation-free.&lt;/p>

Maintaining earnings through cost-cutting instead of increased sales won&amp;rsquo;t be sustainable. When the economy fully recovers, rapid adaptation will be crucial, but increased expenses are only justifiable with increased revenue. Bandwidth on demand offers a solution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bandwidth on demand allows businesses to access and pay for only the bandwidth they currently need, scaling usage up or down as required. This differs from the traditional approach of installing full capacity in advance, which poses financial risks if projected growth doesn&amp;rsquo;t materialize.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bandwidth on demand offers flexibility, allowing businesses to increase or decrease bandwidth as needed. This adaptability is valuable in uncertain economic conditions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Various services, often Ethernet-based, offer bandwidth on demand. Capabilities depend on the provider and existing infrastructure, such as copper or fiber optic cables.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ISDN PRI, for example, can support up to 23 phone lines on a single line. Businesses can start with a smaller number of lines and add more as call volume grows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even T1 lines, offering 1.5 Mbps, can be purchased fractionally, allowing for future upgrades to full capacity or beyond by combining multiple lines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Consulting a bandwidth specialist is recommended to determine the most cost-effective options based on current and projected needs. Free consultations are available through Telarus.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): Installation of New Gold Plated RCA Plugs</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-installation-of-new-gold-plated-rca-plugs/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 17:43:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-installation-of-new-gold-plated-rca-plugs/</guid><description>&lt;p>Replacing the original DIN or RCA plugs is a crucial step when restoring a Beogram 4002. The old plugs often show corrosion due to the lack of gold plating. Upgrading to modern, all-metal plugs with gold-plated terminals is recommended. This upgrade minimizes electromagnetic interference and ensures optimal signal transfer to the amplifier by maintaining low contact resistance, especially important for the delicate MMC20 cartridge signals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The original RCA plugs on a Beogram 4002 (5513) being restored were in poor condition.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They were replaced with high-quality Amphenol plugs featuring a full metal body and plated contacts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The newly installed plugs look excellent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This particular Beogram also had a shortened grounding wire.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s perplexing why anyone would cut cables instead of coiling and securing any excess length. A significant number of Beograms have been found with cut power or output cables. The damaged grounding wire was replaced with a new 16-gauge wire, matching the length of the RCA cables, restoring it to its full functionality.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002: Polishing the Hood</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-polishing-the-hood/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 16:20:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-polishing-the-hood/</guid><description>&lt;p>My work on restoring the 4002 continues, and today involved polishing the hood – a task that&amp;rsquo;s quite a workout!

&lt;p>The veneer corners are flawless, and the internal components appear untouched.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Initial testing showed the turntable powers on and the motor functions, but the arm doesn&amp;rsquo;t lower. This is likely due to hardened lubricant in the arm mechanism, a common issue that can be resolved during restoration. An RPM test will be conducted before working on the platter drive system. The transport lock bushings are deteriorated, but replaceable with custom-designed parts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unique to the 5514 model is a power-on LED in the lower left corner, connected to the main circuit board. The hood, though scratched, can be polished to regain its shine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Beogram included an MMC20EN cartridge in its original box. While the cantilever is slightly misaligned, a common problem with this model, the cartridge still functions and could be used as a spare or repaired.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, this Beogram 4002 presents a fantastic foundation for a complete restoration.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cloud vs Premises Contact Center Costs</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/cloud-vs-premises-contact-center-costs/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 05:11:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/cloud-vs-premises-contact-center-costs/</guid><description>&lt;p>Lots of small businesses can get by with just a local or toll-free number for customer calls. But as companies grow, they usually dedicate staff and resources to handle customer interactions, creating a dedicated department known as a contact center. While contact centers are important, they can be expensive to run. Is there a way to reduce the cost?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.cloudnetworkingservices.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

alt="Find out how much a cloud based contat center can save over the traditional premises approach&amp;hellip;"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Until recently, outsourcing to different locations was an option, but that often led to issues with language barriers and inconsistent service quality. These days, companies highlight their in-house customer service as a competitive edge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So how can businesses make running an in-house contact center more affordable? The key is to lower both setup and operational costs while boosting efficiency. This is where cloud-based solutions come into play.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Traditional contact centers require significant physical infrastructure, including expensive PBX phone systems. These systems can be pricey to maintain, become outdated, and eventually require replacement, leading to a costly cycle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The new approach is to keep your trusted agents but move the technology infrastructure to the cloud. This means no more managing bulky, expensive equipment. Cloud-based contact centers offer the same functionality but with added flexibility and scalability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One leading company in this field is inContact. They provide a cloud-based contact center solution that&amp;rsquo;s much more robust than a basic hosted PBX system. It allows agents to work from anywhere with an internet connection, whether that’s in the office or remotely. This opens up opportunities to hire talented individuals who may not be geographically close to your physical location.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unlike traditional systems with limited capacity, cloud solutions can easily adapt to your needs. If your business experiences seasonal spikes, the cloud can effortlessly scale up to handle the increased call volume and then scale back down during quieter periods.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But is the cloud reliable enough? inContact offers a 99.99% uptime guarantee through its redundant data centers in Dallas and Los Angeles. With six layers of security, your data is kept safe and private. Their background as a telecom carrier means they can also provide reliable internet connectivity, simplifying your setup and support.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How much can you actually save? While it depends on individual circumstances, studies indicate that businesses can achieve 30% lower operating costs with as few as 50 users, and savings can exceed 50% for larger contact centers with 500 users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Interested in learning more about pricing, potential savings, and available features? You might be surprised by the opportunities you&amp;rsquo;re missing.&lt;/p>

It provides dedicated bandwidth at a reasonable cost, making it a reliable choice. However, another service called Ethernet over Copper (EoC) is gaining popularity as a viable alternative.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.copperethernet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;img src="http://www.EthernetOverCopper.co/images/EthernetOverCopperBadge250.gif"
loading="lazy"
alt="Check Ethernet over Copper pricing vs T1 line pricing now."
>&lt;/a>EoC is an Ethernet WAN connection that can connect multiple business locations or provide a dedicated high-speed Ethernet connection. It can also serve as an access point to private cloud networks, including national and international MPLS networks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Both EoC and T1 lines are delivered using existing telephone wiring, known as twisted-pair cabling. Both technologies utilize multiple wire pairs through a process called bonding to increase bandwidth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While they use different protocols and modulation techniques to transmit data, these technical details are generally not a concern for users. The important factor to consider is the amount of bandwidth available at a given price point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In many cases, EoC offers both higher bandwidth and lower prices. This is partly due to the technology&amp;rsquo;s efficiency in transmitting data over copper wiring. Additionally, competitive carriers aiming to establish a market presence often promote EoC, driving down prices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>T1 lines typically provide a reliable 1.5 Mbps per line, which can be increased by adding more lines through bonding. However, bonding beyond 10-12 Mbps becomes less cost-effective, making other solutions like DS3 more suitable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ethernet offers a broader range of bandwidth options, from low speeds of around 1 Mbps to the standard 10 Mbps Ethernet used in LANs, and even up to 45 Mbps. However, EoC has distance limitations, requiring proximity to a carrier point of presence. T1 and bonded T1 solutions, on the other hand, do not face these limitations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For businesses in rural areas or locations where EoC is unavailable, an emerging option called Ethernet over DS1 (EoDS1) offers a solution. EoDS1 utilizes the DS1 data specification used in T1 lines to transport Ethernet, effectively delivering Ethernet over a T1 line using specialized equipment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The best service ultimately depends on your location. To make an informed decision, consider obtaining competitive quotes from providers. Request an &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.copperethernet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

Similarly, today, we&amp;rsquo;re witnessing &amp;ldquo;spectrum renewal,&amp;rdquo; where sections of the radio frequency spectrum are deemed too valuable for older technologies like analog TV and cell phone service, despite their widespread use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This isn&amp;rsquo;t driven by lack of public demand. Millions of analog TV sets and cell phones are still functional. While people desire new technology like HDTV, not everyone can instantly replace existing devices. Analog cell service, vital for systems like OnStar and home alarms, faces a similar fate, leaving users stranded when it&amp;rsquo;s shut down.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The driving force behind this is intense competition for limited spectrum resources. Unlike the past, where new technologies like FM radio and UHF TV coexisted with existing ones, today&amp;rsquo;s demand for bandwidth-heavy services necessitates reclaiming spectrum occupied by older technologies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This mirrors the challenges of dealing with outdated infrastructure. Just as land is finite, usable radio frequency spectrum is a limited resource. The most desirable frequencies, offering high bandwidth and good signal propagation, are in high demand, creating pressure to replace older technologies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While spectrum renewal enables advancements in mobile technology, it has downsides. The potential financial gains from spectrum auctions contribute to the push to shut down analog TV. Similarly, broadband over power line technology could disrupt shortwave radio.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This raises the question: is this progress at an acceptable cost? While necessary for advancements in mobile technology, the challenge lies in minimizing disruptions as we transition away from technologies we&amp;rsquo;ve come to rely on.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Installation of a Neutrik Gold Plated DIN5 Plug</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-installation-of-a-neutrik-gold-plated-din5-plug/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 00:12:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-installation-of-a-neutrik-gold-plated-din5-plug/</guid><description>&lt;p>A common improvement for the Beogram 4000 is replacing the DIN5 plug with a gold-plated version.

>CLEAR is already rolling out its 4G WiMAX network&lt;/a>? If you happen to live in an area where CLEAR WiMAX is currently offered, you can experience internet speeds comparable to DSL or Cable, all without the need for physical wires. They have a range of plans to suit your needs, whether it&amp;rsquo;s for your home, mobile device, or both.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://www.T1Explainer.com/images/4GLogo.gif"

>Now, you might be wondering, what exactly is WiMAX, and how does it stack up against 3G? In simple terms, WiMAX is a globally recognized standard for wireless broadband, often described as WiFi but on a much larger scale, covering entire cities. While there are technical differences between the two, the comparison to city-wide WiFi is a good way to understand its potential uses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The acronym WiMAX stands for &amp;ldquo;Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access&amp;rdquo; and is technically defined by the IEEE 802.16 standard, similar to how WiFi operates under the IEEE 802.11 standard. However, a key distinction is that WiMAX utilizes licensed frequencies and operates at a much higher power level. In contrast, WiFi shares unlicensed frequencies with a variety of devices like microwave ovens, Bluetooth devices, and cordless phones, all of which function at significantly lower power levels. This difference in frequency and power is the reason why your WiMAX connection remains strong even in your car or at home, while a WiFi signal weakens as you move away from its source, such as a cafe or your home network.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Remember when there was a big push to transition from analog to digital television broadcasting? A significant portion of the freed-up airwaves were auctioned off, and Clearwire emerged as one of the major winners. They utilized these acquired channels to offer their CLEAR WiMAX service. Thanks to the lack of signal interference and the strategic placement of powerful transmission towers, WiMAX can cover a significantly wider area, penetrating walls and reaching further distances. To use it, you&amp;rsquo;ll need a modem designed for either a PC or Mac, which connects to your computer or router much like a traditional broadband modem, except it receives its signal wirelessly. A more portable version, resembling a USB flash drive, is also available for laptops, offering mobile connectivity. The beauty of WiMAX is that it provides consistent service throughout the city, even while you&amp;rsquo;re on the move.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You might be thinking: &amp;ldquo;Doesn&amp;rsquo;t 3G cellular broadband offer similar capabilities?&amp;rdquo; You&amp;rsquo;re right, it does. However, WiMAX generally surpasses 3G in terms of speed. This advancement is why it&amp;rsquo;s categorized as 4G, or fourth-generation technology, signifying a step up from 3G. But what kind of speeds can you actually expect with WiMAX? CLEAR advertises average download speeds ranging from 3 to 6 Mbps, with bursts reaching up to 10 Mbps, a speed rarely achieved by 3G mobile broadband.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently, CLEAR WiMAX is accessible in select areas across the US, with plans to expand to more cities soon. The service is most prevalent in Texas, spanning nearly a dozen cities. Beyond Texas, CLEAR is also available in Hawaii; the Seattle-Portland corridor; Boise, Idaho; Chicago, Illinois; Las Vegas, Nevada; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Atlanta and Milledgeville, Georgia; and Charlotte, Greensboro, and Raleigh, North Carolina.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another compelling advantage of CLEAR WiMAX 4G is its affordability. With plans starting at $30 per month, it&amp;rsquo;s often cheaper than many DSL and cable broadband plans and significantly more budget-friendly than 3G cellular data plans. And because it&amp;rsquo;s wireless, you eliminate the hassle of scheduling installations—the equipment is delivered straight to your doorstep, ready for you to set up and activate at your own convenience. No more waiting around for technicians. As a bonus, you can even combine home and mobile service, a feature that DSL and cable providers simply can&amp;rsquo;t match.&lt;/p>

While multiple T1 lines can increase bandwidth, this approach might not be the most cost-effective solution, especially in metropolitan areas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Point-to-point Ethernet offers a compelling alternative, often at a lower cost per Mbps, particularly for higher bandwidth needs. Ethernet streamlines data transmission by maintaining its format throughout the network, potentially allowing locations to function as a single bridged LAN.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This Ethernet connection, known as E-Line service, acts as a direct replacement for traditional T1 lines, forming a virtual Ethernet cable between two points. For those requiring multiple Ethernet services through a single physical connection, EVPL (Ethernet Virtual Private Line) presents a viable option.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When multiple locations need interconnected communication, E-LAN (Ethernet LAN) service provides a meshed network solution, enabling communication as if all sites share a single LAN.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Alternatively, E-Tree service facilitates point-to-multipoint connections, ideal for content distribution from a central source to multiple recipients without user interaction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To determine the optimal Ethernet service for your business, consider comparing pricing and features to see how much you can save.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Farewell, VB</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/farewell-vb/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2024 08:38:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/farewell-vb/</guid><description>&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve been close since I started with programming on my Commodore 64.

>VoIP comparison shopping page&lt;/a>, you can select &amp;ldquo;Business&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Residential&amp;rdquo; as your Plan Type. If you make international calls, choose your most frequently dialed country. You can also check boxes for specific features like &amp;ldquo;No Activation Fee&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Adapter/Router included&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;Digital Phone included.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Clicking the &amp;ldquo;Search&amp;rdquo; button generates a results list within seconds. For example, a search for a business plan including an adapter/router and international calls to the United Kingdom might yield plans from several providers with varying prices and features. Hovering over a provider&amp;rsquo;s name provides a brief description of the plan, while clicking the name or magnifying glass reveals complete details on the vendor&amp;rsquo;s website.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The results page allows you to sort by column, making it easy to compare costs. Clicking on the &amp;ldquo;United Kingdom&amp;rdquo; column might reveal that Phone Power&amp;rsquo;s Freedom Business Unlimited package offers the lowest per-minute rate. You can also sort by other criteria like Service Provider, Plan Name, Monthly Cost, Activation Fee, and Regular Minutes. Once you&amp;rsquo;ve found a suitable plan, click the &amp;ldquo;Order Now&amp;rdquo; link to be directed to the vendor&amp;rsquo;s order page. A link at the bottom of the chart allows you to modify your search criteria and explore other options. This tool simplifies the process of comparing plans and pricing from various providers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Residential users will find a similar experience, with typically more vendors and lower costs than business plans. The option to include an international destination remains, often showcasing surprisingly low international rates with VoIP services.&lt;/p>

However, a new service called Business Ethernet is emerging as a strong competitor, offering comparable performance at a lower cost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.t1rex.com/explainer.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;img src="http://www.EtherRabbit.com/images/BusinessEthernetGrowthChart200.gif"
loading="lazy"
alt="Business Ethernet is Growing. Check prices for your location now."
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Business Ethernet, also referred to as Metro Ethernet, Ethernet over Copper, or Ethernet over Fiber, provides advantages such as scalable bandwidth options, reduced cost per Mbps, and wider availability. Its name emphasizes that Ethernet is no longer limited to Local Area Networks (LANs) and carriers, as it&amp;rsquo;s rapidly being adopted by SMBs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ethernet&amp;rsquo;s strength lies in its position as the universal standard for computer networking. Most desktop PCs, routers, switches, and cabling infrastructures are built to support Ethernet. This widespread adoption, driven by economies of scale, makes it challenging for other technologies to match Ethernet&amp;rsquo;s price-performance ratio.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The dominance of Ethernet has prompted telecom companies to re-evaluate their public networks. While T1 lines, DS3 bandwidth, and OCx services rely on circuit-switched technology initially designed for telephone calls, Ethernet operates on packet switching. As most networks have transitioned to packet switching, it&amp;rsquo;s logical to align telecom networks with this standard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>End-to-end packet switching presents intriguing possibilities. When LAN, Metropolitan Area Network (MAN), and Wide Area Network (WAN) all utilize Ethernet, businesses can implement layer 2 switching to connect multiple locations. This allows each location to maintain its own LAN while being interconnected through MAN and WAN Ethernet services, effectively extending the company network across different sites.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Business Ethernet&amp;rsquo;s scalability allows businesses to order a range of bandwidth options, often referred to as ports. As long as usage stays within the port&amp;rsquo;s capacity, bandwidth can be adjusted in small increments, even as low as 1 Mbps. This flexibility lets businesses acquire the bandwidth they need currently and easily upgrade as their requirements grow, optimizing costs without sacrificing performance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When comparing costs with T1, variations exist depending on location and competition. However, it&amp;rsquo;s not uncommon to find 3 Mbps Ethernet priced similarly to a 1.5 Mbps T1 line. Another popular choice is 10 Mbps Ethernet, which often costs about the same as a T1 line from a previous contract period.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ethernet over Copper stands out by utilizing specialized terminal equipment, installed by the service provider, to combine multiple copper pairs for the telecom connection. This enables bandwidths of up to 50 Mbps over existing copper wiring, eliminating the need for new fiber optic installation. Although T1 lines can also be bonded, their bandwidth is limited to a maximum of 10 or 12 Mbps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ultimately, the best choice depends on the specific needs of your business. Both T1 and Business Ethernet are reliable, professional-grade digital line services. Comparing competitive quotes for both options can help determine which option offers the most significant cost savings.&lt;/p>

So why worry about the small costs involved? Firstly, saving money is always a good thing. Secondly, the more affordable conference calls are, the more you can use them to boost productivity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s examine AccuConference, a leading teleconferencing provider, and see their pricing options. AccuConference offers both flat rate and pay-as-you-go conference calls.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Flat-Rate option is ideal for regular, even daily meetings. The best part of flat-rate pricing is that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to watch the clock, worrying about the cost when someone rambles on. With a flat rate, you pay a fixed monthly fee based on the number of participants you can have on a call. Participants call a 404 Atlanta number and cover their own long-distance charges. Your call can last as long as needed, though people tend to lose focus after an hour or two. After 10 hours, the system automatically ends the call, and you&amp;rsquo;ll need to start a new one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, what&amp;rsquo;s the cost of this flat rate? It starts at $14.95 per month for up to 5 lines on the conference. Of course, people might use speakerphones to include an entire conference room. Five lines are sufficient for most working groups and project teams. But what if your company needs to host larger training calls? For larger groups, you can get up to 50 lines for $199 a month and hold daily conferences if needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>AccuConference also provides toll-free pay-as-you-go conference calls. There are no setup fees, monthly minimums, or contracts. You simply pay for what you use. The cost is a small per-minute charge, usually 7.9 cents per minute per participant. Participants dial a toll-free number, and you cover the call costs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What about international participants? They can also call in toll-free. Their cost depends on their location. For example, calls from Canada cost 9.9 cents per minute, Australia and the UK are 12.9 cents per minute, and Mexico is 32.9 cents per minute. Most of Europe falls under 20 cents per minute.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, compare these costs to travel expenses for in-person meetings. You&amp;rsquo;ll be amazed at how connected you can stay using affordable flat-rate or pay-as-you-go conference calls.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Users successfully importing transactions might find that the associated Analytical Accounting data is missing in GP. This issue often stems from incorrect import procedures and misleading error messages from eConnect. To clarify, this article outlines how to correctly include Analytical Accounting data in an eConnect import.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A thorough review of the eConnect Programmer&amp;rsquo;s Guide section on the &amp;ldquo;taAnalyticsDistribution&amp;rdquo; node is crucial. The guide contains misleading elements and an inconsistency that could cause confusion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s break down some key fields in the help file:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>DOCNMBR&lt;/strong>: This field should reflect the Dynamics GP document number, like the Journal Entry or Voucher Number. In the context of a PM voucher, it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the vendor&amp;rsquo;s invoice/document number.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>DOCTYPE&lt;/strong>: This field differs from the numeric document type value used in the main transaction import. The bottom of the &amp;ldquo;taAnalyticsDistribution&amp;rdquo; help page provides a list of AA DOCTYPE values to use based on the main transaction type.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For instance, when importing a PM Voucher, use the value &amp;ldquo;zero.&amp;rdquo; This contrasts with the DOCTYPE=1 used in the &amp;ldquo;taPMTransactionInsert&amp;rdquo; node.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>DistSequence:&lt;/strong> This field is optional if your distributions have unique GL accounts. When dealing with duplicate accounts in your distribution, provide this value. This usually means assigning the DistSequence value in your transaction distributions to pass them to AA.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>ACTNUMST&lt;/strong>: This represents the GL account number for the distribution line linked to the AA entry. Although marked as &amp;ldquo;Not Required,&amp;rdquo; it&amp;rsquo;s recommended to populate this value. However, if you&amp;rsquo;re already using DistSequence, ACTNUMST becomes redundant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When handling AA distribution values, ensure you&amp;rsquo;re using valid AA dimension and code values. The combination should be valid and compatible with the GL account. This validation process can be tedious during AA data imports, especially if the customer frequently adds AA codes or GL accounts. Validating all AA data before import simplifies the process for the user, as it prevents eConnect errors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Refer to the provided code snippet for importing a GL JE. As long as the AA values are correctly assigned, the process should be straightforward.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project involved creating a RESTful JSON web service that enables a website to seamlessly integrate with Dynamics GP, Authorize.net, and the k-eCommerce/Azox Credit Card Extension. Given its role in handling sensitive credit card data, the web service prioritizes security by incorporating HMAC authentication, AES encryption, and operating exclusively over HTTPS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The customer utilizes an internal website for processing customer orders, gathering customer details, credit card information, and product selections. Previously, customer data was stored separately and manually entered or imported into Dynamics GP. Credit card transactions were managed through a payment gateway with recurring billing features, and all transaction data was entered into GP retrospectively. To streamline operations, the client desired a real-time integration between the website and Dynamics GP, allowing for immediate customer information updates in GP.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the client wished to avoid storing credit card information within Dynamics GP or the Credit Card Extension module, even in encrypted form, opting instead for tokenization. This process involves securely sending credit card data to the payment gateway, Authorize.net in this case, and receiving a unique identifier or &amp;ldquo;token.&amp;rdquo; This token, stored in the Credit Card Extension module, facilitates future credit card transactions within Dynamics GP.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The decision to utilize a RESTful architecture stemmed from the client&amp;rsquo;s website being developed with PHP on Linux, effectively excluding direct APIs like COM and .NET libraries. Given their familiarity with REST and its simplicity for this integration, REST emerged as the preferred choice over SOAP.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The selection of JSON as the data format was driven by the client&amp;rsquo;s developers&amp;rsquo; experience with JSON-based web services, simplifying implementation compared to SOAP or XML-based alternatives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the architectural decisions finalized, the next step involved addressing implementation details, including web service authentication. The client&amp;rsquo;s developer recommended HMAC, a secure and straightforward authentication method that involves hashing the request content combined with a shared secret key. This process generates a unique &amp;ldquo;password&amp;rdquo; that is virtually impossible to forge, ensuring secure request validation on the web service side. The project utilized SHA-256 as the hashing algorithm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To further enhance security, despite employing SSL and HTTPS for the web service, the transmission of credit card data as plain text was avoided. The team opted for AES-128 encryption, which proved more challenging than anticipated. Determining an &amp;ldquo;initialization vector&amp;rdquo; (IV) and navigating the differences in AES implementation between PHP and .NET presented significant hurdles. The team invested considerable effort in researching encryption settings, eventually discovering that PHP defaults to NULL padding, while the chosen encryption library used PKCS7 padding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Future blog posts will delve deeper into each element of this project.&lt;/p>

However, a new option allows for flexible scaling and a pay-as-you-go model: cloud server hosting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Discussions about cloud computing versus managing your own data center are becoming increasingly common. However, many companies haven&amp;rsquo;t reached the stage where investing in a complete in-house data center is necessary. They haven&amp;rsquo;t even considered setting up a server rack for web hosting, email, and other services. This is because outsourcing these tasks to hosting providers has become highly appealing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Small businesses, such as those operated by freelancers, small retailers, and design studios, often start with template-based websites and hosting provided by local web services companies. As they expand beyond the basic &amp;ldquo;brochure&amp;rdquo; website or desire more control over their design and hosting, they often transition to budget-friendly hosting services found online. With hosting plans costing less than $4 per month, there&amp;rsquo;s little motivation to handle everything themselves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How can companies offer such inexpensive hosting while remaining profitable? These low-cost plans fall under the category of shared hosting. While the control panel might give the impression of having a dedicated server, the reality is quite different. Dozens, or even hundreds, of other websites might share the same server without your knowledge. The only indication of shared resources might be occasional slowdowns. If your resource usage becomes excessive, the hosting provider might suggest upgrading to a virtual private server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What exactly is a virtual private server? It bridges the gap between shared hosting and a dedicated server. A dedicated server provides complete control over a physical machine with its processor, memory, and storage. However, this also means bearing the cost and responsibility of managing a potentially underutilized resource. Conversely, needing more resources would require upgrading to a larger dedicated server or a cluster of servers, which can quickly become expensive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>VPS hosting utilizes virtualization software. A single physical server is divided into multiple virtual servers, each functioning like a standalone physical server. Only you and the hosting service are aware that it&amp;rsquo;s a virtual server, not a dedicated one. This shared infrastructure significantly reduces costs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Virtual private servers offer increased resources and full root access, enabling software installation and customization. However, limitations remain due to sharing a physical machine and the challenges of adapting to changing resource requirements.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is where cloud hosting comes in. The principle behind cloud computing is a vast pool of resources, including processors, RAM, hard drives, and bandwidth, managed by a provider. Instead of selling a fixed portion, access to this pool is leased. Similar virtualization principles as VPS hosting apply, but the resource pool is practically limitless. This allows for effortless scaling to meet current needs and easy adjustments as those needs change.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cloud hosting servers provide choices of Linux or Windows operating systems, guaranteed CPU cycles, RAM, and hard disk space, hardware redundancy for reliability, full root/administrative access, a dedicated IP address, automatic nightly data backups, and compatibility with popular control panels like cPanel and WHM. Payment is based on hourly usage, without commitments, contracts, or setup fees. If servers are no longer needed, they can be canceled without penalty.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, which hosting solution best suits your company? It&amp;rsquo;s recommended that organizations compare VPS, collocated private servers, and cloud hosting options, considering both pricing and features, to determine the optimal choice.&lt;/p>

This project required me to access custom fields in modified GP windows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I installed the VS Tools SDK on my GP 2015 server and ran the DAG. However, the DAG would crash during the &amp;ldquo;Generating IL code&amp;rdquo; step.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even after upgrading to the latest hotfix, the issue persisted. My next attempt was to try the RTM version of the VS Tools SDK and GP 2015.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While searching for a solution, I came across forum posts describing a similar problem. The solution involved copying specific DLL files from the GP or AddIns directory to the VS Tools SDK folder. Based on these posts and advice from David Musgrave, I tried copying the BusinessObjects.dll file.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Through trial and error, I discovered that copying three specific DLL files from my GP 2015 folder to the VS Tools SDK folder resolved the DAG crash:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Microsoft.Dynamics.GP.BusinessObjects.dll&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Microsoft.Dynamics.GP.ManagementReporterServices.dll&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Microsoft.Dynamics.GP.Svc.Application.dll&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Although the DAG no longer crashed, it would stall at 99% during the &amp;ldquo;Creating Application.MicrosoftDynamicsGp.dll&amp;rdquo; step. However, it eventually completed after a few minutes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hopefully, this solution proves helpful to others encountering similar issues with the DAG.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update:&lt;/strong> For those experiencing Remote Desktop difficulties with high DPI screens, Nathan Hayden from BKD has a helpful workaround available at: &lt;a class="link" href="http://dynamicsinsights.com/2018/10/05/remote-desktop-high-dpi-dynamics-gp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;em>http://dynamicsinsights.com/2018/10/05/remote-desktop-high-dpi-dynamics-gp/&lt;/em>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Modern Windows laptops and desktops with high-resolution or 4K displays often encounter display issues with some software. These &amp;ldquo;high DPI&amp;rdquo; screens can make text appear minuscule at full resolution. To counteract this, Windows uses &amp;ldquo;scaling&amp;rdquo; to enlarge text and graphics for readability and usability. While the technical aspects are complex, the goal is straightforward: making the system functional.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Windows 10 typically suggests a 200% scaling level for optimal viewing on high DPI displays. However, a 175% scaling might be preferable for maximizing screen real estate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhwSuSyQ-fvtkzAYxl3jr2p8yzKOjFLW3KC4tJdJSgphU7gCQfr5rpsqIZnz_93m_gkcgEknZNj7j2AB-YHwmhUHEdgL2MOkKNC1rf52YX85dbZ5k0p1_cPfHwg76sa4SOgMySNREipsAZn/s1600/Scaling1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Scaling is generally effective, and many applications function seamlessly. Issues become apparent when an application isn&amp;rsquo;t designed to be &amp;ldquo;high DPI aware&amp;rdquo; or compatible. In such cases, display elements appear distorted, as exemplified by SugarSync in the example below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjdOAtMpcXbeep2iU0wgpMrCcUkSIfs1JkoHxng8Rmb32A9FxkJKukQJW85eSFjTUI77IQgVl46wM4k2LnuNW8eGTF61iaRYWOcoLhElnq1A7-Ebw5z8UaJ2zg5cDMiuKDyQ3s1ttN3eutI/s1600/Scaling2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While inconvenient, these inconsistencies are manageable. Dynamics GP 2015 initially seemed to display correctly on a Surface Pro 4. However, recent usage revealed an odd mix of font sizes, a problem also encountered by a colleague.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjUGvCIZZDtt68bnnGEYHEY6b-rKZOwM0ciss-H2pBY3tP3FpcZ2CjuCMOv7-z70Ie8n_pl6rzqZ5uLDdSPMgV_M3o0sxtito0U6JRms4y54H-s1Jm1oz-oOPAbTKGBwTA482rdKAC6j7Aa/s1600/GPBefore1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The menu fonts appear oversized while the left pane text is too small. SQL Server Management Studio 2014 exhibits similar issues on high DPI displays. A search for a solution led to this insightful post:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.sqlservercentral.com/blogs/spaghettidba/2015/10/14/ssms-in-high-dpi-displays-how-to-stop-the-madness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>http://www.sqlservercentral.com/blogs/spaghettidba/2015/10/14/ssms-in-high-dpi-displays-how-to-stop-the-madness/&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The author&amp;rsquo;s grasp of Windows&amp;rsquo; high DPI settings led to a clever fix: modifying the scaling method for specific applications using a manifest file. While the technical details remain unclear, the solution proved effective. Importing a registry key and saving the Ssms.exe.manifest file resolved the display issues in SSMS 2014.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although bitmap scaling at 175% might result in a slightly blurry display, it greatly enhances usability. Adjusting the scaling to 150% or 200% could help if the blurriness is bothersome.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Encouraged by the success with SSMS, the question arose: Could this method work for Dynamics GP?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>(Full credit for this solution goes to &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.sqlservercentral.com/blogs/spaghettidba/2015/10/14/ssms-in-high-dpi-displays-how-to-stop-the-madness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Gianluca Sartori and his article&lt;/a>)&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Creating a Dynamics.exe.manifest file yielded impressive results. Dynamics GP launched and displayed correctly, without any font size discrepancies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjNT1Wtxc8VHvf733D6L51O3nmJvW0cP_6TlM042AeLAnVdsDOuIXEj2F9avu9EI8XUnrZmp8jyhw9lknUwALo9zifEaMUCEEy5xMVOXBP7X_zZUq-FvHl54mShkxTNgmQDjOrsDfmUy3TY/s1600/GPAfter1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Capitalizing on this success, a manifest file was created for SugarSync, successfully resolving its scaling issues. The existing SugarSync manifest file was edited to incorporate the additional settings from the SSMS 2014 example.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While the specific settings within the manifest file remain a mystery, its versatility is apparent, having been successfully applied across three different applications.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Those interested in attempting this fix are advised to proceed cautiously. If you lack experience with registry editing or troubleshooting potential system errors, seek assistance from an expert.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Save the following text as a file named &amp;ldquo;Scaling.reg&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00&lt;br>
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\SideBySide]&lt;br>
&amp;ldquo;PreferExternalManifest&amp;rdquo;=dword:00000001&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Double-click the created &amp;ldquo;reg&amp;rdquo; file to import it into the Windows registry on the machine running Dynamics GP.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, save the following text as a file named &amp;ldquo;Dynamics.exe.manifest&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p> &lt;br>
   &lt;br>
   &lt;br>
 &lt;/p>
&lt;p> &lt;br>
   &lt;br>
   &lt;br>
 &lt;/p>
&lt;p> &lt;br>
   &lt;br>
     &lt;br>
   &lt;br>
 &lt;/p>
&lt;p> &lt;br>
    false&lt;br>
 &lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Place the newly created Dynamics.exe.manifest file in the same directory as the Dynamics.exe file within the GP application folder.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Testing this solution to see if it resolves the small font issues in various GP scenarios would be beneficial. Feedback on its effectiveness is welcomed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>UPDATE:&lt;/strong> It appears that GP 2013 and GP 2015 have different scaling behaviors. GP 2013 exhibits a unique set of font size issues, displaying extremely small window fonts. The Dynamics.exe.manifest file corrected these issues as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>After installing GP 2013 R2, a few changes and new features are noticeable. One notable difference is the redesigned User Setup window.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>GP 2013 SP2:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The R2 window features the noticeable ribbon at the top, a standard change in R2. Additionally, the User Setup window incorporates a few key additions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>User Type:&lt;/strong> This option, offering Full or Limited access, dictates user permissions. A Limited user is restricted to inquiries and reports. Notably, users with the POWERUSER role cannot be changed from Full to Limited access. This restriction applies to the &amp;ldquo;sa&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;DYNSA&amp;rdquo; logins as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Web client user only:&lt;/strong> This option designates the user specifically for the web client. They will then use their Windows account credentials instead of a SQL login.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The window now has two tabs: one for SQL Server Account information and the other for specifying a Windows Account for web client users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, there is a &lt;strong>Home Page Role&lt;/strong> field, which, according to the help file:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&amp;ldquo;Assign[s] the user to a user role. The user role determines the content that is displayed on a user’s home page by default.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This field is currently disabled in the current installation. It is unclear if this is due to missing configuration settings or a future feature.&lt;/p>

He observes that while some customers have complex setups requiring thorough testing, many others have simpler environments where upgrading directly in production might be feasible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Endow acknowledges that GP upgrades in the past were often complicated, necessitating a separate test server. However, he notes that Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s acquisition of Dynamics GP led to a streamlined and more reliable upgrade process. This leads him to question whether a separate test environment and a full test upgrade are still essential, provided appropriate backups and a solid rollback plan are in place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He further inquires about specific factors that might make a test environment more critical, such as the use of third-party modules, customizations, integrations, the web client, on-premise versus hosted environments, and the volume of data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In an update, Endow highlights a point made by Tim Wappat on Twitter: the use of virtual machines for running GP allows for easy backups and cloning, simplifying rollback procedures and the creation of test environments, thereby minimizing the administrative overhead associated with them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>VoIP Without The Internet</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/voip-without-the-internet/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jun 2024 01:22:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/voip-without-the-internet/</guid><description>&lt;p>Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) emerged as an alternative telephone service that utilizes existing broadband connections for both internet and phone services. This allows providers to bypass fees associated with leasing traditional copper phone lines, leading to more attractive bundled packages for customers. Theoretically, the internet&amp;rsquo;s capacity should easily accommodate low-bandwidth voice data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, this isn&amp;rsquo;t always the case in reality. Internet paths, much like highways, can become congested, leading to bandwidth constraints, transmission delays (latency), and dropped data packets, all of which disrupt real-time communication like phone calls.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The primary bottleneck often lies in the &amp;ldquo;first mile,&amp;rdquo; the connection between a user and their provider&amp;rsquo;s network. Shared bandwidth services like DSL and cable internet don&amp;rsquo;t guarantee consistent quality or availability, resulting in fluctuating performance and dropped calls.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While budget-conscious consumers might tolerate such inconsistencies, businesses prioritize reliable communication to avoid customer dissatisfaction and disruptions. Negative experiences with VoIP have led some businesses to avoid internet-based phone systems entirely, while others have found solutions combining the advantages of both traditional and internet phone systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Successful businesses often achieve this by limiting their internet usage to non-time-sensitive tasks like web browsing, email, and data exchange. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessitate outdated phone systems and analog lines. There are two primary methods to benefit from VoIP without compromising quality:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Hybrid PBX Systems:&lt;/strong> These systems utilize IP-based phones and switches within a company&amp;rsquo;s internal network, allowing for the use of a single Ethernet LAN for both data and voice communication. This requires careful network design to ensure smooth voice data transmission but eliminates the need for separate phone lines and their associated maintenance costs. External communication is then handled via traditional phone lines connected to the IP PBX.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>SIP Trunking:&lt;/strong> This involves a dedicated line connecting a company&amp;rsquo;s IP PBX directly to their VoIP provider. This dedicated line, often shared with internet data, ensures voice data quality by bypassing the public internet and connecting directly to the public telephone network via the provider. This guarantees consistent bandwidth availability and avoids competition with other internet users.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Both approaches prioritize quality and control by either connecting directly to the public phone network on-site or through a dedicated connection to the provider. This avoids the unpredictable nature of the public internet.&lt;/p>

Second, a client&amp;rsquo;s Dynamics GP SQL server crashes, you rebuild it, and restore databases from backups.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Both scenarios present a common problem: restoring a database from one SQL Server to another doesn&amp;rsquo;t transfer the associated SQL Server logins.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Scenario 1 offers a solution: a &amp;ldquo;Capture Logins&amp;rdquo; script (KB 878449) efficiently transfers SQL logins to the new server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, Scenario 2 becomes trickier if this script isn&amp;rsquo;t regularly used. You&amp;rsquo;re left with a fresh SQL Server lacking logins, and databases containing unconnected users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This inconvenience can be addressed by a system stored procedure encountered while studying for the SQL 2008 exam:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>sp_change_users_login @Action='Report';&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This procedure, proving useful beyond exam preparation, identifies orphaned users. In a real-world scenario where a rebuilt SQL server required login reconstruction, this command efficiently listed orphaned users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While comparing SQL logins and database users is possible, this command offers a simpler approach. Security-conscious clients may also find it valuable for identifying and removing orphaned users to maintain database integrity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This highlights a valuable, practical SQL exam takeaway applicable to Dynamics GP environments.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: A New Arrival From Massachusetts - First Look</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-a-new-arrival-from-massachusetts-first-look/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jun 2024 19:14:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-a-new-arrival-from-massachusetts-first-look/</guid><description>&lt;p>A Beogram 4000 turntable arrived from a Massachusetts customer for a complete restoration. Thankfully, it was properly packaged and arrived without damage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The turntable&amp;rsquo;s dust cover shows typical signs of use, but it will be replaced with a new one. The aluminum surfaces are in good shape overall.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, there are some minor flaws. The keypad has a corner ding, suggesting it might have come loose during past transportation. Additionally, there are small scratches on the aluminum, possibly from the keypad moving around.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While the arm cover has some scuffs, the lettering is well-preserved, which is a positive sign. The plinth is in excellent condition, with sharp, undamaged corners.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Internally, the turntable appears to be mostly original, showing few signs of previous repairs. This is encouraging for the restoration process. The red carriage position marker is also in good condition.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As expected, the solenoid-actuated switch terminals show oxidation and signs of past attempts to fix them. These terminals will be cleaned, straightened, and plated with nickel and gold for long-term durability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Initial testing showed promising results. The carriage moved correctly, the solenoid activated at the LP setdown point, and the strobe light functioned properly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In conclusion, this Beogram 4000 restoration appears to be straightforward. The turntable is expected to be fully restored to its original appearance and functionality. Updates will follow as the process progresses.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SQL script for verifying Dynamics GP GL batch control totals</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/sql-script-for-verifying-dynamics-gp-gl-batch-control-totals/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jun 2024 10:28:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/sql-script-for-verifying-dynamics-gp-gl-batch-control-totals/</guid><description>&lt;p>A customer encountered a bug in their Dynamics GP integration that caused discrepancies between the actual number of imported GL transactions and the batch control totals. To identify these discrepancies, a SQL query was created to compare the number of GL transactions and JE totals with the batch control totals stored in SY00500.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The query utilizes a Common Table Expression (CTE) to efficiently calculate and compare the data. This approach helps pinpoint differences between the expected transaction count and total amount against the recorded batch control totals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The results are displayed in a table format, highlighting any discrepancies between the transaction count or total amount. These discrepancies are flagged in the &amp;ldquo;CountDiff&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;AmountDiff&amp;rdquo; columns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next step involves developing a SQL script to rectify the incorrect control totals within SY00500.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Upgrade Your Business Image</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/upgrade-your-business-image/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jun 2024 06:47:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/upgrade-your-business-image/</guid><description>&lt;p>Your image as a business professional is largely controlled by your company when you work for a large corporation. However, as a small business owner, independent sales agent, or consultant, you are responsible for managing your own image. One important aspect of this is your business card.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The design and printing of your business card contribute to a polished and professional look, but an unprofessional email address can quickly ruin that impression. Using a generic free email address might be acceptable for personal use, but for a professional, it appears amateurish. Instead, opt for an email address that uses your company&amp;rsquo;s domain name, such as &lt;a class="link" href="mailto:yourname@yourcompany.com" >yourname@yourcompany.com&lt;/a>. This not only looks more professional but is also easier for clients to remember and associate with your business. It demonstrates that you take your business seriously. Consider using a domain name service with email forwarding if you prefer to use your personal email address for business correspondence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A professional email address is affordable, often costing less than $10 per year for a .com, .net, or .org domain name. Ideally, your domain name should match your company name or be closely related. This registration often includes domain name forwarding for your website.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even if your business primarily operates offline, having a website is essential. It acts as a digital brochure, providing contact information and outlining your products or services. With additional effort, your website can become an online sales platform, allowing customers to place orders outside of business hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While free website options exist, it&amp;rsquo;s generally best to avoid them, with a few exceptions. If you represent a company that provides agent websites, these are usually professionally designed and integrated with your agent ID. However, the URLs for these sites are often lengthy and unattractive. This is where URL forwarding is beneficial. By forwarding your purchased domain name to this website, you can direct clients to a professional-looking URL like &lt;a class="link" href="http://yourcompany.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>http://yourcompany.com&lt;/a> instead of the lengthy, default one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another exception to avoiding free websites is a blog. Google&amp;rsquo;s Blogger service offers a free platform where the design and tools are already in place. You only need to focus on creating content. Regularly updating your blog with industry insights or offers keeps it relevant and engaging. If time or budget constraints have prevented you from creating a website, a blog is an accessible and easy-to-manage alternative.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, consider using a toll-free business number. It enhances your professional image and makes it more convenient for potential customers to contact you without incurring call charges. Services like Kall8 offer affordable toll-free numbers for a low monthly fee plus the cost of calls.&lt;/p>

The transition to this modern technology eliminates the need for separate phone and computer networks and allows businesses to move their internal switching system to the cloud. Moreover, switching to IP phones unlocks a wider array of features, often referred to as Unified Communications (UC).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ShorTel, a recognized leader in business communications, is widely used by companies of all sizes. Notably, ShorTel also leads in UC with its ShorTel Connect CLOUD service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s crucial to understand that ShorTel Connect CLOUD is a fully hosted and managed communications solution that removes the burden of phone system management while introducing new features such as instant messaging, video conferencing, desktop sharing, and conference calling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Furthermore, it allows for integration with Customer Relationship Management (CRM) applications like Salesforce and NetSuite, boosting employee efficiency. Automation, a core capability of Unified Communications, presents a compelling reason to upgrade from traditional analog and VoIP systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cloud-based UC offers additional efficiency advantages. Instead of upfront capital expenditures, businesses opt for a pay-as-you-go monthly billing model based on the number of users. While this might seem like an even trade-off at first, it becomes particularly beneficial when scaling up or down operations. Adding new employees simply requires adding more users to the existing system without significant capital investments in a new PBX mainframe. Similarly, during economic downturns, resources can be easily adjusted to align with a smaller organizational structure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These arguments are analogous to those used for cloud computing, and for a valid reason: the cloud functions similarly regardless of the hosted application. Essentially, voice communication becomes another application on the cloud, with the critical distinction that real-time audio and video streams necessitate special prioritization to ensure quality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reliability and security are paramount concerns with cloud-based systems. ShorTel addresses this by delivering enterprise-grade performance backed by robust Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and easily accessible customer support as part of its managed service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If your business phone system feels restrictive and you&amp;rsquo;re seeking productivity gains and cost savings through cloud-hosted Unified Communications, explore what ShoreTel Connected CLOUD can offer.&lt;/p>

Prior testing had shown that the arm carriage would not return to its home position when moved across the platter without a record in place. Instead, it would travel to the center of the platter and stop. Ideally, the carriage should trigger the End Switch (ES) at this point and subsequently return to its home position on the right, turning off the turntable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My initial focus was to ensure the proper operation of the carriage position switches, considering their critical role in the smooth functioning of this model. While not overly complex, I felt a video demonstration of the process would be beneficial to fellow enthusiasts working on this elegant design.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Despite cleaning the switches, the carriage run issue persisted. Upon closer examination, it became apparent that the spring responsible for activating the ES switch was not fully engaging. I removed the spring carrier again and slightly bent the spring downwards to increase the switch travel. This adjustment resolved the problem, enabling the carriage to return to its home position when moved across an empty platter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, further testing revealed a potential issue where the carriage could be manually positioned in a way that would not trigger the ES. This occurred when using the left arrow on the keypad to move the carriage beyond the ES activation point, seemingly overriding the ES function. As a result, the ES would release, preventing the carriage from returning when the arrow key was released.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To address this, I repositioned the ES activation spring slightly to the right on the carrier plate. This adjustment allows the carriage to reach its physical endpoint using the arrow key without moving beyond the ES switch&amp;rsquo;s activation zone.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): New Gold Plated RCA Plugs</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-new-gold-plated-rca-plugs/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jun 2024 01:11:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-new-gold-plated-rca-plugs/</guid><description>&lt;p>Over time, many Beogram devices have developed corroded DIN or RCA plugs. It&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to replace these old connectors with new, gold-plated ones. This specific Beogram 4002 (5513) came with RCA connectors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj0tFhVjbqM56QEUoPej-XLqsKUy-1W68A3AXYtjR37S-tnlsnW593WMhscIX_A_4XK55ZGe5nv0VVGnY2VLDCfsT580fjHuc-2FcFNvX6rS916NIai5q1Ec6O63SaDb2bgszWa2rnHBck/s1600/Beogram&amp;#43;4002&amp;#43;original&amp;#43;RCA&amp;#43;plugs-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I typically use large, modern, high-quality metal plugs for replacements. However, this project had a unique requirement: the Beogram needed to connect to a Beolab 5000. The Beolab 5000 has a compact compartment for its connectors, which creates limitations on plug size.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I chose gold-plated, all-metal Rean plugs that were short enough to fit the Beolab&amp;rsquo;s compartment. However, these plugs, like many others, have oversized cable exits. While this might accommodate the recent trend of using very thick cables, I find this excessive and prefer a cleaner look. To address this, I designed small 3D-printed inserts that would create a more streamlined appearance and provide a way to color-code the plugs.&lt;/p>

Users frequently encounter BCP utility errors after successfully launching utilities and logging in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A quick fix is to launch Dynamics GP Utilities as an administrator. While this is straightforward, I&amp;rsquo;ve observed a concerning trend of simply recommending the disabling of user account control altogether. This approach raises concerns for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I strive for respect when collaborating with client IT support, acknowledging they have priorities beyond Dynamics GP. Disabling user account control feels like an IT decision, not one for a Dynamics GP consultant like myself. I can offer my perspective, but taking action blurs the lines of responsibility.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do you share this view? Is my reaction disproportionate to a minor annoyance? It&amp;rsquo;s akin to altering permissions on shared or local drives without direct IT collaboration—something I&amp;rsquo;m hesitant to do. Am I overreacting?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I welcome your perspectives.

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note:&lt;/strong> This post documents an outdated method. There&amp;rsquo;s a simpler way to remove the drive that doesn&amp;rsquo;t involve lifting the Pre-Amplifier board or disconnecting the solenoid linkage. See my &lt;a class="link" href="http://beolover.blogspot.com/2014/10/beocord-5000-47154716-replacing-belts.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>later post&lt;/a> for the updated procedure.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Following advice from &amp;lsquo;chartz&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;sonavor&amp;rsquo; on Beoworld.org (&lt;a class="link" href="http://forum.beoworld.org/forums/t/9839.aspx?PageIndex=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>link to thread&lt;/a>), I began replacing the belts in my Beocord 5000 (4716), which had become loose and stretched over time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first step is removing the drive mechanism. This involves lifting the left-side board to access the solenoid linkage. As &amp;lsquo;chartz&amp;rsquo; recommended, I secured the operating panel to the enclosure&amp;rsquo;s bottom using three screws in reverse orientation. This clever trick prevents damaging the wires while working with the exposed components. Here&amp;rsquo;s a picture:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhXFPTNf-VhswMi-AB-NqAhyYkntpk8g9G_NHgP1tb2gGqH-d8JKqQt5NHjdIRtd4vhb5-p321-Bx7PPSDaJYx-8kvM0xnGKeXP2dcHcVuAFWlshOea6BQUsxdFCDJXappkmmPvHU76-Ppc/s1600/Key&amp;#43;panel&amp;#43;secured.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

loading="lazy"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, I flipped up the left-side board. This board is secured by two screws: one in the back right corner and another beneath the enclosure next to the red DIN socket. With the screws removed, I carefully shifted the board to the right, disengaging it from the two brackets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Conveniently, there are two upward-facing slots on the brackets where the board can be secured in an upright position. I recommend covering the plexiglass cover with a cloth to prevent scratches, a precaution I hadn&amp;rsquo;t taken in the following picture as I was still learning:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhl6BOLOF5GMWySTM6nN9G8J1PRFbJXGleKmVw_gxqOir4i7H5JcVdaEhJQKqtHjD0IPCRvsnC7NOudPeqhBSG3mTrgaQxii5Hu2o12xaTrSHYfYUvuh_qMP5i-x8THvS7agT36uQ0KKLga/s1600/Left&amp;#43;Board&amp;#43;Flipped&amp;#43;Up.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

loading="lazy"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With that done, it was time to extract the drive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, I removed the solenoid linkage:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg6EI0f3O5hKsRAOv5POoVT_7wY0IvQzsuUJW44-p62fDiOHI7my_OwG0KriAQIab06HXD9daM81Gtiniw1u_LbGJC21E87nZBNYhJv-M7_pu83KTTy6v9ktx27zvUK3bb3oPWYJ0pSV2yF/s1600/Solenoid&amp;#43;Linkage&amp;#43;with&amp;#43;Retaining&amp;#43;Ring.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg6EI0f3O5hKsRAOv5POoVT_7wY0IvQzsuUJW44-p62fDiOHI7my_OwG0KriAQIab06HXD9daM81Gtiniw1u_LbGJC21E87nZBNYhJv-M7_pu83KTTy6v9ktx27zvUK3bb3oPWYJ0pSV2yF/s1600/Solenoid&amp;#43;Linkage&amp;#43;with&amp;#43;Retaining&amp;#43;Ring.jpg"
loading="lazy"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This required removing the retaining ring from its pivot shaft. I used a retaining ring tool, but it was tricky as the ring sits flush. By gently prying the ring open with the tool and wedging a small screwdriver between the ring and the linkage, I was able to raise the ring enough to get a better grip and remove it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the ring removed, the linkage could be rotated 90 degrees and taken out:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgIPXL9Eh7Yc8ro4y92t1lACyQFGRZtcA61JZdfJ6MQEfuVuePeSUyFGA3ZnXVeiIw-2V8pD85zJhsUzLpgs7vPUyB52ooPbPQGsqy1VdS4vP0gH4v6uzBXp_p53GyD6mVeSWqBR8YTyYXM/s1600/Removing&amp;#43;Linkage.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

loading="lazy"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next step was to disconnect the head plug, ensuring the deck was unplugged to avoid magnetizing the heads. This precaution was advised on a barely visible warning label inside the operating panel - a classic example of how not to design warnings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjXICaeRWiiCe6SWrJZdc3JniKl5t2_b1O3n4yIQWUgNPAUTXbcOo5d6spwWMql5AAHcISNE6N3WF4u42Ywsk4_I6PN4WpOpwKZpmN_xhPCvYmrsne7Rr_z8ARVB8eaIletUhcODlAY5NWM/s1600/Taking&amp;#43;Plug&amp;#43;to&amp;#43;Heads&amp;#43;Out&amp;#43;%28unplug%2Bthe%2BBC%2Bto%2Bavoid%2Bmagnetization%29.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

loading="lazy"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following that, I desoldered the solenoid connections:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhJVtrz6n_ae1peIVNKGo870m4rBmVbciE91QdgZKEQqwg5eW6ZsdgjwdPE6cAgaX4Vuc0ydbPxMofUx1ZFa4kJb-HKbDOAnxCjiaku8o27RMkV3QlANriRl-p6iRyenzjhafTTTAiAhYQe/s1600/Wire&amp;#43;Connections&amp;#43;to&amp;#43;Solenoid.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

loading="lazy"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The drive is secured at the front by two screws that go up through the enclosure&amp;rsquo;s bottom into the solenoid bracket. Here&amp;rsquo;s a view from under the enclosure:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjmR4DaOY4s9AyuOweWZvF4nHnrf32LMpauLNr5-b1TAHSMtt5IxZcoUp1kCR8SuI-eUjUK_zU00IR635b4ntfS4NjBUMYIUnwqETO0os9OYqpA3CBliXdSWCc-DnHG4XneUPTrk73TGhSq/s1600/Screws&amp;#43;That&amp;#43;Hold&amp;#43;Solenoid.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

loading="lazy"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I loosened these screws to allow the drive to slide forward.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unlike the front, the drive&amp;rsquo;s rear isn&amp;rsquo;t secured with a screw. Instead, a bracket on the drive slots into the enclosure. By sliding the drive forward, it can be lifted out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The final step involved disconnecting the large wire connector at the back of the drive:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhHM0UdYKqQrWVUFmBjanuJP9EtkuQP8S99qOk59HQxxKdppZPHEKrb1PxddE3DU3LLpz7WqCvED2kSzSR4E4cbX0iEOurY5uAq2ZacX1ZnQVujOXxXAwZ6xbdRWt_E7wFROvTzNrAk_lbj/s1600/IMG_3378.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

loading="lazy"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This connector was quite firmly seated, and I had to carefully pry it loose with a small screwdriver before pulling it downwards. I realized then that removing the plexiglass cover would have made this easier. Finally, it came loose, and the drive was free.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s a picture of the removed drive:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiq4nr2Sv-H540WadCdHoBiWmxGqeLQExR59Z1ihnwOJwwdyx7bFSmmjeuVn6haJRxCM6H0rYSJPH2HPOakjBJf6Jdr1p7BTe29NTOHBaKmHQKTKElIx5e5flAf1CqPJf34tz6w1g41WqRP/s1600/Drive.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

loading="lazy"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And the enclosure without it:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjJRXFq8yzv63rhp1DlaHUs7gENx19Rt7nl2HCdXl94K61FzzHNR5McFFAIdrF6prnHzJqANJi6zr92M4pJx_RiEegoqdp7KmckNeyY44ANZGh1xbE5HeLSrViyIyjCEhd5x5dD7I_LjGxh/s1600/After&amp;#43;Removing&amp;#43;the&amp;#43;Drive.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That concludes today&amp;rsquo;s work. Next time, I&amp;rsquo;ll begin disassembling the drive mechanism to access the belts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Is Metro Ethernet Available?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-metro-ethernet-available/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2024 03:18:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-metro-ethernet-available/</guid><description>&lt;p>When your company needs more bandwidth, you might wonder about your options. Metro Ethernet is a popular choice, often providing more bandwidth for less money than traditional telecommunications services. But is it available in your area?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.ethernettoday.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;img src="http://www.EthernetToday.com/images/ShopForEthernetBox200.gif"
loading="lazy"
alt="Click to enter your building address and get a map for Ethernet services."
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can easily check availability using an Ethernet service finder to view a map of &amp;ldquo;lit&amp;rdquo; buildings nearby. A lit building has active fiber optic service, meaning the fiber optic cables are installed and operational with active laser light. In contrast, dark fiber refers to installed but inactive fiber optic cabling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lit buildings offer quick and easy access to fiber optic service. The infrastructure, like digging trenches and installing fiber cables, is already in place. Connecting you to the vast bandwidth available through fiber is a relatively simple process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If your business is located in or can relocate to a lit building, you&amp;rsquo;re almost guaranteed access to Metro Ethernet at a competitive price. Sharing a high-bandwidth connection with other tenants presents an opportunity for even lower costs and high-volume usage. But what if your building isn&amp;rsquo;t currently serviced by fiber optics? Can you still get Metro Ethernet?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s a good chance you can. If a neighboring building has fiber, extending that service to your location is usually straightforward. Most of the heavy lifting, like laying fiber from the carrier&amp;rsquo;s Point of Presence (POP) to the building&amp;rsquo;s telecom room, is already done. Extending the fiber next door is a relatively minor task. In fact, you might even get this service for little to no cost if you commit to a reasonable bandwidth level.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What happens if there&amp;rsquo;s no fiber optic infrastructure in your vicinity? That scenario is trickier, depending on your location and bandwidth requirements. You might be surprised to learn that Ethernet operates on both twisted pair copper telephone cables and fiber. Not every business needs Gbps data speeds. Popular Metro Ethernet services offering 3 Mbps and 10 Mbps are easily delivered through existing copper cable infrastructure. This means you can be miles away from the nearest POP and still have access to Ethernet over Copper. While speeds up to 45 Mbps are possible, they necessitate a closer carrier POP for those higher bandwidths.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Is Metro Ethernet available in remote areas? It&amp;rsquo;s unlikely, as the &amp;ldquo;Metro&amp;rdquo; designation suggests. However, you might have options like EoDS1 (Ethernet over DS1), which utilizes T1 lines to provide Ethernet service. Ordering a single or multiple bonded T1 lines, depending on your bandwidth needs, is also a possibility regardless of your location.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To determine if Metro Ethernet is an option for your business, enter your business address (residential addresses are not applicable) into the &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.ethernettoday.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Shop For Ethernet WAN Search box&lt;/a>. The resulting map reveals the proximity of lit buildings to your location. Telarus consultants can then provide you with availability and pricing for Ethernet and other telecom services. You might find your location qualifies for a wider array of services and lower prices than you anticipated.&lt;/p>

Small businesses can buy systems from local stores, while medium-sized businesses often work with contractors for key telephone systems or small PBXs. Larger companies may have internal teams that handle complex telephone systems. Nowadays, hosted VoIP is a cost-effective option for companies of all sizes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.enterprisevoip.com/usa/BusinessPhoneSystems/business_phone_systems.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;img src="http://www.CloudNetworkingServices.com/images/BusinessPhone250.jpg"
loading="lazy"
alt="Check out the advantages of hosted VoIP solutions for your company&amp;hellip;"
>&lt;/a>How can one solution meet the needs of different-sized businesses affordably? It&amp;rsquo;s not a one-size-fits-all solution but a scalable technology adaptable to different demands—hosted VoIP, also known as hosted PBX or cloud telephone systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The cloud metaphor illustrates its nature. It involves using a large data center designed for business telephony for multiple clients. Its cloud service characteristics include significant scalable capacity and virtualization, ensuring client isolation. Billing follows a pay-as-you-go cloud model. The service provider invests in infrastructure, operation, and maintenance, while clients pay monthly per user.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hosted VoIP usually offers telephone services comparable to advanced PBX systems. It includes call switching, in-house calls, local calls, and domestic long distance for a single price. International calls are billed separately, like traditional calling plans.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One benefit of hosted solutions is connecting multiple business locations. This setup helps avoid toll charges for interoffice calls. However, it involves network convergence and running SIP trunks between PBX systems. By bypassing traditional telephone companies, you become your own provider within your company locations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hosted VoIP providers manage a virtual PBX cloud. Each location connects to this cloud through your network. The cloud acts as a central hub, regardless of the handset&amp;rsquo;s physical location. These network devices can connect for conference calls.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hosted VoIP now allows sharing external lines across locations. Internal calls stay within the network (&amp;ldquo;on-net&amp;rdquo;), while external calls require PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network). Traditionally, each location had a PBX with dedicated outside lines, resulting in potential line availability issues. With a hosted solution, PSTN trunks reside in the cloud, accessible from any location, optimizing usage. Not all providers offer this, so inquire about this cost-saving feature if needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve established that hosted VoIP offers advantages like scalability, pay-as-you-go pricing, no upfront investment, and no maintenance. It also connects multiple locations with advanced PBX features. Many providers integrate mobile phones for easy access. Some even include new desk phones in their service plans.&lt;/p>

For those unfamiliar, the System Password in Dynamics GP (found under Administration Page &amp;gt; Setup &amp;gt; System Password) safeguards all system menus (Setup, Cards, Reports, etc.) with a password. This means users need to enter the password to access these windows, even if they technically have permission.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgEnuOn7QCBcZNx1QyPuS5uDlpmzF21xcunBZtNFcK3fiUkl0Sjg-vfa7clHihScn0W-uq1qklZHJVFsmal5aJ4_ql_Os6A4tbkvqpix9Si4_1A0tBp1m8ogEsFYlEbPFzOZHG4BRD32Bhl/s1600/SystemPassword.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

loading="lazy"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This feature was particularly beneficial in older Dynamics GP versions where security was optimistic, granting all users initial access to all windows. Implementing the System Password provided a quick security layer for these settings. However, its usefulness has diminished over time due to several factors:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>While the System menu houses critical windows, many equally important and potentially vulnerable windows reside within module-level setups, routines, and utilities. A comprehensive security setup is crucial for complete system protection.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The System Password offers an all-or-nothing approach. If a user only requires access to specific windows, like exchange tables or Smartlist options, the password acts as a barrier.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The password itself is relatively easy to recover. Someone with sufficient knowledge could potentially uncover it, even without access to the setup window.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Relying solely on the System Password can create a false sense of security for administrators. While it may seem like the system&amp;rsquo;s most vital aspects are locked down, this might not be the case. Even with the introduction of pessimistic, role and task-based security in Dynamics GP (where users initially only have login access), many continue to use the System Password as a simple extra check. This practice isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily problematic if robust security measures are in place, including control over windows accessed through security menus. However, if your security strategy doesn&amp;rsquo;t account for the points mentioned above, relying on the System Password as your primary defense is strongly discouraged.&lt;/p>

These distinct classes got me thinking about the elements of exceptional training and what makes it truly valuable. I&amp;rsquo;d love to share my thoughts and hear yours!&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Relevant Content:&lt;/strong> It&amp;rsquo;s crucial for training content to align with student needs. While this can be challenging with pre-determined classes, instructors can bridge the gap by connecting content to real-world scenarios. Students, too, play a role by actively sharing their experiences and insights.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Collaborative Learning:&lt;/strong> Learning becomes much more dynamic when students actively participate and share their experiences. While the instructor guides the discussion, genuine understanding blossoms when students connect and learn from each other.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Practical Application:&lt;/strong> Knowing the &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rdquo; is important, but the true value lies in understanding &amp;ldquo;how&amp;rdquo; to apply knowledge in practical situations. Instructors can facilitate this by sharing their own experiences and encouraging students to do the same, extending learning beyond the classroom. I personally find it incredibly rewarding when students share their post-training successes.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Full Engagement:&lt;/strong> Everyone involved - both the instructor and students - needs to be fully present and engaged for a training to be truly effective. Instructors should create an environment that welcomes diverse perspectives, while students should actively participate and contribute their unique viewpoints. A knowledgeable and well-prepared instructor who can go beyond the textbook is essential.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m eager to hear your perspectives on what constitutes excellent training, students, and instructors! Share your thoughts!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Managed Hosting PBX Gets You Out Of The Telephone Business</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/managed-hosting-pbx-gets-you-out-of-the-telephone-business/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2024 08:00:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/managed-hosting-pbx-gets-you-out-of-the-telephone-business/</guid><description>&lt;p>A lot of businesses find themselves managing their own phone systems simply because they need phones to operate, even though it&amp;rsquo;s not their core business. This has become the norm, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be this way anymore.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Companies previously invested in extensive phone systems because the productivity gains from each employee having a direct line outweighed the costs. In the past, a single phone line sufficed, but with the information age, constant communication became essential, driving the need for dedicated telecom departments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These departments manage the PBX system, essentially a smaller version of a phone company&amp;rsquo;s central office. It connects internal calls and manages external lines. This setup requires constant upkeep, including replacing faulty phones, rewiring, and managing employee changes, all adding to the cost of doing business.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The financial burden includes managing these daily changes and the capital expense of the equipment. PBX systems are costly, and upgrades can necessitate loans for significant replacements. However, there&amp;rsquo;s a more efficient alternative: hosted PBX.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hosted PBX shifts the responsibility of managing the system to a third-party provider. This eliminates the need for on-site equipment and frees up your resources. With this setup, employees can enjoy the same, if not better, phone functionality, often with &amp;ldquo;smart&amp;rdquo; phones integrated with the computer network.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is possible due to the widespread use of company computer networks. Phones now use the existing broadband network to transmit data packets, connecting to a service provider who manages everything remotely. This makes them more efficient and cost-effective. It&amp;rsquo;s essentially a return to &amp;ldquo;telephone as a service,&amp;rdquo; or in today&amp;rsquo;s terms, &amp;ldquo;voice as a service.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If your company is stuck managing its phone system, it&amp;rsquo;s worth exploring managed PBX hosting solutions. You might find a better and more cost-effective option for your business needs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): Restoration of the Main PCB and Installation of a Biasing Trimmer for TR3</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-restoration-of-the-main-pcb-and-installation-of-a-biasing-trimmer-for-tr3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2024 07:52:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-restoration-of-the-main-pcb-and-installation-of-a-biasing-trimmer-for-tr3/</guid><description>&lt;p>After getting the Beogram 4002 (5513) operational again, I focused on fully restoring the main PCB. This involved installing a trimmer to correctly calibrate TR3, the transistor responsible for amplifying the signal from the record detection sensor. The board&amp;rsquo;s condition upon arrival is shown below:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjXOqjOgkJ-FtoySUGToDWrR71S0sUKp1ijcBHli2w1Tgt0C2_l0PEj100D1Ep0XWPoN3HuRAE2n8k2DiLm_U4duf1Da6BcDbwT1HGwAxjYAW_9EN1CDYotMpj41kUj1mR-gXXb93F3TK4/s1600/Beogram&amp;#43;4002&amp;#43;PCB&amp;#43;partially&amp;#43;restored.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The RPM relay and trimmers had already been replaced by the owner. I finished the restoration by replacing all electrolytic capacitors&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgufhkbIfOxWsjL5Ap9mbPJfENXaJ6F5eyPwjp0oXQMQJVrQIf0-FfSGWVVQDNvKnV9Q-83ckLPlqmtHUPZfxPTe9WmcikJAH_tpPwG769LMwdzLyv38hraCQmGG3Y5O2SeAs4AGY4o2fA/s1600/Beogram&amp;#43;4002&amp;#43;recapped.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>and adding a trimmer to enable bias adjustment at the base of TR3. To make adjustments with the board powered on, the trimmer was temporarily placed on the back, as pictured here:&lt;/p>

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After adjusting the collector DC voltage to 4.0V, I fixed the trimmer to the component side:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEha66-bLtDmE4UWz2E1SsZ5KfWr3QN1OlXF_TxS62Q0BduXA2oP02H-jUAMKyz7KsuRbYsxZ59qep1bHj22IJomB1sSjE8yWTti-JcFz_soqZW_8JHJZWq308qU_OLcaX6s74auHrrGRNw/s1600/Beogram&amp;#43;4002&amp;#43;installation&amp;#43;of&amp;#43;TR3&amp;#43;biasing&amp;#43;trimmer.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The original design used a fixed resistor, often causing insufficient amplification due to inconsistencies in the TR3 transistor&amp;rsquo;s current gain. Adequate amplification is crucial to avoid needle damage if the turntable is accidentally started without a record in place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, I improved the installation of the replacement reservoir capacitor assembly, which had been installed previously:&lt;/p>

Here&amp;rsquo;s what happened:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>I created two SQL views based on GP and custom tables.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I granted the SmartList Builder access to these views (Tools &amp;raquo; SmartList Builder &amp;raquo; Security &amp;raquo; SQL Table Security).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I created my SmartList (Tools &amp;raquo; SmartList Builder &amp;raquo; SmartList Builder).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>After testing, the SmartList worked correctly.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I deployed the views to the client&amp;rsquo;s environment.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I exported the SmartList Builder settings to an XML file.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I imported the XML file into the client&amp;rsquo;s system.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I granted access to the views for SmartList Builder at the client site.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When trying to view the SmartList, an error appeared: &amp;ldquo;You do not have security privileges to view all of the tables used in this SmartList.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Following KB Article #967731, I configured a Security Task and Security Role to include &amp;ldquo;Smarlist Builder\Smartlist Builder Permissions\Smartlist Builder\View Smartlists with SQL Tables.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The error persisted.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I granted DYNGRP SELECT permissions on both views.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The error remained.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I ran Grant.SQL.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The error still occurred.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Frustratingly, this error affected both regular users and the &amp;lsquo;sa&amp;rsquo; account. The solution? Permissions must be set &lt;strong>before&lt;/strong> importing the XML file. While I haven&amp;rsquo;t confirmed the minimum steps, ensure steps 8, 12, and 14 are completed before importing. To be safe, I recommend steps 8, 10, 12, and 14.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After setting permissions and then importing the XML, everything worked perfectly. It seems permissions set after import aren&amp;rsquo;t fully recognized.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy holidays!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Users of Forecaster and Dynamics GP</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/users-of-forecaster-and-dynamics-gp/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2024 04:32:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/users-of-forecaster-and-dynamics-gp/</guid><description>&lt;p>Have you ever encountered a problem where you vaguely recall a solution but can&amp;rsquo;t seem to locate the specific article or link? This happened to me recently with a client attempting to use their Dynamics GP user ID for Forecaster 7.

Websites, software, and files continue to grow larger, but unfortunately, technology budgets haven&amp;rsquo;t kept pace. Imagine doubling your internet speed without increasing your current expenses – an appealing proposition, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you agree?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.ethernetbuildings.com/usa/Ethernet3/ethernet-3mbps.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

alt="Get 3x3 Mbps Ethernet over Copper for the same price as T1. Click to check availabilty and prices."
>&lt;/a>It might sound illogical to suggest that doubling your internet speed wouldn&amp;rsquo;t cost more, especially since internet providers aren&amp;rsquo;t known for giving things away for free. The secret lies in adopting newer, more cost-effective technology instead of simply replacing your existing service with an identical one from another provider.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One way to double your internet speed with your current or a new provider, while retaining your T1 line service, is to order a second T1 line and &amp;ldquo;bond&amp;rdquo; it with your existing line. Bonding combines two lines to function as a single, faster line. A single T1 line provides 1.5 Mbps, so bonding two lines results in a speed of 3 Mbps. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, there are a couple of limitations. First, both T1 lines must be from the same provider, either your current one or a new one for both lines. Second, your monthly cost will double since you&amp;rsquo;re now paying for two lines. While you might find a different vendor offering lower prices for the same service, this alone likely won&amp;rsquo;t get you 3 Mbps for the price of 1.5 Mbps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead of simply doubling down on T1 lines, consider switching to Ethernet over Copper. Both are dependable business-grade internet services with dedicated bandwidth. They can also be managed services, where the provider handles all the necessary equipment at your location to connect to their lines and your network. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another similarity between bonded T1 lines and Ethernet over Copper is that they both utilize the existing copper telephone wires already installed in your building. Although the signal types differ between T1 and Ethernet lines, they function the same way from a user&amp;rsquo;s perspective. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>The key difference lies in the cost. Ethernet over Copper, being a newer technology, utilizes the bandwidth capacity of copper lines more effectively. As a result, its pricing is very competitive, currently about half the cost of two bonded T1 lines. This means you could obtain a 3 Mbps Ethernet over Copper service for the same price as a 1.5 Mbps T1 service. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few other distinctions exist as well. T1 lines can only be upgraded in increments of 1.5 Mbps per bonded line. Ethernet, on the other hand, offers more flexibility, with bandwidth options ranging from 1 Mbps up to 10 Gbps, though higher speeds necessitate fiber optic cables. However, unlike T1, Ethernet over Copper has limited availability, primarily found in larger cities and suburbs rather than rural areas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Interested in doubling your internet speed without increasing your costs? Check pricing and availability for 3 x 3 Mbps Ethernet over Copper or other Ethernet bandwidth services to discover potential savings in your area.&lt;/p>

Many companies are discovering that environmentally friendly practices can save them money. These eco-conscious choices benefit both the planet and their bottom line.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the first areas to examine is electricity consumption. Power usage can be deceptive because it often occurs in small, unnoticeable increments. Every desktop computer, even when idle, contributes to the overall energy use, measured in watt-hours and kilowatt-hours. While electricity costs are easily offset by profits generated from productive work, the issue arises during idle time. Even when computers are unused, they still consume power, leading to unnecessary expenses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many companies have adopted a policy of shutting down computers and monitors overnight and during extended periods of inactivity. This practice has been proven to generate significant savings without significantly impacting equipment lifespan. In reality, most computers become obsolete before they wear out from use. When disposing of old electronics, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to recycle responsibly, as circuit boards and CRTs contain hazardous materials. Proper recycling prevents these toxins from polluting the environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Turning off equipment when not in use, ideally with a mechanical switch that cuts off standby power, offers two advantages. First, it directly reduces the device&amp;rsquo;s power consumption. Second, it minimizes heat generation. No electronic device is perfectly efficient; some energy is always lost as heat. While essential for operation, this heat can become excessive, especially in server rooms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Server rooms, with their concentrated computing power, often require substantial cooling. As equipment density increases, so does the need for air conditioning, creating a cycle of escalating energy consumption. To address this, designers are focusing on more efficient power supplies and even exploring DC power distribution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, maintaining an on-site server room might not always be the most practical solution. Colocation facilities offer a compelling alternative by distributing power and environmental control costs among multiple users. Additionally, colocation often provides access to more competitive bandwidth pricing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For businesses looking to further minimize their reliance on grid power, generating their own electricity is an option. Office buildings and factories often have large, unused roof areas suitable for solar panel installation. By feeding into the grid, these solar arrays can significantly reduce daytime power consumption, especially during peak pricing hours. Google, among other companies, has already embraced solar power to supplement its energy needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re considering upgrading to more energy-efficient computing equipment, consider consulting a network of value-added resellers. These experts can help you find the best deals on servers and network devices that can contribute to both environmental and financial savings.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When choosing a business location, consider &amp;ldquo;lit buildings&amp;rdquo; for their exceptional connectivity. These buildings are already equipped with fiber optic internet infrastructure, offering a solution to bandwidth concerns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.gigapackets.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;img src="https://GigaPackets.com/images/CityLightSkyscraperGreen.jpg"
loading="lazy"
>&lt;/a>&lt;strong>What Does &amp;ldquo;Lit Building&amp;rdquo; Mean?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Lit building&amp;rdquo; signifies a building pre-wired for fiber optic internet and potentially point-to-point bandwidth services. The term &amp;ldquo;lit&amp;rdquo; references the laser beams used to transmit digital signals at high speeds through fiber optic cables.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Advantages of Fiber Lit Buildings&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In today&amp;rsquo;s business landscape, seamless electronic communication is essential, from small enterprises to large corporations. If your operations depend on computers, connectivity is crucial. Even the smallest businesses require internet access for credit card processing, online orders, email communication, and website management. Operating offline can hinder business growth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, securing reliable internet access can be challenging when moving into a new facility. Standalone buildings or being the first tenant often means bearing the cost and effort of installing internet service, including cabling, termination equipment setup, and provider coordination.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lit buildings eliminate these challenges because the costly and time-consuming infrastructure is already in place. Simply contract with the building&amp;rsquo;s fiber optic provider, connect your router to their termination point, and your business is online.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Services Offered in Lit Buildings&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fiber optic connections surpass traditional landlines and cable internet by offering practically limitless bandwidth. While technical limitations exist, advancements in modulation and multiplexing techniques continually increase the bandwidth capacity of a single fiber strand, with speeds of 10 Gbps readily available and 100 Gbps becoming increasingly common. For larger businesses requiring even higher bandwidth, fiber optic cables can combine hundreds of individual strands.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The services available in lit buildings are comprehensive. Ethernet over Fiber, directly compatible with most Local Area Networks (LANs), is a popular choice offering scalable bandwidth from 10 Mbps to 10 Gbps and beyond. Many providers grant users portal access for on-demand bandwidth adjustments. Traditional Synchronous Optical Networking (SONET) services like OC3 to OC48 might also be available and can be demultiplexed to provide traditional T1 line or Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) PRI phone service. Additionally, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) trunking for Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and dedicated cloud connections are typically standard offerings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Why Not Opt for Fiber?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fiber optic internet provides a transparent and future-proof bandwidth solution that effortlessly scales with business growth. The primary drawback is the cost, which can be prohibitive for small businesses and limited budgets. In such cases, business cable broadband offers a more budget-friendly option. If cable infrastructure is available at your location, you can access shared bandwidth up to 1000 Mbps at a competitive price, often without installation charges. Importantly, cable internet availability is independent of whether a building is equipped for fiber.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When considering relocation, prioritize your current and future bandwidth needs. Before committing to a lease, verify the availability of lit building fiber optic services and cable broadband.&lt;/p>

Anything more would be asking too much.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course, this applies to storing digital files, not physical ones. Don&amp;rsquo;t show up at a self-storage facility with boxes of papers expecting free storage – they won&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to show you the door!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead, try storing your computer files for free with Mozy (&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1726600-10430547%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1726600-10430547)&lt;/a>. Simply create an account, download their storage application, and start uploading your documents, photos, music, or any other files from your computer. It&amp;rsquo;s completely free, so no credit card is needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Storing your files remotely offers peace of mind. Hard drives can crash, files can be accidentally deleted, and viruses are an ever-present threat. If you&amp;rsquo;re concerned about the security of your files on someone else&amp;rsquo;s server, rest assured that Mozy prioritizes security. They use 128-bit SSL encryption during file uploads and 448-bit Blowfish encryption for storage, effectively keeping hackers at bay.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another advantage of Mozy is its automation. Set your preferred backup schedule, and the system handles the rest. No more manual backups or worrying about lost or damaged backup disks – Mozy remembers so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing to note is that the free Mozy file backup service (&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1726600-10430547" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1726600-10430547&lt;/a>) for home PCs offers 2 GB of storage. This might be sufficient for many, but if you need more space, unlimited backup is available for a small monthly fee.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Businesses also have a dedicated solution. Mozy Pro (&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1726600-10430553" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1726600-10430553&lt;/a>) provides desktop and server licenses for a low monthly fee, plus a small charge per GB of storage used each month. Compare this to the cost of maintaining your own backup hard drives or the time and effort spent burning CDs or DVDs. Remember that offsite backups are crucial – if your backups are stored in the same location as your primary data and disaster strikes, you risk losing everything.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Moreover, Mozy Pro can help businesses and organizations comply with HIPAA privacy and security regulations, if applicable. You can find helpful information on this topic on the Mozy Pro website (&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1726600-10430553%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>The perfect network connection is invisible. Whether it uses copper wires, coaxial cable, fiber optics, or wireless technology, if it impacts your network traffic, it&amp;rsquo;s not truly transparent. The more noticeable these limitations become, the more they hinder productivity, demanding your attention.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.zazzle.com/caution_low_bandwidth_poster-228502953481307038?rf=238447826945304662" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>&lt;/a>&lt;strong>Artificial Limitations&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Shared broadband services like Cable, DSL, 4G Cellular, or satellite internet, despite promising &amp;ldquo;best effort,&amp;rdquo; are inherently limited by technology and company policies. Each type has a maximum capacity, typically accessible round-the-clock, except for rare outages. However, users only get a fraction of this capacity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Firstly, bandwidth is capped. You&amp;rsquo;re purchasing a maximum speed, not a guaranteed one. Providers control this with rate limits. Your line might support 1000 Mbps, but you&amp;rsquo;re restricted to 10, 30, or 100 Mbps, regardless of other users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Secondly, usage limits are imposed, especially on wireless and satellite connections where bandwidth is costly. Limits like 5 or 10 GB per month severely restrict usage, and even 20 or 50 GB might be insufficient for regular business operations. Exceeding this limit can result in extra charges, disconnections, or slower speeds for the remainder of the billing cycle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Actual Limitations&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Private and dedicated internet connections usually avoid artificial limitations. These premium services ensure you&amp;rsquo;re the sole user, eliminating the need for usage policies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, technical limitations persist. Every technology has inherent constraints. &amp;ldquo;Unlimited&amp;rdquo; bandwidth is a myth, even on local networks. The goal is to have sufficient bandwidth to avoid reaching capacity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>T1 Line Saturation&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>T1 lines, offering dedicated connections between two points or to the internet, have been the business standard for decades. As the sole user, there are no usage restrictions, and the line constantly allows data transfer. You utilize and pay a fixed price for a portion or all available capacity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>T1 lines offer 1.5 Mbps bandwidth, more precisely 1.544 Mbps. However, 8 Kbps is reserved for line synchronization, leaving 1.536 Mbps for actual data – equivalent to 16.59 GB daily or nearly 500 GB monthly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Line Saturation Problems&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Your T1 line reveals its limitations when transferring large files quickly or accommodating multiple users simultaneously. With a maximum capacity of roughly 17 GB daily, transferring even 1 GB per hour becomes challenging.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Attempting to exceed this limit slows down everyone&amp;rsquo;s traffic significantly. This bottleneck hinders productivity, especially when access to information is crucial for continuing work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The situation worsens with cloud-based phone systems (VoIP). Voice data gets stuck in the bottleneck alongside other data, causing call quality issues like garbled speech, delays, and even dropped calls.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Solutions&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For occasional saturation, prioritizing traffic can be beneficial. Real-time services like calls and video conferences get top priority, followed by business applications, and finally, background tasks like backups.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ultimately, upgrading to higher bandwidth becomes necessary. Fortunately, costs have decreased significantly. Doubling your bandwidth with a second T1 line is an option. These lines can be &amp;ldquo;bonded&amp;rdquo; to act as a single, faster connection.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ethernet over Copper, using existing copper lines, offers speeds of 10 Mbps and beyond. For these speeds, Ethernet over Fiber becomes cost-effective, scaling from 10 to 100, 1000, and even 10,000 Mbps. These services allow you to start with a lower speed and pay less until full capacity is needed.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="no-more-clicking-cancel">No More Clicking &amp;ldquo;Cancel&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update:&lt;/strong> Victoria Yudin accurately pointed out that posting reports are sometimes useful or even necessary, for example, in training or when troubleshooting errors. She&amp;rsquo;s absolutely right - posting reports are definitely needed in certain situations, even in Fabrikam. I personally disabled posting reports in my testing environment because I frequently run repetitive tests on batch posting for my projects. I already know that my data, transactions, and postings are all accurate. So, in my case, I don&amp;rsquo;t need the posting reports or the dialog boxes, and I turn them off to avoid constantly clicking &amp;ldquo;Cancel.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a little disheartening to be aware of exactly how many times you have to click &amp;ldquo;Cancel&amp;rdquo; on the report dialog boxes after posting a certain Dynamics GP batch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My desire to avoid this repetitive clicking finally outweighed my laziness in disabling the reports. I finally took 10 seconds to write a script to disable all posting reports in Fabrikam:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>UPDATE TWO..SY02200 SET PRNTJRNL = 0&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And that&amp;rsquo;s it. Done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now I need to make this a standard step in my GP installation process after creating the Fabrikam company.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Batches and posting reports&amp;hellip;two relics of the ERP world that GP will likely never leave behind&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Have you found that your internet service, once reliable, can no longer keep up with your growing business? If a slow connection is impacting productivity and increasing frustration, it&amp;rsquo;s time for an upgrade. But what are your options?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.fibernetworkquotes.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;img src="https://www.fibernetworkquotes.com/images/ThinkingQuestion300.jpg"

alt="Should you get fiber optic Internet? Check your options now."
>&lt;/a>&lt;strong>More Choices, Less Cost&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Shopping for internet access may seem daunting, especially if your last experience was limited and expensive. You might have settled for a T1 line, DSL from the phone company, or business cable from your TV provider. Fortunately, the landscape has evolved.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The good news is that the options have significantly expanded and become more affordable. While T1 lines are still available, often at a fraction of the cost from years ago, they are still limited to 1.5 Mbps. This might suffice for the smallest businesses but will likely cause bottlenecks for most others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A more modern choice is Ethernet over Copper. Using existing telephone lines, this technology offers speeds from 1 Mbps to 15 or 20 Mbps, at approximately half the per-Mbps cost of a T1 line.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Business cable internet has also improved. With advancements in modem technology, speeds of 100 Mbps, 300 Mbps, or even 1,000 Mbps are achievable over existing coaxial cable. You might even find 1,000 Mbps service for the price of your old T1 line. However, keep in mind that cable internet bandwidth is shared, meaning speeds can fluctuate throughout the day. Upload speeds, in particular, are typically much slower than downloads.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>How About Fiber?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For many years, fiber optic internet was only accessible to large corporations. This is no longer the case. Thanks to technological advancements, particularly the shift from SONET to Ethernet over Fiber, prices have dropped significantly, and options have multiplied. Now, businesses can customize their bandwidth from 10 Mbps to 10 Gbps, paying only for what they need and easily scaling up as their needs grow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ethernet over Fiber offers speeds up to 100 Gbps, with high reliability, dedicated connections, symmetrical upload and download speeds, and easy scalability. This service is readily available from a growing number of providers actively expanding their networks. Depending on your location and the level of competition, you might even benefit from reduced or waived construction costs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>I Want Fiber. How Do I Get It?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Choosing fiber optic internet is rarely a decision businesses regret. Unlike older copper-based technologies, fiber is largely future-proof and minimizes issues like latency, packet loss, and jitter, providing the seamless connection you desire.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The easiest way to get started is to work with a bandwidth broker like Telarus. They hold contracts with numerous providers nationwide and can connect you to services around the world. You&amp;rsquo;ll pay the same or potentially less than going directly to a carrier, with the added benefit of comparing multiple options.

But what exactly does it mean and how do businesses acquire them?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unlike standard phone numbers automatically assigned with landline, VoIP, or cellular services, toll free numbers require a separate process. In the US and Canada, phone numbers follow the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) format: 1-NPA-NXX-XXXX.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this format, &amp;ldquo;1&amp;rdquo; represents the country code, NPA stands for Numbering Plan Area (area code), and the remaining digits are unique to your line. The area code often indicates a geographical location, although VoIP providers can manipulate this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Toll free numbers utilize specific area codes called toll free prefixes. While the term &amp;ldquo;toll free&amp;rdquo; implies free calls, it actually means the calling party doesn&amp;rsquo;t incur charges for the call. The owner of the toll free number is responsible for the cost of incoming calls.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To obtain a toll free number, businesses can order them from specialized companies. There are typically two payment options: a monthly fee plus per-minute charges for incoming calls, or a fixed monthly fee regardless of call volume.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Easily recognizable by their prefixes (800, 888, 877, 866, 855), toll free numbers are not tied to specific phone lines. Instead, you assign a &amp;ldquo;ring-to&amp;rdquo; number, directing incoming calls to any phone line you choose.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The popularity of toll free numbers has led to the introduction of multiple prefixes beyond the original 800, all functioning identically.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Hyper-V virtual machine running Server 2012 R2 is unable to start and displays an error message stating "We were unable to finish the updates.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-hyper-v-virtual-machine-running-server-2012-r2-is-unable-to-start-and-displays-an-error-message-stating-we-were-unable-to-finish-the-updates/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jun 2024 18:22:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-hyper-v-virtual-machine-running-server-2012-r2-is-unable-to-start-and-displays-an-error-message-stating-we-were-unable-to-finish-the-updates/</guid><description>&lt;p>By Steve Endow&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While attempting to set up the GP 2016 Web Client on a new Server 2012 R2 virtual machine, I encountered an error message stating &amp;ldquo;We couldn&amp;rsquo;t complete the updates. Undoing changes.&amp;rdquo; The VM became unresponsive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After some searching, I came across a TechNet forum thread discussing similar issues with Windows 8. Unfortunately, the suggested fix of disabling Secure Boot on the VM was unsuccessful in my case.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I eventually found a blog post by Andy Parkes that offered a solution: installing roles and features directly onto a VM&amp;rsquo;s VHD file using Server Manager. This method was new to me and proved to be effective.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following the instructions, I was able to resolve the initial issue, and the VM began applying updates. However, the update process stalled at 100%. I waited a while, but there was no indication of progress.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I decided to power down the VM, disable Secure Boot again, and restart. This time, it displayed &amp;ldquo;Undoing changes&amp;rdquo; for a few minutes before finally booting up with a &amp;ldquo;Preparing Windows&amp;rdquo; message.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, even after successfully booting, Windows Update still displayed a significant number of pending updates.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cheaper Connections To The Cloud</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/cheaper-connections-to-the-cloud/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jun 2024 15:19:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/cheaper-connections-to-the-cloud/</guid><description>&lt;p>Businesses are often quick to celebrate the cost savings of cloud services compared to maintaining their own data centers. However, there&amp;rsquo;s a hidden cost that often catches them off guard: cloud connectivity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.ethernetovercopper.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;img src="http://www.CloudNetworkingServices.com/images/CloudServicesCostB200.jpg"
loading="lazy"
alt="Check the cost of connectivity to the cloud before you make the big move."
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The current cost of bandwidth depends on a company&amp;rsquo;s blend of LAN, MAN, and WAN traffic. Businesses with data centers located in the same building as their employees usually find most of their application traffic stays on the LAN. While a dedicated broadband internet connection is necessary for external communication, a moderate line speed can accommodate a large number of users if their usage is limited to email and web browsing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>E-commerce, however, is a different story. If customer and external user traffic dominate, a high-bandwidth connection is crucial for public-facing servers. In such cases, WAN traffic may even exceed LAN traffic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Similarly, offsite but local data centers, even those primarily used for backup, recovery, or data mirroring, require high-bandwidth connections. This scenario often results in the majority of bandwidth being used by MAN rather than LAN or WAN.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The transition to the cloud significantly alters this dynamic. With public servers becoming rented services, bandwidth costs are absorbed into the service fee, potentially eliminating the need for a MAN connection altogether for cloud storage users. What becomes essential, however, is a significantly larger bandwidth pipe between the company&amp;rsquo;s premises and the cloud service provider.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Companies accustomed to in-house operations might be surprised by the increased cost of private line services to the cloud, potentially offsetting their anticipated savings. Conversely, companies currently burdened by high internet bandwidth costs may find relief in the cloud provider&amp;rsquo;s inclusive bandwidth to the internet. Creating a simple chart comparing LAN, MAN, and WAN bandwidth needs for both current and cloud-based setups is a worthwhile exercise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Regardless of the resulting bandwidth mix, maximizing value for money is key. Fortunately, there are now more options than ever before, driven by competition and technological advancements.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One such advancement is Ethernet over Copper (EoC). EoC directly rivals traditional and high-bandwidth T1 lines, and in some cases, even fiber optic services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Utilizing existing copper telephone wiring, EoC employs a more efficient modulation scheme than T1, achieving higher bandwidths. Unlike T1, EoC is distance-sensitive, requiring proximity to a telco office, making it suitable for urban and suburban areas but less so for rural locations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>EoC bandwidth options typically range from 2 to 20 Mbps, with some metropolitan areas offering services equivalent to 45 Mbps DS3. There are even providers offering 100 Mbps bandwidth over copper.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The pricing for EoC services is particularly attractive. 2-3 Mbps Ethernet service can often be acquired for the price of a T1 line, and discounts of 50% or more compared to traditional telecom services for higher bandwidth EoC are not uncommon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Whether planning a move to the cloud or seeking to reduce current line service costs, exploring &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.ethernetovercopper.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>pricing and availability of EoC and other bandwidth services&lt;/a> could reveal pleasant surprises.&lt;/p>

Unemployment is still high, companies are focusing on cost-cutting over revenue growth, and uncertainty about the future persists. Consumers are tightening their belts and spending less, leaving businesses with little choice but to do the same. It&amp;rsquo;s understandable to hesitate before making significant moves when the path ahead is unclear.&lt;/p>

alt="Deal effectively with the down economy."
>Does this mean your business is stuck or in irreversible decline? For most, that&amp;rsquo;s an overly pessimistic outlook. However, you&amp;rsquo;re presented with a crucial decision, particularly regarding telecommunications expenses. Should you aim for the same level of service at a reduced cost, or maintain your current budget while enhancing your services?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many managers view this as a win-win situation. No matter your choice, you benefit. The only one at a potential disadvantage is an overpriced service provider who is either indifferent to your needs or hasn&amp;rsquo;t optimized their own operations to provide you with a better deal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A prudent first step is to carefully evaluate your company&amp;rsquo;s requirements for the upcoming year. Do your current services align with your needs, or do you require adjustments? For instance, if your phone lines aren&amp;rsquo;t constantly busy, reducing the number of outside lines could be a wise decision. Similarly, downsizing might mean your broadband capacity exceeds your current needs. Aligning your telecom services with your present situation can lead to substantial savings. In certain cases, integrating your telephone and broadband services through options like a T1 line or SIP trunk could yield even greater savings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You might worry that reducing bandwidth could pose a risk if business activity suddenly surges. Scalable bandwidth services like Metro Ethernet can mitigate this concern. You could have a connection with a 50 Mbps capacity while only paying for 10 Mbps. If your needs double, a simple call to your provider can instantly upgrade your service to 20 Mbps without any hardware changes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Certain businesses are well-positioned for growth, but face obstacles like limited loan availability or reluctance to commit to long-term expenses that might become burdensome if anticipated growth doesn&amp;rsquo;t materialize. However, it&amp;rsquo;s possible to enhance your services without increasing spending. This often applies to companies locked into outdated leased line service agreements, paying high prices while remaining unaware of more cost-effective options. Telecom service rates have experienced significant declines in recent years, yet many providers don&amp;rsquo;t proactively offer better deals to existing customers.

What if you could save significantly on your monthly telecom bills without compromising quality? This might be easier than you think.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This article assumes your business uses at least a T1 line for phone and/or internet, which is common for most businesses beyond small offices or home setups. While many companies rely on traditional telecom providers, they may not be the most cost-effective option anymore.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The telecom market has transformed with the emergence of regional and national carriers increasing competition. Tools like GeoQuote (tm) make it easy to compare quotes from multiple carriers, driving prices down.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another major shift is the move from traditional networks to newer technologies like MPLS and Carrier Ethernet. Competitive carriers often excel in these areas as they are not burdened by outdated infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, what cost reductions are we talking about? T1 line prices have dropped significantly, potentially costing half of what your current contract demands, especially in competitive metropolitan areas. Even more impressive are the savings when comparing Ethernet to older DS3 or OCx services for bandwidth. Switching to Ethernet can cut bandwidth costs by 50% or more if your building is equipped for fiber optic service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This convergence of increased competition, improved search tools, and advanced technology offers significant cost savings without compromising performance or reliability. Dedicating a few minutes to exploring these options could lead to substantial annual savings for your company. Compare your current expenses by obtaining an instant online service quote.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Our consultant team can provide you with the most up-to-date special offers and services not yet available through the GeoQuote tool. Request a call to receive this additional information.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Noah Sanders, who wrote &lt;em>Born-Again Dirt: Farming to the Glory of God&lt;/em>, is hosting another one of his &lt;em>Redeeming The Dirt&lt;/em> conferences in Alabama.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Brian Oldreive, the founder of &lt;em>Foundations For Farming&lt;/em>, will be speaking at the conference. &lt;em>Foundations For Farming&lt;/em> is a Christian ministry based in Africa that teaches people, mainly the poor, how to become self-sufficient through growing their own food. I&amp;rsquo;ve written about &lt;em>Foundations For Farming&lt;/em> several times on my previous blog. You can read one of those posts &lt;a class="link" href="http://thedeliberateagrarian.blogspot.com/2014/05/gold-potatoes-in-zimbabwe.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since we&amp;rsquo;re talking about &lt;em>Foundations For Farming&lt;/em>, I want to suggest a YouTube video that features Johann van der Ham discussing the &lt;em>Foundations For Farming&lt;/em> method. It&amp;rsquo;s one of my favorites. At the 4:39 mark, Mr. van der Ham delivers a beautiful two-minute monologue of awe and admiration for a sunflower, and it never gets old.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s so much beauty in this flawed world, if we only open our eyes to see it. Mr. van der Ham concludes by asking, &amp;ldquo;How magnificent will it be when God makes all things new?&amp;rdquo; This is a question for those of us on our own Upland journeys to contemplate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Returning to the &lt;em>Redeeming The Dirt&lt;/em> Conference&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Joel Salatin, the renowned farming expert, will also be present. I probably don&amp;rsquo;t need to introduce you to Joel, but I will mention that he&amp;rsquo;s written a new book that I highly recommend. You can find my thoughts on it here: &lt;a class="link" href="http://thedeliberateagrarian.blogspot.com/2016/05/its-down-to-earth-theological-tour-de.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>It sounds like it&amp;rsquo;s shaping up to be a fantastic event. I encourage you to consider attending. Noah mentioned that readers of this blog can get a 20% discount on registration by using the promo code &amp;ldquo;upland20.&amp;rdquo; However, you must register before the end of August to take advantage of the discount.

&lt;p>Just to be clear, I don&amp;rsquo;t earn any commission when you pre-register using that code. I&amp;rsquo;m promoting this conference because I believe it&amp;rsquo;s a worthwhile event.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I won&amp;rsquo;t be attending myself, unfortunately. Noah extends an invitation every year, but traveling to Alabama is too difficult for me at this point in my life.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Scale Into Toll Free Number Service</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/scale-into-toll-free-number-service/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jun 2024 01:37:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/scale-into-toll-free-number-service/</guid><description>&lt;p>You might be considering toll-free numbers for your business, but the cost and commitment feel like a gamble.

&lt;p>While I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with eConnect integrations extensively, I recently encountered a situation where I needed to update existing Dynamics GP Note records. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t recall having done this before, and online searches didn&amp;rsquo;t provide any solutions. If you know of an easier approach, please share, as I&amp;rsquo;m curious if I&amp;rsquo;ve overlooked something.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s imagine your .NET eConnect integration needs to update a customer&amp;rsquo;s address and phone number, and simultaneously append an update message to the existing customer note. Seems straightforward, right?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, using the eConnect taUpdateCreateCustomerRcd NOTETEXT field overwrites any existing customer note. Despite exploring documentation and searching for ways to programmatically update existing GP notes, including standard zDP and eConnect &amp;ldquo;ta&amp;rdquo; stored procedures, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any direct methods. While the SY03900 note table itself is simple, a more convenient way to update notes would be beneficial.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You could create a single SQL stored procedure, but I wanted to avoid adding another custom procedure for this client.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another option is an eConnect Post procedure, but I find them cumbersome. They resemble custom stored procedures, which I wanted to avoid, and often need to be recreated after GP service packs or upgrades, making them easy to forget.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyway&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, ensure the customer record exists in the SY03900 table. While new customer records are automatically assigned a NOTEINDX value, a corresponding record in SY03900 isn&amp;rsquo;t automatically created. Trying to update the note for customer ACME001 in SY03900 without an existing record will fail.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I created a quick SQL snippet to check for an existing Note record and create one if needed:&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;p>This update script adds a new line to the note, appending new text at the end.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using this approach, after updating the existing customer contact information in GP with eConnect, you&amp;rsquo;ll need a separate method for the note update.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This example specifically addresses updating customer notes. However, it can be adapted for vendor and other note types. With some effort, you could potentially create a more abstract solution for updating notes across different record types.&lt;/p>

This involves nanowires covered in zinc oxide that transform mechanical energy into electrical energy, illustrating the scientific principle of energy conversion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The creator of this innovation suggests incorporating it into clothing like shirts and shoes to power devices like iPods or medical implants. Currently, the power density is 80 milliwatts per square meter of fabric, but this could increase significantly in the future, potentially reaching several watts per garment, especially with more vigorous movements.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While using this technology to charge an iPod while walking is appealing for reducing carbon emissions, imagine the possibilities of recharging hybrid cars at stoplights or even powering homes. The implications for energy independence and environmental protection are significant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Taking this further, envision wearable integrated circuits woven into clothing, similar to electric blankets. By combining existing miniaturized wireless technology with power-generating fabric, clothing could become mobile WiFi nodes, creating a dynamic network that fluctuates with people&amp;rsquo;s movements and activities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This mesh network could provide widespread wireless broadband coverage, addressing the power supply issues of traditional methods. The network&amp;rsquo;s strength would vary throughout the day, peaking during work and school hours and adapting as people change clothes and move about.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Within this network, individuals become walking power sources, routers, and communication hubs. Clothing could even integrate network voice features, essentially becoming &amp;ldquo;softswitches&amp;rdquo; for making calls over the Internet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Expanding this concept, even animals could contribute to broadband coverage. Imagine large animals with their considerable surface area acting as mobile transmitters, extending network access to remote areas and underserved populations. However, the logistics of outfitting certain animals with such technology present a challenge.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>EV-DO Expands In The Face of WiMAX</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ev-do-expands-in-the-face-of-wimax/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jun 2024 23:06:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ev-do-expands-in-the-face-of-wimax/</guid><description>&lt;p>The arrival of 4G technology, specifically Sprint&amp;rsquo;s nationwide WiMAX network, raises questions about the future of 3G. While WiMAX boasts speeds up to 70 Mbps, suggesting a potential shift, the reality is more nuanced.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sprint&amp;rsquo;s commitment to a national WiMAX network, with its impressive 31-mile range and 70 Mbps bandwidth, signals a potential shift in mobile technology. Realistically, users can expect speeds around 2-4 Mbps, especially when mobile. This rivals the current leading 3G service, EV-DO.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Developed by Qualcomm, EV-DO, short for &amp;ldquo;Evolution - Data Optimized,&amp;rdquo; is a standard for CDMA cellular transmission. It provides internet access and video on demand alongside traditional voice services. Major carriers like Verizon (BroadbandAccess and VCAST) and Sprint (Amp&amp;rsquo;d Mobile) have embraced EV-DO.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>EV-DO, with download speeds of 2.4 Mbps and upload speeds of 153 Kbps, is comparable to DSL, cable, and satellite internet. Users typically experience 400-700 Kbps download speeds, sufficient for multimedia messaging, email, web browsing, and video/audio downloads.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>EV-DO evolved from 1xRTT, offering speeds of 60-80 Kbps. While faster than dial-up, it struggles with bandwidth-heavy applications. This evolution is crucial as 1xRTT remains prevalent on CDMA networks, with EV-DO still being deployed beyond major cities and airports.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>EV-DO Rev A, a backward-compatible upgrade, boosts peak download speeds to 3.1 Mbps and upload speeds to 1.8 Mbps. It also introduces Quality of Service (QoS) support, reducing latency for applications like push-to-talk, instant messaging, and potentially VoIP, although carriers remain cautious due to existing voice services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As Sprint and Verizon upgrade to EV-DO Rev A, the next iteration, Rev B, is on the horizon. Launching next year, Rev B enhances performance to 4.9 Mbps per channel, with up to 15 channels working concurrently for a theoretical 73.5 Mbps download and 27 Mbps upload speed. Importantly, it maintains backward compatibility with previous versions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This similarity between Rev B&amp;rsquo;s 73.5 Mbps and WiMAX&amp;rsquo;s 70 Mbps begs the question: is 3G evolving into 4G? In a sense, yes. Verizon, lacking independent WiMAX licenses, benefits significantly from this evolution. Ultimately, this bandwidth expansion paves the way for wireless applications previously restricted by limited airlink channels.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Traditionally, businesses have faced a trade-off between expensive, high-performance WAN bandwidth and affordable, but unreliable, low-performance options. While cable or DSL internet offers cost savings, their inconsistent performance can be problematic. Conversely, dedicated private lines or MPLS networks deliver reliability and performance at a premium cost. If only there were a solution to make the internet perform like an MPLS network at a fraction of the cost. Thanks to SDN, there is.&lt;/p>

alt="SDN networks can manage Internet connections to replace MPLS networks."
>&lt;strong>What SDN is All About&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SDN, which stands for Software Defined Network, represents the forefront of telecommunications connectivity. You might also come across terms like Hybrid SDN or SDN-WAN, which highlight its ability to combine different network types. Let&amp;rsquo;s explore what these acronyms signify and how they can benefit you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SDN distinguishes itself from conventional hardware-based networks, like those used for telephone systems and the internet backbone, by using software to control network behavior. Traditional IP networks rely on routers and switches to determine data paths, while MPLS networks utilize specialized label switches to create a fixed network structure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In contrast, SDN shifts network intelligence from inflexible hardware to software. This software program dynamically manages the hardware components, determining how they route traffic in real-time. SDN-WAN specifically refers to a Wide Area Network managed by SDN principles. It can integrate internet connections, private lines, and MPLS networks into a single, virtual WAN.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>What’s Holding Back The Internet?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The internet&amp;rsquo;s allure as a low-cost connectivity solution has been hard to resist, but it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to remember that it was never designed to replace dedicated circuit-switched networks. The internet&amp;rsquo;s strength lies in its ability to reliably deliver data packets, regardless of network hiccups. TCP/IP ensures data integrity but doesn&amp;rsquo;t guarantee delivery speed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a result, internet users often experience performance fluctuations that, while merely inconvenient for casual browsing, can severely impact businesses running cloud-based applications. Voice and video communication, in particular, suffer from network neutrality, which treats all data equally. This lack of prioritization means VoIP packets compete with large file transfers, leading to choppy conversations and dropped calls.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Making The Internet Great For Business&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A closer examination reveals that most internet performance bottlenecks occur in &amp;ldquo;the last mile&amp;rdquo; connections, not the core network. Compromises made to keep connection costs down are often the culprit. For example, DSL and Cable, the most affordable broadband options, utilize shared bandwidth with varying upload and download speeds. This means users have little control over bandwidth availability, latency, packet loss, or overall reliability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dedicated Internet Access (DIA) offers a step up in reliability. Options like T1 lines, DS3 bandwidth, OCx SONET, Ethernet over Copper, and Fiber Optic Carrier Ethernet provide a more robust connection. However, this stability comes at a cost, often ranging from two to ten times that of basic broadband.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Where Do Private Lines and MPLS Fit In?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Building a private internet network using dedicated private lines offers the pinnacle of performance, with high bandwidth, low latency, minimal jitter and packet loss, and maximum availability. However, this approach becomes prohibitively expensive as distance and the number of locations increase. MPLS networks provide a cost-effective alternative by creating a private network between designated locations, offering better performance than the public internet at a lower cost than dedicated private lines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Businesses often choose MPLS for communication between headquarters, branch offices, and data centers where performance is critical.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>How SDN Mimics MPLS at Lower Cost&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The performance of Cable Broadband solutions has drastically improved in recent years, with speeds of 100 Mbps or even 1 Gbps now available at affordable prices. However, the inherent variability of Cable, DSL, 4G Wireless, and the internet itself remains a concern.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SDN controllers address this issue by actively managing available connectivity resources. By utilizing multiple connection types, such as Cable broadband, DSL, 4G, Dedicated Internet access, private lines, and even satellite, SDN can dynamically route traffic based on real-time network conditions. It can even distribute traffic across multiple paths if a single optimal route isn&amp;rsquo;t available.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This approach allows SDN to prioritize critical applications like VoIP and video conferencing by routing them through higher-performance connections. Essentially, SDN creates classes of service within your network, a feature absent in the public internet. This results in lower costs compared to an all-private network solution. Additionally, you gain the flexibility to connect to any location globally, including customers and suppliers, through the internet&amp;rsquo;s existing infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you suspect you&amp;rsquo;re overpaying for your wide area network, now is the perfect time to explore readily available, cost-effective &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.cloudbrokerageservice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

This reliance is only expected to increase as technology advances and electronic record-keeping becomes more common. This naturally raises concerns about the rising costs associated with these growing telecom needs. However, there are ways to manage and even reduce these expenses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most fundamental requirement for any organization is voice communication. For larger facilities, this typically involves a PBX phone system. Modern PBX systems are more compact and efficient than their predecessors. Consolidating multiple analog lines into a digital ISDN PRI trunk line can result in significant cost savings. For facilities requiring more than 23 outside lines, additional T1 lines can be easily incorporated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that ISDN PRI trunk line costs have decreased considerably in recent times. Competitive service providers often offer the same level of T1 service at a lower price, allowing for cost savings or expansion of telephone capabilities within the same budget.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>IP PBX systems are becoming increasingly popular for new installations and upgrades. These systems function similarly to traditional PBXs but with the added benefit of supporting VoIP handsets. This allows for the use of SIP trunking, potentially leading to substantial cost reductions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Data communication is another critical aspect of modern healthcare facilities. High-definition imaging equipment, electronic medical records, and regular administrative tasks demand a robust data infrastructure. While a T1 line might suffice for smaller offices, larger organizations often require higher bandwidth solutions like DS3 or fiber optic connections.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Similar to voice lines, data communication costs have also decreased in recent years. Switching to lower-cost providers offering equivalent services can lead to significant savings. However, the emergence of Carrier Ethernet networks presents even greater opportunities for cost reduction. Carrier Ethernet offers a compelling alternative to traditional fiber optic services, often with cost savings of 50% or more. With bandwidth options ranging from 5 Mbps to 10 Gbps, Carrier Ethernet provides scalable and cost-effective solutions for high-bandwidth needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you manage telecommunication expenses for a healthcare facility and are looking to reduce your monthly bills, evaluating your bandwidth needs is a good place to start. You might be surprised by the potential savings available.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Poken Enhances Face to Face Social Networking</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/poken-enhances-face-to-face-social-networking/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jun 2024 20:45:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/poken-enhances-face-to-face-social-networking/</guid><description>&lt;p>Is jotting down contact information on scraps of paper your go-to method?

While things have improved in Forecaster 7.0, it&amp;rsquo;s still best to avoid special characters in name and ID fields. Recently, a period caused confusion in Forecaster again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s what happened:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>A line set was named with a period at the end (e.g., &amp;ldquo;HR.&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This line set was used as an override on an input set.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Budget data was entered for the department.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Reviewing the data in the input set (Data&amp;raquo;Input) showed no issues. However, opening the line set (Build&amp;raquo;Lines) displayed it as empty. This didn&amp;rsquo;t seem problematic until the line set needed modification. In this instance, a new account had to be added. After adding the account and saving, the input set became blank except for the new account. The line set in the database was also blank, except for the added account.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The root cause was traced back to the period at the end of the line set name. Periods within the name didn&amp;rsquo;t cause this issue. Fortunately, renaming the line set without the period before making changes could recover the data. However, if changes were saved to the blank line set, it had to be recreated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This issue was discussed with Darian Hanson from support, and hopefully, it will be addressed. This experience serves as a reminder to remain cautious of special characters, even periods.&lt;/p>

However, managing these locations as a unified company requires connecting them effectively. Point-to-point lines and MPLS networks offer solutions for this need.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Consider a car dealership expanding by acquiring another dealership. While this offers strategic advantages, consolidating operations like accounting, marketing, and IT can lead to cost savings. Centralizing these functions requires reliable and efficient connectivity between locations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With most business operations relying on data, standardized computer systems become essential. Connecting these systems at different locations is where point-to-point T1 lines come in. These dedicated lines provide a secure and private connection between two locations, regardless of distance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Point-to-point T1 lines are versatile, used by radio stations for program transmission and businesses for secure data exchange. While connecting each location directly can become costly as a business grows, a hub-and-spoke arrangement with headquarters as the central hub offers a more efficient approach.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For connecting multiple locations, MPLS (Multi Protocol Label Switching) provides a private and shared network with guaranteed bandwidth. Each location utilizes a T1 line to access the network, and the MPLS provider manages connectivity between specific locations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ultimately, choosing between point-to-point T1 and MPLS depends on a business&amp;rsquo;s connectivity, bandwidth, privacy, and budget needs. Comparing service options and costs will help determine the most suitable solution.&lt;/p>

Ethernet over Copper (EoC) connections are increasing in availability and often come at a lower cost compared to other options.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>EoC enables standard Ethernet services to be delivered through existing copper telephone wiring. Unlike typical Cat 5E or Cat 6 wiring, EoC is compatible with older copper infrastructure not initially intended for Ethernet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the main advantages of EoC is its utilization of existing copper infrastructure, particularly in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) and Wide Area Networks (WANs). This eliminates the need for expensive construction, as the copper wiring is already in place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The technology works by leveraging unused twisted copper pairs, known as dry copper pairs. These pairs can be connected to EoC equipment, creating a high-speed Ethernet link from a location to the nearest telephone company office, where it can then be connected to other locations, typically via fiber optic lines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ethernet services, including EoC, come in standardized options. E-Line offers a direct point-to-point connection between two Local Area Networks (LANs), while E-LAN provides a multipoint service, similar to a meshed network, connecting three or more locations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While EoC bandwidth can range from 1 Mbps to 20 Mbps or higher, it&amp;rsquo;s important to note that distance limitations exist. Lower speeds typically offer a wider range, while higher speeds restrict the distance to under a mile. This distance constraint is why EoC is often considered a metropolitan service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Compared to services like T-Carrier or SONET, Ethernet offers greater scalability. Users can initially install a higher bandwidth capacity and only pay for the service they need, with the option to easily upgrade bandwidth as requirements change.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The cost-effectiveness of EoC, often providing double the bandwidth for a similar price compared to traditional T1 lines, makes it an attractive alternative. Furthermore, higher speeds are usually available at reasonable rates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Considering these advantages, evaluating the potential benefits of increased bandwidth or improved pricing through EoC is worthwhile.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Is 5G Bandwidth Slicing The New Private Network?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-5g-bandwidth-slicing-the-new-private-network/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jun 2024 00:10:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-5g-bandwidth-slicing-the-new-private-network/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>By: John Shepler&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The internet is great for connecting, but it&amp;rsquo;s not always reliable. While it provides widespread access, low costs, and supports most applications, it can fall short when high performance and reliability are crucial. Issues like latency, packet loss, and congestion can hinder or even prevent interactive applications from working correctly. The solution? Private networks.&lt;/p>

alt="5G bandwidth slicing for private networks."
>&lt;/a>&lt;strong>What is a Private Network?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The internet is a public network, accessible to almost anyone. All you need is an account with an internet service provider. Its strength lies in its global reach, built over decades. Everyone has equal footing – average users, corporations, and even connected devices. This principle is called network neutrality. The only things you can pay extra for are a faster connection to the internet backbone and more bandwidth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While this equality is generally beneficial, it can lead to performance issues. When numerous users demand high bandwidth simultaneously, like during a live-streamed event or peak backup times, connections can suffer. This is especially problematic for applications requiring high speeds and low latency, such as video conferencing, gaming, remote surgery, financial trading, or controlling electric vehicles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Private networks offer an alternative. Unlike your company&amp;rsquo;s LAN, which is isolated and typically offers sufficient bandwidth, private networks extend this concept across cities or even countries. Instead of building it yourself, you can partner with a network provider who offers dedicated point-to-point connections. While sharing infrastructure, you receive guaranteed bandwidth and network characteristics like low latency and minimal packet loss.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Types of Private Networks&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While older technologies like T1 lines and SONET fiber were once prevalent, today, Ethernet over Fiber and MPLS networks are the most popular choices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ethernet over Fiber mirrors your LAN&amp;rsquo;s protocol, simplifying integration. It supports various configurations like point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, and mesh networks, offering speeds from 10 Mbps to 10 Gbps, with 100 Gbps becoming more common. Popular uses include connecting to cloud providers, linking business locations, and content delivery.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MPLS networks are specialized for wide-area connectivity, even internationally. Their unique protocol enhances security compared to standard IP networks. Though shared, these networks guarantee each customer their contracted bandwidth. MPLS networks with Ethernet access points offer extensive coverage at a lower cost than multiple private lines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>5G Slicing as the New Private Network&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The rise of mobile applications requires wireless connectivity. While 4G LTE and now 5G offer significant improvements, they still rely on the internet with its inherent limitations. Bandwidth constraints and congestion can impact application performance, especially in busy areas. 5G slicing addresses this by reserving a portion of bandwidth for private use, for an additional fee.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Think of it as having a dedicated lane on a congested highway. 5G slicing offers a faster path to the internet or can create a private network or connection to a private fiber network. It&amp;rsquo;s essentially your LAN without wires, accessible over a wide area.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some organizations are implementing private 5G networks on their premises for similar benefits. 5G slicing expands this concept, providing connectivity on the go, including for vehicles, smartphones, tablets, and various devices that struggle with traditional internet connections.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Issues with 5G Slicing&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As 5G slicing is still in its early stages, availability might be limited. One concern is the potential for congestion if everyone seeks a private slice of the bandwidth. While 5G offers more bandwidth, especially on higher frequencies, it&amp;rsquo;s not unlimited. This scarcity drives the push for more 5G frequencies, including some currently allocated to the military.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Network neutrality also poses a challenge. Allowing paid prioritization through 5G slicing contradicts the principle of a neutral internet. While regulators currently accept it with some conditions, the increasing privatization of wireless spectrum might face opposition.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Are you frustrated with your company&amp;rsquo;s slow internet speeds? It&amp;rsquo;s understandable. Today&amp;rsquo;s applications are much more demanding than the simple websites and text-based emails common when T1 lines were first introduced. A 10 Mbps connection is now the bare minimum for most businesses, and it&amp;rsquo;s reasonable to need 100 Mbps or even 1000 Mbps. So, how can you upgrade effectively?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.gigapackets.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;img src="http://www.gigapackets.com/images/BandwidthGrowth10M1G250.jpg"
loading="lazy"
alt="Business bandwidth for 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps and 1000 Mbps at attractive prices."
>&lt;/a>&lt;strong>Upgrading Your Connection&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One option is to gradually increase your bandwidth as your needs grow. Bonded T1 lines offer speeds from 3 to 12 Mbps in 1.5 Mbps increments. However, you must use a single provider for all lines, and equipment changes are needed with each upgrade. Still, this might be the best choice in rural areas with limited options.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another option is Ethernet over Copper (EoC), which is available in most metropolitan areas. EoC provides higher bandwidth (3 to 20 Mbps) at lower costs compared to bonded T1. However, bandwidth decreases with distance from the service provider&amp;rsquo;s office.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most promising option today is Ethernet over Fiber. While fiber optic service was once rare and expensive, newer Ethernet over Fiber solutions offer businesses several advantages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Advantages of Ethernet over Fiber&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ethernet over Fiber (EoF) utilizes the same Ethernet protocol as your company&amp;rsquo;s LAN but with enhancements for telecom carrier use. Also called Carrier Ethernet or Metro Ethernet, this metropolitan service is easy to integrate with your network. A fiber or copper Ethernet connection links to your service provider, which you plug into your edge router.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Designed for scalability, EoF makes upgrades simple, usually without equipment changes. Unlike legacy services that required lengthy carrier-led equipment swaps, EoF upgrades happen quickly, often within hours or days. Some providers even allow on-demand adjustments through a computer interface.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Bandwidth Options&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ethernet over Fiber typically starts at 10 Mbps and can reach 10 Gbps or higher. Common speeds align with standard Ethernet LAN speeds: 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, and 1000 Mbps. You can also get speeds between these benchmarks, starting at 10 Mbps and gradually increasing to 100 Mbps or more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The crucial factor is the installed port speed, which dictates the connection speed to the provider&amp;rsquo;s equipment. A 100 Mbps Fast Ethernet connection is suitable for speeds up to 100 Mbps, while a Gigabit Ethernet port is recommended for higher speeds. For anything beyond 1 Gbps, install a 10 Gbps port from the outset to avoid future equipment changes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Cost-Effectiveness&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The popularity of Ethernet over Fiber has led many traditional and new carriers to offer it, creating a competitive market that benefits buyers. EoF pricing per Mbps is significantly lower than bonded T1, DS3 (T3), or SONET services. You can potentially cut your internet costs by 50% or more while maintaining high reliability, low latency, minimal jitter, and minimal packet loss.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The recent tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, has left many young students grappling with trauma and fear. The horrific event, where students and educators lost their lives, has created a sense of anxiety about returning to school for the spring semester. Finding a way to comfort these children and help them cope with their fears is a significant challenge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kim Piscatelli from East Hampton, Connecticut, believes she&amp;rsquo;s found a way to provide some comfort. Inspired by the children&amp;rsquo;s book &amp;ldquo;The Kissing Hand&amp;rdquo; by Audrey Penn, Kim initiated a project to provide each child in Newtown with a copy of the book and a pair of mittens or gloves adorned with a heart on the left palm. The book tells the story of Chester Raccoon, whose mother kisses his palm to reassure him whenever he feels lonely or misses home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The project has garnered immense support, with knitting groups actively creating mittens with heart accents. The aim is to ensure that every child receives a pair of these comforting mittens along with the book as they return to school.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While the response has been positive, the need is extensive. Hundreds of students from Sandy Hook Elementary and surrounding areas have been impacted by the tragedy. To address this, individuals are encouraged to contribute by sending child-size mittens or gloves with heart embellishments to:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Kissing Hand Mitten Project
93 East High Street
East Hampton, Ct. 06424&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Gloves are readily available, and heart shapes can be easily found in fabric stores. The goal is to gather and send as many mittens and gloves as possible to provide comfort and support to the children.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Chester the Raccoon&amp;rdquo; plush dolls are also available for purchase online. These cuddly companions can offer additional comfort to the children.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, the book &amp;ldquo;The Kissing Hand&amp;rdquo; is temporarily available as a free download on iTunes, offering a digital version with text, illustrations, and narration. Physical copies are also readily available for purchase.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The hope is that this small gesture of a &amp;ldquo;kissing hand&amp;rdquo; will provide a sense of comfort and security, allowing the children to gradually return to a sense of normalcy in their lives. The project embodies a collective effort to support and uplift the community in the wake of unimaginable tragedy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>No-Till Gardening Using Minibeds-on-Plastic: The Importance of Glomalin and Mycorrhizae</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/no-till-gardening-using-minibeds-on-plastic-the-importance-of-glomalin-and-mycorrhizae/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jun 2024 19:59:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/no-till-gardening-using-minibeds-on-plastic-the-importance-of-glomalin-and-mycorrhizae/</guid><description>&lt;p>Dateline: 11 March 2017&lt;/p>

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Amazing beauty, on a microscopic level&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My new Minibeds-on-Plastic experimental garden is designed as a no-till system for growing vegetables. While there will be no soil disturbance under the plastic covering most of the garden, the &amp;ldquo;island&amp;rdquo; minibeds themselves will also remain mostly undisturbed. This minimal-till approach is central to the Minibeds-on-Plastic method, and I&amp;rsquo;ll explain why.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Contrary to common belief, tilling the soil does not enhance its structure. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t improve aeration or create the porous texture crucial for a thriving garden.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I used to rototill my entire garden every spring, believing it was the correct way to prepare for planting. However, I&amp;rsquo;ve since realized that extensive tilling is detrimental to both the soil and the plants. Since I stopped this practice, my gardens have become more productive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My shift to no-till gardening stems from learning about the vital role of soil structure and, more specifically, mycorrhizal fungi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Mycorrhizal Factor&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The image at the beginning of this post displays a mycorrhizal &lt;em>arbuscle&lt;/em> within a plant root cell. This isn&amp;rsquo;t a harmful invasion but a mutually beneficial relationship crucial for gardeners to grasp. Mycorrhizal fungi offer numerous advantages to plants.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Essentially, plants provide nourishment to these fungi. Through photosynthesis, plant leaves use sunlight and carbon dioxide to produce sugars (carbohydrates). While some of these sugars fuel plant growth, a significant portion is released into the soil.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plants &amp;ldquo;leak&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;pump&amp;rdquo; a surprising amount of these sugars to support soil microbes, with mycorrhizal fungi being major beneficiaries. In the image, the arbuscle, resembling a tree, absorbs these sugars for its growth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the mycorrhizal fungi grow, they extend a vast network of thread-like hyphae far beyond the plant&amp;rsquo;s root system. These hyphae act as extensions of the roots, accessing water and nutrients that the roots cannot reach.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The famous illustrations of root systems by Professor John Weaver do not depict the vast network of mycorrhizal hyphae that likely coexist and collaborate with these roots. Imagine those root systems intertwined with an equally extensive, if not larger, network of hyphae.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj0EOyB_c0Y-jFGWv2tC5DGYCAqzuiksmR4r5Gdjm3Xg9SRLaZuit4YtmpFt747sjZkSU21TLsfC7HaQHpVbH4jM4GWHJZoZuO9jCZqyibYsSuTHv-NrcjUMc8sVaTjHVymuY-p-LwjX6Q/s1600/Sweet-Corn_Mature-Roots&amp;#43;jpg.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

loading="lazy"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plants colonized by mycorrhizal fungi exhibit increased nutrient and water uptake, resulting in visible improvements above ground.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These fungi also enhance plant resilience against diseases and, remarkably, participate in a complex underground communication network between plants and the soil ecosystem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beyond benefiting plant growth and health, mycorrhizal fungi significantly improve the soil structure surrounding them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Glomalin Factor&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mycorrhizal hyphae release a substance called glomalin as they spread through the soil. This newly discovered (1996) &amp;ldquo;biological glue&amp;rdquo; binds soil particles together, improving soil aggregation and tilth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Aggregation results in both large and small pores within the soil. Well-aggregated soil allows water to be absorbed and drained efficiently, promoting aeration and a thriving environment for beneficial soil microbes. This is clearly demonstrated in the video at the end of this post.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, common gardening practices, such as tilling, disrupt the mycorrhizal network and destroy glomalin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No-till gardening preserves glomalin, enhances soil structure, and allows plants to reap the full benefits of naturally occurring mycorrhizal fungi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>No-Till With Minibeds-on-Plastic&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mycorrhizal fungi and glomalin are most effective in the presence of living roots. In my Minibeds-on-Plastic system, a significant portion of the garden is covered with black plastic mulch. This creates a no-till environment under the plastic, but without plants or roots.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While this might seem like a drawback, I see it as a necessary trade-off. I&amp;rsquo;m accepting a reduction in the overall benefits of a fully no-till system in exchange for increased manageability and productivity within the focused area of the minibeds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Without the plastic mulch, weeds would quickly take over my garden. This has been a recurring challenge, making the garden less productive and requiring constant effort to control weeds. The Minibeds-on-Plastic system will prevent this and eliminate the need for disruptive tilling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because I won&amp;rsquo;t be digging the minibeds, the existing roots, mycorrhizal hyphae, and glomalin will remain undisturbed, allowing them to extend their benefits beyond the minibed boundaries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Furthermore, my no-till approach includes rotating root-dense cover crops, particularly rye, in the minibeds during the fall and spring. These cover crops will not be tilled in as green manure; instead, their above-ground growth will be harvested, chopped, and used as mulch or added to compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is my vision of no-till gardening within the Minibeds-on-Plastic system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dan Grubbs has raised concerns about potential heat buildup under the black plastic and its impact on beneficial soil organisms. This is a valid point, particularly in specific growing regions, as I addressed in Minibeds-on-Plastic Report #1 (see Question 15 on page 25). If this becomes an issue, I plan to add a layer of wood chips over the black plastic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Some Fungal Loose Ends&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that mycorrhizal fungi are just one type of fungi found in soil. Some break down organic matter, others are harmful, but most are beneficial.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While mycorrhizal fungi form symbiotic relationships with most plants, they do not cooperate with brassicas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These fungi are naturally present in most garden soils and will thrive under the right conditions, such as no-till practices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Commercially available mycorrhizal inoculants exist, but their efficacy is debatable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, some bacteria contribute to soil aggregation on a smaller scale by producing bio-glues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Evidence Of Good Soil Structure&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This video featuring Ray Archuleta offers a compelling look at the advantages of no-till gardening and farming. It is a must-watch!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Merchant Account Credit Card Processing Made Easy</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/merchant-account-credit-card-processing-made-easy/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jun 2024 17:42:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/merchant-account-credit-card-processing-made-easy/</guid><description>&lt;p>Even the smallest businesses need a way to process credit card payments.

To clarify, Dynamics GP software generates zero-dollar checks when an invoice is fully paid through methods like credit memos or manual payments. This often happens before a check run or when opting for automatic application of unapplied documents during check runs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These zero-dollar checks, appearing on the edit list after a check batch is created, act as placeholders, allowing for a remittance advice to be printed within the check run, confirming the invoice was settled using existing credits.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s illustrate with an example:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>An invoice for $100 is entered and posted for Vendor ABC.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A manual payment of $100 is entered, posted, and applied to the invoice for Vendor ABC.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A check batch is created.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Regular checks, along with a zero-dollar check for Vendor ABC, are selected for payment.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The appearance of a zero-dollar check often causes confusion. Remember, it serves solely as a placeholder. However, the process differs between standard Dynamics GP and when using Mekorma MICR.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In standard Dynamics GP:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>You print checks.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Only regular checks are printed; the zero-dollar check is ignored.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You proceed to post the checks.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The remittance advice for the zero-dollar check can then be printed separately.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>With Mekorma MICR:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The zero-dollar check prints along with regular checks. It&amp;rsquo;s assigned a &amp;ldquo;REMIT&amp;rdquo; check number, preventing it from being posted to bank reconciliation.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This difference in printing behavior between standard Dynamics GP and Mekorma MICR often causes confusion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>More details about zero-dollar checks and Dynamics GP are available in my upcoming blog post on the BKD GP Team Blog.&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s widely available and offered a significant upgrade from older T1 lines. However, with the rise of video conferencing and cloud-based applications, even DS3 struggles to handle the demands of multiple users. It&amp;rsquo;s time to consider upgrading to 100 Mbps internet access.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.fibernetworkquotes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;img src="http://FiberNetworkQuotes.com/images/100MbpsBandwidth250.gif"
loading="lazy"
alt="Check prices for 100 Mbps bandwidth options&amp;hellip;"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The 100 Mbps service level is significant because it aligns with &amp;ldquo;Fast&amp;rdquo; Ethernet, a standard Ethernet LAN speed. Most network interface cards (NICs) in computers, routers, switches, and printers support 10/100 Mbps Ethernet speeds. Newer NICs even support Gigabit Ethernet (GigE) with 10/100/1000 Mbps ports.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The issue is that connecting to the internet at a slower speed than your 100 Mbps LAN will cause a bottleneck for internet traffic. While this might not be noticeable during low network activity, congestion becomes apparent with multiple users and heavy data usage. The connection to the internet, often the WAN or wide area network, becomes the chokepoint.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fortunately, 100 Mbps business internet service is now more accessible and affordable than ever. Let&amp;rsquo;s explore the various technical approaches and their pros and cons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>OC-3, a traditional 100 Mbps telecom service, operates at around 155 Mbps. Offered by telecom companies nationwide, OC-3 is a fiber optic SONET service. It can transport various data types, including phone calls, private connections, and dedicated internet access. OC-3 is also used to deliver lower-speed services like DS3. While you might not associate DS3 with fiber optics due to its coaxial cable connections, it&amp;rsquo;s often delivered through add/drop multiplexers connected to SONET fiber cables.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>OC-3 is a well-established and popular digital line service with an SLA (Service Level Agreement), ensuring reliability. Your bandwidth is both dedicated and symmetrical. Dedicated bandwidth means you don&amp;rsquo;t share the 155 Mbps with other users, ensuring consistent availability. Symmetrical bandwidth means you have 155 Mbps for both uploads and downloads.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Carrier Ethernet directly competes with OC-3 in bandwidth. Connecting to your LAN with Fast Ethernet at 100 Mbps is straightforward using a standard RJ-45 patch cable, eliminating the need for specialized fiber optic cables or interface cards required for OC-3. Like OC-3, 100 Mbps Fast Ethernet is symmetrical, dedicated, and comes with an SLA.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fast Ethernet is available over both fiber optic and twisted-pair connections. However, Ethernet over Copper at this speed has distance limitations, making it more common in metropolitan areas. Slower speeds like 10 or 20 Mbps have a wider range and are more accessible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ethernet over Fiber, similar to OC-3, offers two key advantages. Firstly, the cost per Mbps is often lower than OC-3. Secondly, Carrier Ethernet services are scalable. While upgrading from OC-3 typically means moving to OC-12 at 622 Mbps, Carrier Ethernet offers more flexibility. With a Gigabit Ethernet port, you can easily upgrade to 200, 500, or even 1,000 Mbps as your needs grow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another increasingly available option is 100 Mbps Cable business broadband. This shared, asymmetrical service, similar to residential cable internet, typically lacks service level agreements. While it offers download speeds up to 100 Mbps, upload speeds are around 10 Mbps. This bandwidth is shared with other users, resulting in varying speeds, especially during peak hours. However, its affordability, often comparable to a T1 line, makes it suitable for businesses with limited budgets and basic internet needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re considering new business internet service or upgrading from bonded T1 or DS3 to 100 Mbps or higher, now is the time to explore your options. Check &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.fibernetworkquotes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

If your company requires communication between multiple locations within a city, a metro network might be beneficial.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Metro Ethernet is the modern solution for data connections in major cities and surrounding areas. There are two main types: E-Line and E-LAN. E-Line provides a direct Ethernet connection between two points, such as a business and its data center, warehouse, factory, or branch office.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>E-LAN, on the other hand, facilitates multi-point connections, resembling a LAN spread across a city, often called a Wide Area Network (WAN). This allows for connecting a main office to multiple branches, retail locations, warehouses, factories, or other sites within the metropolitan area. Both E-Line and E-LAN effectively unite local networks into a larger company network.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A high-quality MAN is characterized by speed, reliability, and affordability. While bandwidth is variable, Ethernet MANs typically offer standard Ethernet LAN speeds of 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, and 1000 Mbps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fiber optic lines are commonly employed in MANs for their speed, capacity, and reliability. Gigabit Ethernet speeds require a fiber optic connection to your building. Business locations in major metropolitan areas, where metro networks are prevalent, often have existing fiber optic infrastructure or are near a carrier point of presence (POP). This is particularly common in large office buildings with multiple tenants and colocation facilities hosting server farms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Carriers often extend fiber optic connections to buildings with sufficient bandwidth demand. In areas where this is impractical or financially unfeasible, Ethernet MAN connections can utilize Ethernet over Copper (EoC) technology. This system uses existing telephone wiring to provide Ethernet speeds between 1 and 100 Mbps, depending on the distance from the carrier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A key advantage is the competitive landscape driving down the cost of MAN connections significantly lower than traditional telephone company offerings. Ethernet MAN services might be surprisingly affordable. To explore available options and pricing for your business, you can use services like GeoQuote Ethernet Service Locator.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hosted Exchange Email Service Advantages</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/hosted-exchange-email-service-advantages/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jun 2024 15:58:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/hosted-exchange-email-service-advantages/</guid><description>&lt;p>POP3 email, while widely used by both businesses and individuals, has limitations that might make you reconsider your email service. While convenient, its client-server model, where emails are downloaded to your device, poses risks such as data loss and limited accessibility.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What exactly is POP3? It stands for Post Office Protocol, an internet standard for retrieving emails from a server to a client, like Microsoft Outlook or Mac Mail, installed on your computer. This setup allows offline access to downloaded emails but limits access from other devices and risks losing all your emails if your device fails.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While POP3 has its advantages, such as offline email access, it has some downsides. If your computer crashes, you risk losing all your emails. Additionally, managing emails across multiple devices becomes difficult, and you&amp;rsquo;re more vulnerable to spam and viruses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While large companies use Microsoft Exchange on their own servers for enhanced security and features, smaller companies find it challenging to manage. Hosted Exchange offers a solution by providing the benefits of Microsoft Exchange without needing to manage your own server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hosted Exchange, managed by a hosting provider, offers several advantages. These include automatic backups, access from any device, easier email recovery, and secure communication with SSL encryption.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re considering a more modern and robust email system, Hosted Exchange might be the right choice. It scales to your needs, eliminates the hassle of managing your own server, and can be more cost-effective.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Version 2 of the Project Accounting Timesheet Recalc has been released.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/version-2-of-the-project-accounting-timesheet-recalc-has-been-released/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jun 2024 10:42:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/version-2-of-the-project-accounting-timesheet-recalc-has-been-released/</guid><description>&lt;p>A new version of the Project Accounting Timesheet Recalc Utility (Version 2.0) has been released to address a customer&amp;rsquo;s need.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This utility is designed for Dynamics GP users who utilize Project Accounting Timesheets to track salaried employees&amp;rsquo; time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Salaried employees receive fixed payroll costs. However, when their worked hours fluctuate from the standard hours within a pay period, the general ledger project timesheet costs don&amp;rsquo;t align with their actual payroll expenses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Companies approach this discrepancy in various ways: some disregard it, others make manual adjustments to align timesheet costs with payroll amounts, and some post summary adjustments to rectify the difference. However, none of these methods are ideal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The PA Timesheet Recalc utility addresses this by modifying unit costs on PA timesheets to ensure they correspond with the employee&amp;rsquo;s payroll. It accomplishes this by averaging the unit cost based on timesheet hours, managing rounding discrepancies from the average cost calculation, and recalculating timesheet distributions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The original version of this utility was developed for companies where employees submitted a single timesheet per pay period. In this scenario, the total timesheet cost would consistently match the employee&amp;rsquo;s pay and any associated overhead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, in some organizations, employees submit multiple timesheets within a pay period. This is common when different managers, responsible for different projects, need to approve timesheets, leading to employees submitting separate timesheets daily for each project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To accommodate this, Version 2.0 of the PA Timesheet Recalc utility can now recalculate multiple timesheets for an employee over any given date range. For example, if an employee submits 20 timesheets between January 16th and January 30th, the utility analyzes all timesheets to determine the correct average cost and recalculates them. The user can define the date range and choose multiple employees to include in this process.&lt;/p>

People ask about managing revenue recognition, only to discover that many handle it by simply recognizing revenue alongside expenses and fees. This leads to the assumption that revenue recognition isn&amp;rsquo;t necessary, overlooking the need for accruals at the end of each month for unbilled amounts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sometimes, the conversation shifts to using the revenue recognition module for accruals. This method proves to be complex and inefficient, especially since GP&amp;rsquo;s revenue recognition typically functions in one of three ways: based on project progress (measured by cost or hours), upon project completion, or over time for service fees.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What many miss is that GP Project Accounting has built-in functionality for accruing unbilled revenue and its corresponding unbilled accounts receivable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This involves using a Time and Materials Project with the &amp;ldquo;When Performed&amp;rdquo; accounting method. This method generates a credit to Unbilled Project Revenue and a debit to Unbilled Accounts Receivable when a project cost is posted. The amounts in these accounts are determined by the budgeted profit type and the project amount/percentage. Upon billing the expenses, the amounts shift from unbilled to actual revenue and accounts receivable. This way, the unbilled accounts receivable and unbilled revenue represent your accrual at any given time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While this works well for expenses, accounting for fees and their accrual requires a different approach. Instead of using a fee, a zero-cost miscellaneous log is used. This involves setting up a miscellaneous log cost category with no cost, a quantity matching the total fee (if known), a billing rate profit type, and a billing rate of $1. This allows you to enter a zero-cost miscellaneous log at month-end, with the quantity reflecting the fee amount you want to accrue. The system then calculates the accrued revenue and accrued accounts receivable for the general ledger posting. This method is especially useful when the fee accrual isn&amp;rsquo;t predetermined but is determined by external factors like project milestones.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The advantage of managing fees as zero-cost miscellaneous logs is that they enter the Work in Progress (WIP) queue for billing at the desired amount.&lt;/p>

The most fundamental of these is IaaS, which forms the basis for the other two. IaaS essentially refers to providing basic hardware and operating system software over the internet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.cloudnetworkingservices.com/cloud-computing-providers.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;img src="http://www.cloudnetworkingservices.com/images/CloudIaaS.jpg"
loading="lazy"
alt="Cloud computing providers offer infrastructure on demand. "
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Infrastructure is fairly self-explanatory: it&amp;rsquo;s the foundational hardware and software needed for computing. When considering cloud infrastructure, the comparison is often made with having your own data center. So why would a business choose to move to the cloud?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are compelling business reasons to use IaaS. Traditional infrastructure is expensive to purchase and maintain, demanding constant upkeep and becoming obsolete quickly. Physical infrastructure is also sensitive, requiring controlled environments, security measures, and significant power resources.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another consideration is determining how much infrastructure to acquire. You need enough to handle regular operations, but what about unforeseen spikes in demand? Products can suddenly become popular, or online content can go viral, leading to unexpected surges in traffic. Social media platforms are well-acquainted with this phenomenon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cloud service providers present a solution to the limitations of on-premise data centers, frequently with significant cost advantages. Their business model is based on scale. They build large data centers filled with virtualized and dedicated servers, storage systems, security tools, and diverse network connections. All of this is housed in highly secure facilities with redundant power systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This might sound like a colocation center, and there are similarities. However, a key difference is elasticity. Elasticity refers to the ability of resources to scale up or down as needed. With colocation services, you typically have a fixed contract, and while you can adjust it, changes take time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cloud services operate on a utility computing model, similar to electricity. You don&amp;rsquo;t request more power from the utility company; you simply use what you need. Only when you exceed your capacity do you need to adjust your service level.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>IaaS is priced based on usage. Cloud providers possess vast resources, and their economies of scale allow them to serve numerous clients, each unaware of the others. Your services are isolated, ensuring that no other user can impact your resources or operations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The benefit for businesses is clear: IaaS provides the necessary resources, when needed, at a cost that reflects actual consumption rather than idle capacity. This eliminates the need for large capital investments and reduces staffing requirements, as the provider manages operations and maintenance constantly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To determine if your business could benefit from cloud services, it&amp;rsquo;s worthwhile to &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.cloudnetworkingservices.com/cloud-computing-providers.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>compare pricing and services from different cloud providers&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A simple Dynamics GP customer query unexpectedly returned zero results, even though the customer existed in the system. Upon closer inspection, it was discovered that the customer ID had a leading space.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While Dynamics GP prevents users from entering leading spaces directly, eConnect allows them during import. This discrepancy can cause issues when querying data, as SQL differentiates between values with and without leading spaces.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This highlights the importance of trimming leading and trailing white space from data during integration. Even though Dynamics GP doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow leading spaces, eConnect&amp;rsquo;s acceptance of them can lead to data inconsistencies and unexpected behavior.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The author emphasizes that trimming white space is crucial for data integrity and consistency, regardless of the system&amp;rsquo;s built-in restrictions. This seemingly minor detail can have a significant impact on data retrieval and integration processes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Key takeaways:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Leading spaces in data can cause problems in various systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Dynamics GP and eConnect handle leading spaces differently, potentially causing discrepancies.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Trimming leading and trailing white space is essential for all imported data to avoid unforeseen issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

However, they can also be used for Voice over IP (VoIP) communication between company locations or to connect with the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) through gateways.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Traditional T1 lines were designed to carry 24 simultaneous high-quality phone calls over a copper wire pair. Each call is digitized and placed into one of 24 eight-bit time slots, synchronized precisely using atomic clocks. Devices called channel banks handle the multiplexing and demultiplexing, essentially creating 24 distinct phone lines at each end. T1 PRI lines function similarly but dedicate one channel for signaling and data like Caller ID.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>T1 and T1 PRI lines remain viable choices for businesses with traditional PBX phone systems. The interface remains consistent, and costs have significantly decreased. Most PBX and larger Key systems offer compatible interface boards.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>VoIP differs from traditional circuit-switched telephony. Although voice is still converted from analog to digital, potentially using the same CODEC (Coder/Decoder), it&amp;rsquo;s handled differently. Instead of rigid time slots, digital voice samples are packaged into packets. These packets, adhering to the Internet Protocol (IP), coexist with data packets on the network. Transmission speed depends on network capacity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For VoIP, the full 1.5 Mbps capacity of a T1 line is utilized as a Wide Area Network (WAN), referred to as &amp;ldquo;unchannelized.&amp;rdquo; Imagine it as a large data pipeline connecting two points. Both ends could be company locations, or one could connect to the internet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A key difference between TDM-based T1 and VoIP is bandwidth management. In VoIP, your network, through routers or an IP PBX, prioritizes voice packets over less time-sensitive data to ensure call quality. Adequate bandwidth for peak voice traffic is crucial. As your needs grow, additional T1 lines can be combined to increase bandwidth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since both voice and data use the IP format, unchannelized T1 lines can carry both simultaneously. This enables &amp;ldquo;integrated T1 line service,&amp;rdquo; providing phone and internet over a single line. An IAD converts phone calls to VoIP, combines voice and data packets, then separates them at the destination, sending voice to the phone network and data to the internet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Businesses using VoIP can leverage T1 lines for voice and data between offices. IP PBXs or IP Phones convert calls to data packets, eliminating the need for a separate IAD. However, a voice gateway might be necessary for calls outside the organization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that WAN connections are now available using Ethernet. By choosing Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, or Gigabit Ethernet WAN, businesses can establish efficient network connections regardless of distance.&lt;/p>

It achieves this by encapsulating these protocols within its own tunnels upon entering the network and restoring them to their original format upon exit. Within the MPLS network, routing occurs based on simplified tags inserted into packet headers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Constructing this specialized network for transporting other network traffic offers the advantage of defining service classes. This ensures that real-time data, such as voice and video, receive the necessary bandwidth and low latency for optimal performance. The multi-protocol nature of this network is particularly appealing to carriers tasked with transporting diverse data types. Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS), a set of extensions, further enhances the versatility of this already adaptable network.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While MPLS focuses on controlling packet flow in packet-switched networks, GMPLS acknowledges the existence of other network types with elements not necessarily packet-oriented. For example, Time Division Multiplexing (TDM), the traditional digital telephony standard and foundation of Synchronous Optical Network (SONET), relies on time slots rather than packets. Although packets can be transmitted over TDM networks, large packets are divided into multiple time slots and reassembled later. This process negates the inherent advantages of predictable time slots in TDM, as they become irrelevant in the packet-switched world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>GMPLS reintroduces the significance of TDM. A time slot can function as a label, eliminating the need for additional labels since the network inherently understands the data carried within each time slot. Similarly, a wavelength or Lambda can serve as a label in a Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) network. Even an entire fiber can be treated as a GMPLS label to define a network path.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Assigning labels to all network elements involved in data packet routing decisions grants the GMPLS network a high degree of autonomy. It receives data from various protocols at the ingress point and adds its own labels. These labels can be MPLS &amp;ldquo;shim&amp;rdquo; type inserted into packet headers or &amp;ldquo;implicit&amp;rdquo; type associated with specific fibers, wavelengths, or TDM time slots. Label routing switches then route the GMPLS data over predetermined paths established at the ingress point. Upon reaching the network edge (egress point), all labeling information is removed, allowing the different data types to proceed in their native protocols.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Significantly, there is no mention of manual intervention for circuit provisioning or route setup. GMPLS networks inherently recognize available network resources and automatically establish and dismantle label-switched paths as required. The widespread deployment of GMPLS networks is anticipated to significantly simplify and expedite the labor-intensive task of service provisioning through automation.&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s your lifeline to customers. If they can&amp;rsquo;t easily recall your number, they might dial a competitor&amp;rsquo;s instead. This is where vanity numbers come into play.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What exactly are vanity numbers? They are standard phone numbers designed for easy memorization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are two main categories of vanity numbers. The first type spells a word or phrase, similar to personalized license plates. Creativity knows no bounds here!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But how can you spell with numbers? The answer lies in the dial pad. Every modern phone features a 12-button dial pad, also known as a touchpad or touch-tone pad. These buttons replaced the rotary dial. Those familiar with rotary phones know that each finger hole had letters and numbers. For instance, the number 2 corresponded to A, B, and C. Early phone numbers even used letters to represent exchanges, like AD for Adams, for simpler memorization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Similarly, modern dial pads retain letter-number assignments. Number 2 corresponds to A, B, and C, 3 to D, E, and F, and so on. Only the number 1 stands alone. The remaining buttons, * and #, serve special functions unrelated to phone numbers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, compare remembering 1-877-327-4325 to 1-877-3-BRIDAL. For a bridal shop, the latter is more memorable and relevant. Other examples include 1-866-89-BIBLE, 1-866-6-BEEPER, and 1-866-684-DEAL— all real, available numbers. While these specific numbers might be taken, countless others await. &lt;a class="link" href="https://fusion.kallback.com/kall8/index.cfm?agentID=apl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Discover affordable toll-free options here.&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second type of vanity number relies on numerical patterns for easy recall. Consider 1-866-262-1500, memorable for its double zero ending. Or 1-800-301-1010 with its repeating pattern. These are also real, currently available numbers. Naturally, such unique patterns are limited and pricier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Toll-free numbers, especially vanity numbers, are invaluable for small businesses. They incentivize customers to choose you over competitors. Local calls are cost-effective, but long distance charges can deter potential clients. Toll-free numbers eliminate this barrier, crucial for mail-order businesses, consultants, travel agents, and even bridal shops, directly impacting sales.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The good news is that vanity numbers remain affordable, except for those rare premium numbers. &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.agile800.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Agile800.com&lt;/a> offers vanity numbers ready for immediate use at a nominal fee of $15-$20. Examples include 1-877-7-ALUMNI, 1-866-84-BOATS, and 1-866-329-DEBT, among many others. Remember, availability changes rapidly, so act fast!&lt;/p>

While you could once manage a website with just a computer and a few phone lines, today&amp;rsquo;s high-definition video and nationwide audiences demand far more resources. This is where content delivery networks (CDNs) come in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Think of a CDN as a specialized web hosting service. Just as you can host your website on your own server or outsource it, you can also choose between managing your content distribution or relying on a CDN. CDNs handle the technical aspects, like server upkeep, power, and high-speed internet connections, so you can focus on creating content.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Opting for a CDN offers similar advantages to using a hosting service: it&amp;rsquo;s often simpler, more cost-effective, and more scalable. CDNs have their own networks designed for storing and delivering content to many users across a large area. They guarantee sufficient bandwidth for your needs, whether it&amp;rsquo;s software, music, or high-definition video. Some CDNs even have partnerships with internet service providers (ISPs) to bypass the public internet entirely, resulting in faster content delivery.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>CDNs use different methods to optimize their services. Some store multiple copies of your content on servers across the country, directing your download request to the closest available copy. Others distribute content across their network for efficient delivery. Load balancing among servers enhances reliability by automatically switching to a working server if one fails.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Speaking of bandwidth, if you&amp;rsquo;re finding your current capacity insufficient, it might be time to explore better WAN bandwidth options.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ethernet Connects Businesses Throughout Latin America</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-connects-businesses-throughout-latin-america/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2024 06:05:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-connects-businesses-throughout-latin-america/</guid><description>&lt;p>In recent years, numerous businesses have opted for Carrier Ethernet services for various connectivity needs, including Dedicated Internet Access (DIA), point-to-point private lines, last-mile access to MPLS networks, and meshed connections linking multiple business locations within the United States. This capability is now expanding globally. For instance, Level 3, a prominent international carrier, received recognition from the Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF) for its services in the Caribbean and Latin America.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While international voice and data services have been around for a long time, facilitated by extensive undersea fiber optic cables connecting continents, the recent shift lies in protocol changes and the emergence of new services for global companies and organizations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ethernet&amp;rsquo;s displacement of older protocols stems from the dominance of IP packets in electronic communication. Most Local Area Networks (LANs) are Ethernet-based, and the internet, the largest interconnected network, relies on routing IP packets. This begs the question: why not extend existing networks using the Ethernet protocol?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The primary obstacle to a faster transition to IP-based core networks is legacy infrastructure. The substantial investments in infrastructure over the past century, primarily built by telephone companies using Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) standards like T1, DS3, and SONET, won&amp;rsquo;t disappear overnight.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fortunately, existing telecom equipment doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to be replaced to implement Ethernet services. Carrier Ethernet functions over IP and TDM networks. Ethernet over T1 (EoDS1) serves as an effective last-mile connection for MPLS networks or point-to-point private lines, leveraging the extensive reach of T1 infrastructure, particularly in rural areas. Ethernet over DS3 (EoDS3) offers higher bandwidth at 45 Mbps, while Ethernet over SONET starts at 155 Mbps and scales to at least 10 Gbps, with some connections reaching 40 Gbps and 100 Gbps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The presence of the Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF), an industry standards group, has accelerated Carrier Ethernet adoption. The MEF establishes and maintains standards for manufacturers and Ethernet service providers, such as the E-NNI (Ethernet Network to Network Interface), which enables predictable and carrier-agnostic traffic exchange between networks. This allows carriers to expand their reach through peering arrangements via E-NNIs, accessing markets they don&amp;rsquo;t directly serve without laying fiber globally.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Level 3&amp;rsquo;s award-winning project involved providing Ethernet-based connectivity solutions for a major banking and financial services company throughout Brazil. An increasing number of large and medium-sized businesses are considering Ethernet services for interconnecting their locations worldwide. Smaller companies are also recognizing the cost benefits and seamless connectivity of Ethernet, making it a compelling choice when renewing contracts or setting up new installations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If your organization, regardless of size, seeks improved connectivity at lower costs compared to traditional telecom services, explore the pricing and features of Carrier Ethernet services.&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s part of the ISDN standards.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>PRI is often referred to as T1 PRI in regions like the USA, Canada, and Japan because it utilizes a T1 carrier trunk. However, there&amp;rsquo;s also a service simply called T1, making PRI appear as a variation of T1.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Traditional T1, known as channelized T1, carries 24 digitized conversations simultaneously using 24 channels of 8 bits each. To manage call signaling, one bit from each channel is repurposed, leaving 7 bits for the conversation. This method is called robbed bit signaling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>PRI offers an alternative T1 format. It provides 23 channels for calls and reserves the 24th channel solely for signaling. This grants each voice channel the full 8 bits for communication. Referred to as out-of-band signaling, this separate data channel offers more advanced features compared to robbed bit signaling, such as Caller ID and faster call setup and teardown, which are crucial for call centers and ISPs. PRI channels offer flexibility by configuring for inbound, outbound, or two-way communication.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When deciding between channelized T1 and PRI, consider your needs and equipment. If features like caller information for CTI, billing, or Caller ID display are crucial, then PRI is preferable. If these features aren&amp;rsquo;t essential and having all 24 channels for calls is more important, or your PBX system lacks PRI support, then channelized T1 is a suitable option.&lt;/p>

Due to limitations with Report Writer, VBA and RetrieveGlobals9.dll were used to modify the report.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following a recent update (GP 9 2010 YE Payroll Update - KB2435598, version 9.00.0386), the client reported issues with the report printing incorrectly, with edges being cut off. The problem persisted across different workstations and printers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Testing revealed that the issue occurred when printing directly to a printer, but not when printing to screen first. Further investigation pointed to the issue being related to the use of RetrieveGlobals9 within the VBA code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The root cause appears to be a bug introduced by the 2010 Year End update that affects report sections containing VBA code referencing RetrieveGlobals 9.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The issue is acknowledged in Microsoft KB Article 884601, which offers two workarounds: switching to a text-based report format (not ideal) or restructuring the VBA code to modify the scope of RetrieveGlobals and ADO objects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Initial tests with the code restructuring workaround show promise, though it may not be universally effective for all reports. The workaround involves:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Moving RetrieveGlobals and ADO variable declarations to the General Declarations section&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Instantiating RetrieveGlobals and ADO objects only in the Report Start event&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Utilizing the shared objects and variables within the report section event code&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This approach has resolved the printing problem in a development environment. Confirmation of resolution on the client&amp;rsquo;s server is pending. If this solution proves ineffective, an alternative workaround involves printing the report to screen first before printing to the physical printer.&lt;/p>

The release of the Apple iPad and its allowance of VoIP applications over 3G cellular networks, along with AT&amp;amp;T&amp;rsquo;s network adjustments for this capability, signal a potential shift in the telecommunications landscape.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why is this significant? Cellular networks have historically blocked VoIP due to its potential to congest networks and cannibalize voice call revenue. Traditional cellular systems were designed for voice calls, with data services as a more recent addition. Carriers allocate limited bandwidth between voice and data, and the introduction of unlimited data plans opened the door for users to bypass voice plans entirely using VoIP services like Skype.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, several factors are mitigating this concern. The rise of unlimited voice and data plans renders the distinction between voice and data usage less important for billing purposes. More importantly, the surge in bandwidth demand from data-intensive applications like video streaming is dwarfing voice call requirements. Carriers are rapidly upgrading infrastructure to accommodate this data explosion, shifting the focus from voice to data services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As data usage continues to dominate, the traditional model of voice minutes may become obsolete. Future pricing models might involve pay-as-you-go for all services or flat fees for unlimited usage. Cellular carriers will evolve into wireless broadband providers, catering to mobile devices capable of both voice and data communication. While traditional cellular service may decline, wireless technology will continue to thrive in this new data-centric landscape.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Restoration of the Arm Lowering Mechanism, Replacement of Tracking Sensor Light Bulb with a LED Assembly, and a New Aluminum Pulley</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-restoration-of-the-arm-lowering-mechanism-replacement-of-tracking-sensor-light-bulb-with-a-led-assembly-and-a-new-aluminum-pulley/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jun 2024 23:46:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-restoration-of-the-arm-lowering-mechanism-replacement-of-tracking-sensor-light-bulb-with-a-led-assembly-and-a-new-aluminum-pulley/</guid><description>&lt;p>My Beogram 4000 arrived damaged from shipping, so I began by fixing it. The carriage, which moves along a rod with bearings, had detached.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I took out the rod and bearings to put them back into the carriage correctly. Then, I used a wrench to secure them. This allowed me to reinstall the carriage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, I started my usual restoration process, beginning with the arm lowering mechanism. I took apart the solenoid, damper, connecting parts, and springs. I cleaned and lubricated everything before putting it back together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The connection between the damper and tonearm frequently gets stuck, so I tackled that next. I took out the sensor arm and linkage, which was tough to remove. After cleaning and greasing the pin, I reassembled everything and realigned the arm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The last step was replacing the tracking sensor&amp;rsquo;s light source. After removing the old bulb housing, I found that the aperture was out of place due to the shipping damage. I installed a 3D-printed LED assembly and a new machined aluminum pulley to complete the repair.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next step is restoring the carriage movement contacts, which I’ll cover in my next post.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>1,000,000 Miles of Metro Ethernet Fiber And Growing</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/1-000-000-miles-of-metro-ethernet-fiber-and-growing/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jun 2024 23:09:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/1-000-000-miles-of-metro-ethernet-fiber-and-growing/</guid><description>&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t assume Metro Ethernet is a small, insignificant service. XO Communications alone has a vast network of metro fiber, connecting thousands of buildings. And that&amp;rsquo;s just one provider, not even counting Ethernet over Copper options.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Metro Ethernet and its long-distance counterpart, Carrier Ethernet, are the future of telecommunications. The world is shifting from traditional circuit-based communication to packet-based IP networks. While your current internet might be a T1 line, your data likely transitions to an IP-based backbone at your provider&amp;rsquo;s location.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This transition makes it more efficient to use Ethernet technology throughout the network, from your device to the servers you access. With Ethernet in the WAN becoming as common as in your LAN, it&amp;rsquo;s a cost-effective solution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Curious about potential savings? You can easily compare Metro Ethernet prices and availability online. Websites like Ethernet Buildings simplify the process, allowing you to check options by simply entering your address.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even if your building doesn&amp;rsquo;t have fiber optic service yet, Ethernet over Copper or wireless options might be available. Providers like XO Communications are actively investing in these technologies to offer competitive services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t miss out on potential savings on your monthly telecom costs. Explore your options today – it only takes a few minutes and could lead to significant discounts. Check Ethernet service availability for your business location now.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The reason I do not accept foreign checks is due to the complexities of North American banking.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-reason-i-do-not-accept-foreign-checks-is-due-to-the-complexities-of-north-american-banking/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jun 2024 19:48:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-reason-i-do-not-accept-foreign-checks-is-due-to-the-complexities-of-north-american-banking/</guid><description>&lt;p>Years ago, I received a US dollar check from a Canadian Dynamics partner paying their invoice. They used their Canadian bank&amp;rsquo;s US dollar account, thinking it would simplify things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I assumed a US dollar check for a US dollar invoice would be straightforward. I was wrong.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My local Bank of America ATM wouldn&amp;rsquo;t accept the check. Inside, the teller and even the manager were perplexed. The manager confidently declared they couldn&amp;rsquo;t accept the check because it was a US dollar check from a Canadian bank. He claimed their policy prevented accepting checks where the origin country and currency differed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He instructed me to fill out a form and mail the check in a special envelope to &amp;ldquo;Foreign Clean Collections&amp;rdquo; for review and processing, which would take 6-8 weeks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Skeptical but curious, I followed their process. Weeks later, only $800 of the $1,000 appeared in my account. They deducted a $200 fee!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following this experience, I refused foreign checks, insisting on credit cards or wire transfers from international clients – a system that worked flawlessly for years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recently, a Canadian partner overlooked my clear instructions and sent a US dollar check from their Canadian bank. A colleague mentioned routinely depositing similar checks at their Bank of America branch without issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, having learned my lesson and paid the &amp;ldquo;Foreign Clean Collections Club&amp;rdquo; fee, I contacted my local branch for clarification.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first representative transferred me to the unavailable back office. Reaching the main customer service led to another dead end, as they couldn&amp;rsquo;t find information or connect me to the relevant department. Finally, the Foreign Exchange Call Center provided some insight.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Their stance? Every foreign check is reviewed individually. They had no clear policy on deposits, which essentially meant their policy was arbitrary and subject to the whims of individual branches and their training.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The branch might attempt to process the check through their system. This system, based on unknown algorithms, decides if the branch can accept the check. Acceptance supposedly means a standard deposit process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rejection initiates the &amp;ldquo;Foreign Clean Collections&amp;rdquo; process: forms, envelopes, weeks of waiting, and unpredictable fees. While they claim a flat $40 fee, the issuing bank might impose additional charges, like the $150 I was charged by the Canadian bank.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Their recommendation for receiving international payments? Wire transfers. They discouraged foreign checks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While some claim to deposit foreign checks without issue, I prefer to avoid the hassle of unreliable bank processes and potential fees. Checks are outdated, especially with modern alternatives like wire transfers and credit cards offering convenience and security.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wire transfers have existed for over a century and enable fast, international transfers with transparent fees. Credit cards are widely accepted, offer fraud protection and rewards, with the merchant (me) covering the fees. Services like TransferWise provide cost-effective international EFT transfers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The persistence of checks in North America seems rooted in the lack of fees for processing paper-based transactions, while electronic transfers incur charges.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After this latest investigation, my policy remains unchanged: credit cards or wire transfers from international clients. It&amp;rsquo;s a system that aligns with global banking practices.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fiber Optic Leased Lines for Business</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/fiber-optic-leased-lines-for-business/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jun 2024 18:49:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/fiber-optic-leased-lines-for-business/</guid><description>&lt;p>Traditional copper leased lines for business connectivity are becoming outdated in the face of increasing demand for bandwidth-intensive applications like big data, HD video, and cloud computing. Fiber optic lines are emerging as the preferred solution, offering lower prices and more choices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://www.FiberNetworkQuotes.com/images/EarthSpaceNightA250.jpg"

>http://www.fibernetworkquotes.com/&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While large companies and bandwidth-heavy industries have used fiber optic leased lines for a long time, the technology is now becoming more accessible. Historically, most fiber bandwidth relied on SONET (Synchronous Optical NETworking), a standard originating from the telephone industry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SONET picks up where copper-based T-carrier lines reach their limit. While T1 lines offer speeds up to 12 Mbps and T3 (DS3) lines provide 45 Mbps, SONET starts at 155 Mbps with OC-3 and scales up to much higher bandwidths.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SONET service levels increase in large increments, with OC-12 at 622 Mbps, OC-24 at 1.2 Gbps, OC-48 at 2.5 Gbps, OC-192 at 10 Gbps, and OC-768 at 40 Gbps. This large gap between levels may require businesses to purchase more bandwidth than needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a TDM (Time Division Multiplexed) technology, SONET divides the signal into small, synchronized channels, reflecting its telephony heritage. This setup requires protocol conversion for compatibility with packet-switched Ethernet networks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Despite needing protocol conversion, SONET is widely deployed and recognized for its reliability. Its ring topology, using two redundant fibers, ensures data flow even during network issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A newer alternative, Ethernet over Fiber (EoF), specifically Carrier Ethernet, offers advantages over SONET. Carrier Ethernet provides scalability, direct compatibility with existing networks, and cost savings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Carrier Ethernet offers various service levels, including 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps, and 10 Gbps, with the flexibility to select almost any bandwidth. Upgrading bandwidth is also simpler and faster with Carrier Ethernet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While relatively new, Carrier Ethernet is gaining popularity due to lower costs and scalability. This competition has driven down SONET prices, making fiber options more affordable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Businesses looking for increased bandwidth, better pricing on existing fiber connections, or optimal solutions for new applications should explore the options available with SONET and Ethernet fiber optic leased lines.&lt;/p>

Reconciling means performing these steps after each payroll:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Print the Check Register:&lt;/strong> This document, usually generated automatically after posting payroll, details your tax liabilities.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Print the Payroll Summary Report:&lt;/strong> Covering the current quarter up to the payroll check date (accessible via Reports-Payroll-Period End), this report should match your cumulative payroll check registers in terms of wages, taxes, etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Print the 941 Report:&lt;/strong> Also encompassing the current quarter, this report should align with the Payroll Summary Report for wages, taxes, etc. Additionally, its Schedule B should correspond with your check registers on a date basis.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Apply this same process for state taxes: compare the state tax register generated during payroll posting with the state tax summary from Reports-Payroll-Period End. This cumulative approach helps catch off-cycle changes, voids, and simplifies quarterly reconciliation by allowing ongoing comparison with your accumulating 941 data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Addressing discrepancies becomes easier when you know the originating payroll or adjustment period. However, unforeseen circumstances happen. If you need to backtrack and reconcile multiple payrolls, particularly after going live, a helpful check is ensuring the tax flags on individual employee pay codes, benefits, and deductions match the overall setup (compare Cards-Payroll to Setup-Payroll). The provided script accomplishes this for pay codes but can be adjusted for benefits or deductions.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Toll-free numbers are beneficial for businesses with a public phone number. Local customers can call without long-distance charges, but even calls from nearby areas can become expensive. Out-of-state prospects might hesitate to call due to high long-distance rates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Offering a toll-free number encourages calls from anywhere, as the business covers the cost. Customers often expect toll-free numbers for sales and support, making businesses without them appear less credible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What callers don&amp;rsquo;t realize is the affordability. Toll-free numbers can be registered for as low as $2 with a $2 monthly fee, making them accessible to businesses of all sizes. Per-minute charges apply only for received calls, starting at 6.9 cents for calls within the contiguous U.S. This cost-effective approach ensures you&amp;rsquo;re connecting with serious leads and customers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kall8 Toll Free Service enhances this with features like voicemail, call blocking, caller ID, call forwarding, and conference calling. Uniquely, Kall8 allows you to direct incoming toll-free calls to any number – office, home, or cell – providing flexibility and ensuring missed calls are minimized, especially for professionals on the go.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kall8 also caters to mobile professionals by integrating fax-to-email and voicemail-to-email features, allowing access to messages from anywhere with an internet connection.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This comprehensive service is surprisingly affordable, starting at $2 per month. Additional features include detailed call reports accessible through an online control panel. The versatility of this service extends to marketing agencies, who can utilize multiple toll-free numbers to track responses to individual ads. With their cost-effectiveness, toll-free numbers become an invaluable business tool.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Last Minute Online Gifts For Good</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/last-minute-online-gifts-for-good/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jun 2024 09:58:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/last-minute-online-gifts-for-good/</guid><description>&lt;p>_On Christmas Eve, instead of the typical peaceful house,&lt;br>

&lt;p>Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) offers a solution. While not a fully private cloud, it comes close.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>VPLS allows you to share a private multipoint network built on technology like Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS). MPLS networks can handle various traffic types, including Ethernet, making it ideal for diverse needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>VPLS is essentially an Ethernet-based mesh network over an MPLS network. It uses pseudo-wires to create connections between any two points, creating a unified network experience. This makes geographically distant locations feel like parts of a single large office.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While beneficial within a metropolitan area, VPLS can connect sites across cities and even countries, limited only by the provider&amp;rsquo;s reach.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, even provider reach is no longer a limiting factor, thanks to Ethernet Exchanges like Telx. These exchanges connect multiple carriers, extending the potential reach of VPLS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>VPLS offers a cost-effective and efficient solution for organizations with multiple locations looking to connect their voice, video, and data networks seamlessly. To determine if VPLS is right for you, check the cost and availability of services in your area.&lt;/p>

This core transmission protocol, unlike its namesake, isn&amp;rsquo;t something most consumers encounter directly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ATM is a technology that falls into the same family as Ethernet, Frame Relay, and TDM. Although once considered a potential universal networking solution, it didn&amp;rsquo;t achieve that status. Nonetheless, a significant portion of telecom providers, around 80%, currently utilize ATM within their networks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This might seem surprising given the buzz around Ethernet advancements like Fast, Gigabit, and 10 Gigabit Ethernet. ATM&amp;rsquo;s relevance stems from its design, intended to handle any digitized voice, video, or data protocol by packaging them into small, uniform 53-byte packets (cells) with 5 bytes for the header and 48 for data. Larger data streams are divided among multiple cells.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This uniform cell structure simplifies network operations, allowing for hardware-based packet handling which is more efficient. This efficiency makes it suitable for high-speed optical carrier networks like OC3 and OC12, where ATM finds its primary application, and even scales up to OC48 and beyond.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ATM networks utilize switches instead of routers because data travels over predetermined virtual circuits on virtual paths, ensuring all cells follow the same route from origin to destination, maintaining their order. This is crucial for voice and video transmission, minimizing jitter and ensuring smooth, synchronized delivery.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>IP routing, conversely, can direct packets through different paths. While this adds robustness by enabling rerouting in case of network disruptions, it introduces variable packet arrival times, leading to delays and jitter. Such inconsistencies disrupt real-time data streams like voice or video, rendering out-of-sequence packets useless.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Despite its strengths, ATM is unlikely to dominate the networking landscape. Initially, it was projected to replace Ethernet as the latter&amp;rsquo;s speed limits were anticipated to become inadequate. However, Ethernet evolved with faster speeds and enhancements, solidifying its dominance in local area networks (LANs). Consequently, ATM found its niche in metropolitan and wide area networks (WANs), creating a division where LANs typically use Ethernet and WANs utilize ATM.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The push for a standardized IP environment is leading to end-to-end Ethernet deployments, simplifying network management. Whether WAN trunks will fully transition to a native IP format or simply carry IP over ATM remains to be seen. However, ATM might see renewed relevance as digitized voice and video traffic increases within networks.&lt;/p>

While upgrading from a T1 line to a DS3 might have seemed expensive in the past, prices have gone down. Even with the current economic climate, a DS3 connection could now be within your budget.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>DS3, or Data Service level 3, is a digital telecommunications standard initially designed for telephone systems. It&amp;rsquo;s part of the T-Carrier system and works seamlessly with SONET fiber optic networks. A DS3 line typically offers 45 Mbps. Though once delivered via coaxial copper cable, most DS3 connections now utilize fiber optic cables. A single DS3 uses only a small portion of the fiber&amp;rsquo;s capacity, allowing for multiple DS3s to be bundled and transmitted across long distances.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What are the uses of DS3? Large companies might use a dedicated DS3 internet connection to support numerous employees, potentially up to hundreds. When used for telephone services, a single DS3 connection can handle up to 672 simultaneous calls. This capacity is suitable for large corporations or call centers needing extensive phone service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The cost of a DS3 connection is often quoted around $5,000 per month. However, this price can be significantly lower, potentially half, based on your location and the length of the contract. Areas with a denser population usually have more DS3 availability and competition among providers, leading to better prices. Online tools are available to get a DS3 quote for your business address in a matter of minutes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What if installing fiber optic cable at your location isn&amp;rsquo;t feasible? Another option, Ethernet over Copper (EoC), is gaining popularity in urban areas. EoC&amp;rsquo;s bandwidth varies depending on the distance from the provider&amp;rsquo;s Point of Presence (POP) but can reach DS3 levels of 45 Mbps. You can obtain a quote for Ethernet over Copper bandwidth online. Where available, this service is typically more affordable than DS3 on a per-Mbps basis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even if your business is located in a remote area without access to fiber optic cables, there are still voice and data connection solutions. Bonded T1 lines, which combine multiple pairs of standard telephone cables, can provide speeds of 10 Mbps or more. This option gives you cost control because you determine the number of lines to bond, allowing you to match your needs and budget and upgrade as your demands increase. Request a quote for bonded T1 service to see the affordability for your location.&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s a disaster, leading to lost sales and potentially losing valuable customers. If customers go elsewhere during downtime, they may never return, putting your business at risk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While numerous risks can disrupt your business, connectivity is one you can control. Most businesses, even traditional brick-and-mortar ones, rely heavily on electronic connections like phones and the internet to operate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Losing these vital connections can be devastating. While a hotdog vendor might not be affected, businesses like stockbrokers or online retailers with on-site servers would be crippled. Point-of-sale system failures can bring businesses to a standstill.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This raises the question of using a &amp;ldquo;costly&amp;rdquo; T1 line versus a &amp;ldquo;budget-friendly&amp;rdquo; DSL or Cable Modem connection. While they might offer similar advertised bandwidth (e.g., 1.5 Mbps), DSL&amp;rsquo;s lower cost of $50-$150 per month can be tempting compared to a T1&amp;rsquo;s significantly higher price. Why would a cost-conscious business choose to pay more for seemingly the same service?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When everything functions flawlessly, the differences might seem negligible. However, T1 dedicated internet provides symmetrical upload and download speeds and dedicated bandwidth, generally outperforming business DSL and consumer-grade internet services. But the true value of T1 lies in its service guarantee.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>T1 lines come with a Service Level Agreement (SLA), a contractual agreement outlining the provider&amp;rsquo;s response time to outages and the compensation you receive during downtime. This &amp;ldquo;insurance policy&amp;rdquo; incentivizes the provider to address and resolve issues swiftly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In contrast, DSL or Cable modem internet offers &amp;ldquo;best effort&amp;rdquo; service without guaranteed performance levels. While providers will work to restore service, the time frame can be unpredictable, ranging from hours to days. T1 downtime usually receives attention within 30 minutes to a maximum of 4 hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Therefore, the true cost comparison between T1 and DSL goes beyond the advertised price. Consider the potential financial impact of downtime on your business. How much revenue would you lose in an hour, a day, or two? Could it be $1,000, $5,000, or even $10,000? If so, that seemingly affordable DSL connection could become significantly more expensive after a single outage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The emergence of VoIP has further intertwined phone service with internet connectivity. Losing a DSL connection that supports your phones, computers, and web server can be completely paralyzing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While only you can determine the specific risk to your business, alternatives to consumer-grade connectivity exist. Integrated T1 services, for instance, combine traditional phone lines and internet access on a single T1 line, potentially saving money compared to multiple phone lines and a separate DSL connection, all while benefiting from an SLA. Another option is a fractional T1 line, providing a portion of the bandwidth at a reduced cost while retaining the crucial service level agreement.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>T1 Rex partners with numerous top-tier service providers, offering competitive pricing on various T1 solutions, including dedicated internet access, integrated voice and data service, fractional T1 lines, and local/long-distance phone lines. Their team of experts can guide you in selecting the most cost-effective service for your specific business needs.

Should they stick with their existing Key Telephone or PBX system and upgrade it, or is it time to transition to VoIP? What many businesses may not realize is the wide range of options that VoIP solutions offer.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/a>The key difference between VoIP and traditional phone systems lies in its network-based approach. While even a single-line phone or cell phone operates on a network, known as the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), this network has limitations. It excels at connecting individual phones or facilitating conference calls but operates within its own technology and wiring constraints. In contrast, VoIP is designed to function seamlessly with standard computer networks that utilize packets of data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This fundamental difference highlights the adaptability of VoIP. Similar to connecting a computer or printer, an IP phone simply plugs into a network jack, eliminating the need for specialized wiring. Location becomes irrelevant as IP phones are identified by unique addresses rather than physical connections.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Traditional phone systems require businesses to choose between connecting each phone directly to the phone company or implementing an in-house phone system to share outside lines. VoIP offers similar flexibility, allowing for an in-house system called an IP PBX or extending the network to a service provider through Hosted VoIP or Hosted PBX. This connection, known as a SIP Trunk, offers several advantages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SIP Trunking allows businesses to consolidate their phone and internet services with a single provider. The SIP trunk can be configured to prioritize voice and data packets, preventing disruptions to calls during data-intensive activities. This combined approach often leads to cost savings compared to separate phone lines and internet connections.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hosted PBX services provide businesses with unparalleled flexibility in phone placement. Beyond simply rearranging phones within an office, a hosted PBX enables phones in different geographical locations to function seamlessly as if they were under one roof. This capability, known as a virtual office, is made possible by SIP trunks connecting phones, regardless of their physical location.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For larger enterprises, robust VoIP systems manage hundreds or even thousands of phones distributed across headquarters, regional offices, and branches. Private SIP Trunks securely facilitate voice and data transmission between these locations, bypassing expensive phone company charges for internal calls. The central PBX system can be located on-site or hosted, offering flexibility and scalability. One of the most significant advantages of hosted VoIP is its pay-as-you-go model, eliminating the need for substantial upfront investments in equipment and dedicated staff for maintenance and upgrades.&lt;/p>

The error message, &amp;ldquo;You must have the Microsoft Save as PDF or XPS Add-in for 2007 Microsoft Office installed to send documents,&amp;rdquo; persisted even with Office 2010 (32-bit) installed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This error, encountered by others as well, hinted at a problem with GP&amp;rsquo;s ability to convert and email reports as PDFs. While emailing DOCX files worked, PDF conversion failed. Interestingly, the same process worked flawlessly on a second server with a default Office 2010 installation, suggesting a server-specific issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Suspecting my minimalist Office installation, I realized I had excluded the &amp;ldquo;.NET Programmability Support&amp;rdquo; feature under Microsoft Word during installation. I typically disable unused features, but this omission proved problematic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After reinstalling Office 2010 with &amp;ldquo;.NET Programmability Support&amp;rdquo; enabled, GP 2010 R2 successfully emailed PDF attachments. This component, though seemingly unrelated, is vital for GP&amp;rsquo;s PDF conversion process during emailing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While other factors can cause this error, my experience highlights a less obvious one. My meticulous Office setup inadvertently led to this issue, showcasing the importance of this specific Word 2010 feature for seamless PDF emailing in GP 2010.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cellular Netbooks Are Downright Cheap</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/cellular-netbooks-are-downright-cheap/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jun 2024 12:51:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/cellular-netbooks-are-downright-cheap/</guid><description>&lt;p>Do you spend most of your computing time on the go? If so, a computer designed for mobility might be perfect for you, like one of the new netbooks with built-in 3G cellular internet access.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You might be thinking laptops aren&amp;rsquo;t that bulky and work fine at a coffee shop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s true. A laptop with a wireless modem aircard would be comparable to a netbook in functionality. However, laptops are heavier and often carry unnecessary extras.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Netbooks prioritize mobile computing, being half the size and weight of standard laptops. They boast larger screens than smartphones and spacious QWERTY keyboards, outperforming smartphones and messaging-focused phones for internet use. Moreover, they have hard drives, fast processors, and enough RAM to handle a standard operating system like Windows XP Home Edition, which is used in several popular models.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Netbooks omit CD or DVD drives as they are designed for online operation, not for complex image editing or playing DVDs. You can enjoy multimedia content online as needed. As internet-centric devices, netbooks are shifting towards integrated 3G cellular wireless connectivity alongside standard WiFi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With 3G wireless, you can access the internet from anywhere with cellular service. While the wireless modem aircards in netbooks only utilize the data signals from cell towers and not voice, they enable web browsing and emailing from your car, the bus, or a client&amp;rsquo;s office. Need to finalize a deal? Grab your netbook and enter the order right there with your customer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Netbooks are more affordable than laptops, ranging from $300 to $600. You can even snag one for a steal by bundling it with a cellular data plan. For instance, an Acer Aspire One with a two-year AT&amp;amp;T 3G wireless plan can be yours for $49.99. Similar to cell phone subsidies, the carrier offsets the netbook cost. This deal requires a 2-year, 5 GB monthly data plan for $60 per month.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To explore current cell phone deals and free phone offers, use the Cell Phone Plan Finder to compare top phones and their associated wireless plans. You can also purchase netbooks without a data plan at a higher price and rely on WiFi hotspots for internet access.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If a smartphone or an internet-enabled cell phone like a BlackBerry is more your style, explore the free and budget-friendly options currently on Cell Phone Plans Finder.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>November in New York&amp;rsquo;s Finger Lakes region has been delightfully mild. I even took this photo of my garden from the roof two days ago.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The tarp in the foreground is full of shredded leaves ready to be spread. The leaves will act as mulch for the winter. You can see several raised beds on the garden&amp;rsquo;s right side with oats and mustard cover crops. I recently harvested the carrots from the two remaining beds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the left, you can see my new project: 30&amp;quot; x 30&amp;quot; garden beds framed in black plastic. I&amp;rsquo;m excited to share more about them next year. I ran out of time to plant a cover crop, but at least they are ready for spring planting. Here&amp;rsquo;s a closer look&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiTpYxhyphenhyphenxeWhs9GR1_AnKB70n4RaOuCD97EBwKTuSp-pWvGhU8Vp-h3g856YtnOVxldrTM47CP5r_lKvRYYA_d-cmpC6xG54vuPUj2-t1IRQveW1pkbl8eUO_RM0Cbdf4iNQUu1xLFuHGk/s1600/IMG_2036.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>These new beds are prepped with shredded leaves mixed into the first few inches of soil and then topped with a thick layer. It will be interesting to see how much they decompose by spring. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard the soil organisms, like earthworms, can stay active under the snow all winter.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A recent conversation about knots, sparked by my post on un-bungee cords, reminded me of a daring experience from the early 1980s: my first rappelling adventure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the time, I was working as a carpenter for Clancy Edmonds, who had hired Dan, a machinist, for the summer. Dan, a memorable character who rode a Harley Davidson and carried a .357 magnum, even convinced me to get my handgun permit, arguing it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be as easy in the future. He was right.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dan had a friend named Chip who was an experienced rock climber. When I expressed my interest in the activity, they offered to teach me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We decided to rappel Carpenter Falls in Niles, New York, a place I had discovered while exploring my new neighborhood. It was a secluded and beautiful spot, a stark contrast to the suburban environment I was used to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today, Carpenter Falls is a protected nature preserve named after Hu Bahar, a remarkable man I had the pleasure of meeting through a mutual connection. However, back then, it was a popular, albeit sometimes dangerous, spot for weekend gatherings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unaware of any restrictions, we set out on our adventure. Chip, who had the necessary equipment, provided us with a quick lesson. He stressed the importance of the figure-eight knot, claiming that every rock climber should master it even when inebriated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We secured the ropes to a small tree near the edge of the falls – I had my doubts about its stability – and Chip went first, demonstrating the technique. With my boss and Marlene watching from below, I followed suit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rappelling down Carpenter Falls wasn&amp;rsquo;t straightforward; the lack of footholds meant relying solely on controlled rope descent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Halfway down, disaster struck. My t-shirt got caught in the equipment, leaving me stranded. Chip, after observing my predicament, climbed back up and, with a well-placed cut, freed me. Relieved, I completed the descent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Both Dan and Tim had their turn, sharing in the exhilaration. I went once more but that was the extent of my rappelling career.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="heading">&lt;/h3>

This particular Beogram 4002 (5513) had deep scratches on its hood.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The restoration started by sanding with 220-grit sandpaper, then progressively moved to finer grits (320-grit shown). This process, which took about 3 hours and involved around 10 polishing steps with Micro-Mesh up to 12000 level, returned the hood to a translucent and shiny condition.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The rubber bumpers on the hood corners had deteriorated, leaving only embedded remnants. These remnants were drilled out using a 2mm drill bit. New bumpers were fashioned from sections of a 2mm O-ring, secured with super glue gel, and trimmed to a 1mm length for proper hood alignment.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/a>&lt;strong>The New Normal: Where is Everyone?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A small team remains onsite, but the majority of employees are working from home. There&amp;rsquo;s been a massive effort to establish remote connections using personal computers, iPads, and smartphones, relying on cable and cellular broadband. Consequently, bandwidth usage has surged by 30% or more. Video conferencing has become indispensable, with platforms like Skype, Zoom, FaceTime, RingCentral, GoToMeeting, and Webex taking center stage, utilizing built-in microphones and cameras.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>This is Not a Temporary Situation&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s tempting to believe that this disruption to our work lives is temporary. That in a few short weeks, things will return to normal. This is likely wishful thinking. While the pandemic might be peaking or has peaked in areas hit early and hard, it&amp;rsquo;s far from over. The crisis will continue to unfold in other regions that were not initially affected and have only recently implemented lockdowns. It will be like a rolling disaster, moving from city to city, even reaching less populated regions. Just as we start to feel like it&amp;rsquo;s behind us, a resurgence of infections is predicted for the fall.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Effective treatments and vaccines are anticipated, but they are likely months, if not a year or more, away. While the situation may not remain a constant crisis, it&amp;rsquo;s safe to say that it won&amp;rsquo;t be business as usual for a while. We must adapt and discover how to maintain successful businesses without large groups of people in a single workspace or close contact between employees and clients.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Essential Tools for the Virtual Business&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mastering distributed processes, secure communications, and remote operations is critical. VPNs will be crucial for security, while private and public cloud services will host the software that drives businesses. Robust bandwidth will connect it all together. &amp;ldquo;Touchless&amp;rdquo; interactions will be the new standard, with technology replacing hands-on activities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What kind of bandwidth will be necessary? Basic home broadband won&amp;rsquo;t suffice. Remote employees may not have access to the high-performance business-grade private lines often used in offices. They will, however, require dependable bandwidth for video conferencing with coworkers, management, and customers, ensuring that home computers function as seamlessly as their office counterparts. While cable broadband might be adequate in some instances, remote areas may require an SD-WAN solution that combines cable, T1, WISP, 4G and 5G cellular, and even satellite connectivity for a comprehensive solution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Bandwidth-Intensive Industries&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Medical facilities, labs, and hospitals demand high-performance bandwidth solutions such as Gigabit Ethernet, 10 GigE fiber, dark fiber, and MPLS networks. These connections are crucial for linking distant facilities or collaborating organizations. While readily available in densely populated areas, these solutions pose a greater challenge in rural locations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>IT Bandwidth Requirements: Re-evaluated&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The need for IT department connectivity has changed. High-performance, dedicated bandwidth connections to public, private, and hybrid cloud services will be essential. These connections offer faster, more responsive, and stable experiences than standard internet connections, providing a &amp;ldquo;LAN-like&amp;rdquo; quality from any business location. Dedicated point-to-point fiber optic lines, Metro Ethernet services, and MPLS networks that span large geographical regions, including global coverage, can achieve this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Aftermath&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While this crisis will eventually pass, things may never return to the way they were. Businesses may find themselves surprised by the productivity of their remote workforce, even with the presence of children and pets. The truth is that those cubicles often saw a lot of socializing, personal internet use, and non-work-related emails. Allowing a large portion of employees to work remotely eliminates their commute and, potentially, childcare costs. It also reduces the need for physical office space. As a result, performance management may shift from monitoring physical presence to focusing on goal-oriented outcomes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can expect a significant increase in remote work, with core teams potentially operating from smaller facilities or shared workspaces. Video conferencing may replace many business trips once considered essential. It&amp;rsquo;s possible to achieve the same, if not higher, levels of productivity at a reduced cost while increasing flexibility. Moreover, securing additional help could become faster and more cost-effective without the need for relocation.&lt;/p>

However, local storage is still necessary. While Storage Attached Networks (SANs) are a common solution, they&amp;rsquo;re expensive and complex. A simpler option exists.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://www.CloudNetworkingServices.com/images/HardDriveOpen250.jpg"
loading="lazy"
alt="Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about individual drive failures when you have a Drobo."
>Introducing Drobo, an advanced hard disk storage solution that&amp;rsquo;s surprisingly easy to use. It works with standard 3.5&amp;quot; SATA drives of any capacity, resembling a straightforward multi-bay drive enclosure. Adding or removing drives, even swapping a 1 TB for a 2 TB, is always possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You might think this flexibility requires complicated administration, but it&amp;rsquo;s truly plug and play. No need for arcane command lines or admin panels – everything&amp;rsquo;s automated and user-friendly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Essentially, you&amp;rsquo;re building your own private storage cloud on-site. This eliminates bandwidth concerns for real-time data access, as the unit sits on your network.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;re likely familiar with RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Drives), which safeguards data against drive failures. Drobo goes further with &amp;ldquo;BeyondRAID.&amp;rdquo; Unlike RAID, it accommodates drives of varying sizes. Connect any six SATA drives to a Drobo, and the system automatically configures redundant storage, creating a combined storage pool without limitations from the smallest disk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This aligns with the cloud philosophy – you don&amp;rsquo;t worry about the technical details. Need more space? Add a drive. Bays full? Swap a smaller drive for a larger one. The system adapts, providing extra capacity without data loss.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Upgrading is also effortless. Transitioning from a 9-bay to a 12-bay system (up to 24 TB) involves moving drives to the new unit. Don&amp;rsquo;t remember the order? No problem. Plug them in anywhere, add new ones, and you&amp;rsquo;re set. Status lights turn green when the system is ready.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sound too good to be true? Explore their materials and watch the demo videos. Drobo units begin at four bays for small offices, scaling upwards to meet your needs.&lt;/p>

They were puzzled by the activity in a particular account from January to March, seeing only a $100 credit in January, a $50 debit in February, and a $200 credit in March. They wondered why each month didn&amp;rsquo;t show both debits and credits.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It took me a moment to realize that, unlike my usual practice of migrating both debit and credit activity for complete GL history, someone else had migrated only the net change for each period from their old system. This was likely because their previous system made it difficult to download detailed period activity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This situation reminded me how important it is to migrate both debits and credits for clarity, especially for new users looking back at historical data. Plus, it usually doesn&amp;rsquo;t take any extra time if the data is accessible. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in hearing your approaches to GL history migration – how do you handle these situations?&lt;/p>

The keypad is now responsive, but the cueing up and down button is overly sensitive and needs further attention.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The RPM panel re-installation was put on hold because the plastic mounting fixtures were cracked, a common issue with Beogram 4002 turntables. I was fortunate that the cracks weren&amp;rsquo;t severe and the fixtures were still usable. To repair them, I used acrylic repair fluid while pressing the pieces together. Since this fix alone isn&amp;rsquo;t durable enough for frequent removal and re-installation, I reinforced it with Dura-Lar strips and epoxy on both sides of each mounting block.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The repaired mounting blocks attach to the aluminum frame with set screws located underneath. It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that the mounting screw for both the keypad and the RPM indicator panel sits directly below the RPM panel. This means the panel must be removed to access the keypad buttons or phono output board, highlighting the necessity of reinforcing the mounting blocks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, I focused on verifying the voltages and signals from the Beogram&amp;rsquo;s detectors. The first check was the 4D1 LED and 4IC1 optical sensor, which detect the tangential arm&amp;rsquo;s position. The sensor reacts to light changes as the arm moves along the acrylic slide.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following the service manual, I measured the voltage at the collector of the 4IC1 sensor with a transparent section of the slide between the LED and sensor. The voltage should be around 5V, and if not, adjusted using the 1R88 trimmer on the main board.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This adjustment is crucial because the run-out groove detection at the end of a record relies on a correctly set voltage level.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, I examined the fixed arm sensor, responsible for detecting the presence of a record and determining if it&amp;rsquo;s safe to lower the tonearm. The fixed arm has a light source directed at the platter, and an optical sensor reads the reflected light. A consistent, dim light signal, indicating a record is present, allows the stylus to be lowered. Without a record, the platter&amp;rsquo;s black ribs interrupt the reflected light, creating pulses that prevent the stylus from lowering.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This sensor&amp;rsquo;s signal needs to function correctly and at the appropriate level.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The sensor is producing pulses exceeding the required 6 volts, ensuring the tonearm won&amp;rsquo;t lower onto an empty platter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before checking the end groove and run-out stop circuit, I wanted to complete some mechanical checks and adjustments to prepare the Beogram for playback. I was pleased to find the platter-to-tonearm height was already at the required 23mm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The arm lowering limit needed setting to ensure the stylus tip is approximately 1mm from the top of the first platter rib. This safety measure safeguards the cartridge from damage if the record detection circuit fails.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another mechanical adjustment involved checking the tonearm&amp;rsquo;s length and parallelism. By running a string tangent to the Beogram arm assembly, I could visually confirm the stylus followed the string&amp;rsquo;s path.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had previously confirmed the 7.7mm distance and parallelism between the tonearm and fixed arm when disassembling and cleaning the tonearm assembly earlier in the restoration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With those steps completed, record playback is getting closer. The remaining tasks include fine-tuning the tracking sensor sensitivity, verifying the run-off stop function, and calibrating the platter speeds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Adjusting the tracking sensor was relatively smooth, though it involved several iterations to achieve the desired sensitivity where the tangential arm motor moves after the correct number of revolutions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The run-off stop check on the oscilloscope showed good results. I successfully adjusted trimmers 1R14 and 1R15 on the main board to set the 33⅓ RPM and 45 RPM speeds using the Beolover RPM tool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These Beograms require a lot of adjustments and checks, but their exceptional design makes them well worth the effort.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, it&amp;rsquo;s time for a break with food and fireworks – away from the Beogram, of course. Afterward, I&amp;rsquo;ll make a quick adjustment to the keypad cueing button, and then it&amp;rsquo;s time to relax and enjoy some vinyl.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>DIA and VPN For Europe</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/dia-and-vpn-for-europe/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jun 2024 15:09:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/dia-and-vpn-for-europe/</guid><description>&lt;p>Level 3 Communications, a major internet services provider with a global reach, is expanding its Dedicated Internet Access (DIA) and Virtual Private Network (VPN) services into European markets, including France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. The company recognizes the increasing importance of international connectivity for business success in a globalized marketplace.&lt;/p>

alt="DIA and VPN network services for European, as well as other international markets. Click for pricing and availability."
>&lt;/a> While large corporations often manage their own private networks, many businesses need reliable internet access without the high investment. These businesses require high-quality internet for e-commerce, customer communication, and connecting geographically dispersed locations. Dedicated Internet Access is a popular choice for businesses as it provides exclusive bandwidth, unlike shared bandwidth options like DSL or cable broadband, where speeds can vary depending on user activity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With DIA, businesses have a guaranteed bandwidth speed, such as 1.5 Mbps for T1 lines or 2.0 Mbps for E1 lines, for both uploads and downloads. Ethernet connections are gaining popularity as a scalable alternative to T1/E1 lines, offering speeds from 1 Mbps to 10 Gbps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>VPNs provide a secure way to utilize the internet by encrypting data and creating a &amp;ldquo;tunnel&amp;rdquo; for secure transmission. This is particularly useful for companies with multiple locations or employees working remotely. VPNs eliminate the need for costly dedicated lines, allowing businesses of all sizes to connect securely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are two common VPN methods: IPSec, which requires dedicated software, and SSL, which utilizes web browsers and is commonly used for secure online transactions.&lt;/p>

Connecting these branches seamlessly without breaking the bank is a common challenge. Thankfully, two high-performance networking technologies, Metro Ethernet and MPLS Networks, offer affordable solutions that weren&amp;rsquo;t available even a decade ago.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Carrier Ethernet takes the local networking capabilities of Ethernet and extends them across entire cities. This means easy connection and efficient transmission without needing protocol conversions. Since the entire network, both local and wide area, can use level 2 switching, branch offices can access resources just like the main office. This Ethernet approach also tends to be cheaper than traditional telecom options due to increased competition.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MPLS, or Multi-Protocol Label Switching, is another option. It creates secure, high-performance networks capable of transporting various data types. Many providers now use MPLS for its ability to control network factors like jitter and latency, making it perfect for combined voice and data networks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ethernet and MPLS are very compatible. Companies often use Ethernet for local connections and MPLS for long-distance links, creating a powerful and flexible network.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you need to connect branch offices, explore the pricing and availability of Ethernet and MPLS services. You might be surprised at the options available.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Myth #1: All adjusting entries must be finalized before closing the General Ledger.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is false. Dynamics GP allows posting to the most recent historical year. After closing 2009, for instance, adjustments can still be made to it, just not to 2008. This requires enabling &amp;ldquo;allow posting to history&amp;rdquo; in GL setup and ensuring the fiscal period is open in Fiscal Period Setup.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Myth #2: The general ledger year-end close process is stuck if it appears unresponsive.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The year-end close is a demanding process, often causing temporary unresponsiveness. Patience is key. Interrupting the process using Ctrl-Alt-Delete is strongly discouraged and necessitates restoring from a backup. Always have backups and be patient.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Myth #3: Creating an audit period provides a comprehensive view of audit entries.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While creating a 13th period for audit entries seems clever, issues arise with financial reconciliation. This process might misattribute postings, causing inaccuracies. A better solution is using a dedicated source document code (e.g., &amp;ldquo;AJ&amp;rdquo; for adjusting entries) for easy tracking via the Cross Reference by Source Document report.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Myth #4: Closing the Fixed Assets year is as simple as changing the year on the books.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Incorrect. Always use the dedicated Fixed Asset year-end closing routine. Manually altering the year on the books is not advised and may require restoring from a backup. Additionally, complete all prior-year activities in Fixed Assets before starting new-year activities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Myth #5: The timing of closing Receivables and Payables is flexible.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The year-end close for Payables and Receivables impacts the &amp;ldquo;Amounts Since Last Close&amp;rdquo; summaries, crucial for accurate reporting. Performing these closes near the actual year-end, after posting most prior-year activity, ensures the most precise figures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, a $500 payable posted on January 1, 2010, but before closing the year on January 2, 2010, will be attributed to the previous year in the &amp;ldquo;Amounts Since Last Close&amp;rdquo; summary. Conversely, a $1,000 payable posted on January 3, 2010, after the year-end close, will be allocated to the current year, even if backdated to December 20, 2009.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While these discrepancies might seem minor, they can create inconsistencies in vendor or customer summaries and year-over-year comparisons.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Clearing the Dynamics GP User ID field on Terminal Servers</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/clearing-the-dynamics-gp-user-id-field-on-terminal-servers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jun 2024 01:11:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/clearing-the-dynamics-gp-user-id-field-on-terminal-servers/</guid><description>&lt;p>This article addresses a known issue in Dynamics GP, specifically regarding user ID retention on Terminal Servers. While convenient for single users, this feature can be disruptive in multi-user environments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The issue arises when multiple users log in and out of Dynamics GP on a Terminal Server. The system tends to remember the last user&amp;rsquo;s ID, forcing subsequent users to manually replace it with their own. This behavior, though seemingly minor, can be perceived as a security concern or simply an annoyance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One effective solution involves using a VBA script, as outlined in KB Article 859129, &amp;ldquo;Blank User ID in Great Plains&amp;rdquo;. This script clears the User ID field upon login, providing a straightforward resolution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Previously, making the Dex.ini file read-only was suggested as a solution. However, this method is no longer recommended. For more details, refer to the reader comments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While making the Dex.ini file read-only might seem effective in clearing the last user ID, it can have unintended consequences. This file stores various user preferences that enhance the Dynamics GP experience. Making it read-only prevents not only the saving of the last user ID but also other helpful settings, potentially leading to new issues or user inconvenience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This method&amp;rsquo;s lack of documentation in the Knowledge Base and potential for side effects suggest it may not be a supported solution. It&amp;rsquo;s important to weigh the drawbacks before implementing such a fix.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): Rebuilding the Output Board, Installation of a Grounding Switch and Repair of the Keypad</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-rebuilding-the-output-board-installation-of-a-grounding-switch-and-repair-of-the-keypad/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jun 2024 19:38:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-rebuilding-the-output-board-installation-of-a-grounding-switch-and-repair-of-the-keypad/</guid><description>&lt;p>My Beogram 4002 (5513) restoration is almost done.

&lt;p>The red switch allows for the connection of the system and signal grounds. This helps resolve any humming from faulty connections in the amplifier or cable (especially when using RCA adapters without a system ground breakout).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before reinstalling the board, I repaired the keypad. One key was popping up due to a loose key stop:&lt;/p>

Which one is the right fit? Here&amp;rsquo;s a breakdown of what&amp;rsquo;s available and what makes sense for home-based work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Residential broadband services are often the best choice for home offices, primarily because they&amp;rsquo;re the most affordable. These services are usually confined to residential areas. While businesses in commercial zones might have access to cable broadband, they often pay double the price for a similar connection with potentially enhanced customer service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Besides cost, residential broadband suits home offices because occasional brief outages and fluctuating bandwidths are generally acceptable in exchange for savings. If a 20-minute outage wouldn&amp;rsquo;t disrupt your workflow, residential broadband is a cost-effective choice. Additionally, consider your VoIP needs. If you&amp;rsquo;re using VoIP phones, ensure the bandwidth can handle decent call quality with minimal drops. A single broadband connection might be sufficient for both your phone and internet usage with a good router that prioritizes voice packets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finding the best residential broadband deal is simple with online tools. Using a service like &amp;ldquo;Can I Get DSL?&amp;rdquo; helps you quickly compare available options and prices by entering your information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that these search engines need your landline phone number to pinpoint your location accurately. This is crucial because broadband services are location-dependent; what&amp;rsquo;s available to your neighbor might not be accessible to you. DSL, in particular, relies on high-frequency signals transmitted through existing telephone lines, limiting its reach. This distance constraint applies to both residential and business DSL.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you don&amp;rsquo;t have a landline and rely solely on a cell phone or VoIP, determining DSL availability might be difficult. Since DSL uses the same lines as landline phones, you&amp;rsquo;ll need a neighbor&amp;rsquo;s landline number (with their consent) to run a search and get an idea of potential services. To establish service, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to contact the cable company directly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Verizon FIOS, a fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) service, is becoming increasingly available, particularly in the New York metropolitan area. This service offers high-speed internet with download speeds up to 30 Mbps, along with phone and television services, all delivered through fiber optic cables.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Satellite internet is another option if you&amp;rsquo;re in a rural location or an area not served by DSL or Cable. Although it&amp;rsquo;s pricier than other residential choices and comes with equipment fees, it&amp;rsquo;s a viable alternative to dial-up. However, keep in mind that the latency (delay) inherent in satellite internet makes it unsuitable for VoIP; conversations might resemble walkie-talkie exchanges.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wireless broadband, offered by local providers with limited coverage areas, can be found through newspaper ads or the Yellow Pages. It can be a comparable alternative to cable broadband in terms of quality and cost, especially in smaller counties where cable internet might be limited.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Professional-grade telecom services, like T1, are common for businesses needing reliable connectivity. T1 offers consistent 1.5 Mbps upload and download speeds, often with service level agreements for guaranteed uptime. While significantly more expensive (around $400/month in major cities), it provides superior reliability, faster repair times, and potential managed router services. This level of service is generally chosen by individuals with demanding professions requiring top-tier connectivity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Business DSL, another option, is usually found in commercially zoned areas near telephone company offices. Offering symmetrical bandwidth (similar upload and download speeds) at higher costs than residential DSL, it shares the same distance limitations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other business-oriented bandwidth solutions, such as T3 or DS3 (45 Mbps) and fiber optic Ethernet (10 Mbps to 1 Gbps), are geared towards larger companies. Starting around $2,000 per month, they are rarely justifiable for home office use.&lt;/p>

In this instance, a Beogram 4002 exhibited inconsistent behavior when attempting to locate the record&amp;rsquo;s setdown point after pressing start. This pointed to a potential fault in the carriage position sensor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Initially, I suspected the IR LED, a common culprit in later models like this 5513 Type. I replaced the LED, adjusted the brightness, and achieved the desired 5V output at the photo sensor cathode. The unit seemed to function correctly, successfully finding the setdown point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the issue resurfaced. The voltage fluctuated, and the setdown point was no longer reliably detected. I replaced the brightness adjustment trimmer, suspecting oxidation, but the problem persisted. With other components ruled out, I began to consider the photocell, despite never having had to replace one before. Testing the photocell with a multimeter revealed intermittent responsiveness, confirming its failure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because this specific photocell functions as a photoresistor in the circuit, I opted to replace it with a standard photoresistor. This required modifying the photocell housing to securely accommodate the new component. After redesigning and 3D printing a new insert, I was able to install a standard GL5539 photoresistor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After experimenting with different photoresistor types, I found that the GL5539 provided consistent performance under various lighting conditions. It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that adjusting the LED intensity using R88 might be necessary to ensure reliable switching of TR17 based on the presence or absence of a black stripe in front of the sensor. Monitoring the collector voltage of TR17 with a voltmeter is recommended during this adjustment process.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>T1 PRI For Call Centers</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/t1-pri-for-call-centers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jun 2024 04:29:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/t1-pri-for-call-centers/</guid><description>&lt;p>When deciding on phone service for your call center, digital options are essential. While individual analog lines work for small setups, they lack integration capabilities and become costly as you expand beyond a few lines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For call centers with 10-12 lines using traditional PBX systems, digital T1 carrier service is a cost-effective solution. T1 lines offer two configuration options: channelized and PRI (Primary Rate Interface). Channelized T1 provides 24 independent lines suitable for various call types but lacks advanced features like Caller ID.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>PRI, on the other hand, utilizes 23 voice channels and one dedicated data channel, enabling faster call setup, Caller ID, and integration with Computer Telephone Integration (CTI) systems for enhanced customer data display. Multiple PRI lines can be combined for increased capacity, and using two data channels ensures redundancy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>VoIP (Voice over IP) systems offer another approach. By converting voice into digital data, VoIP leverages your existing Ethernet network for both phones and computers. Unchannelized T1 lines, or data T1 lines, are used for data transmission beyond your facility, offering 1.5 Mbps bandwidth and the ability to combine multiple lines for increased bandwidth through bonding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To determine the most suitable and cost-effective T1 service for your call center, consult with experts like Shop for T1. Their consultants can assess your specific requirements and provide competitive quotes. Requesting a T1 service quote is quick, easy, and free. Remember that T1 lines are intended for business use, not residential purposes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Rose Is On The Bloom</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-rose-is-on-the-bloom/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jun 2024 01:12:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-rose-is-on-the-bloom/</guid><description>&lt;p>Bloom Energy recently introduced its &amp;ldquo;Energy Server&amp;rdquo; fuel cell, presenting it as a significant step towards greener energy and energy independence. This begs the question: how impactful will this new technology actually be?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://www.T1Explainer.com/images/VoltMeterXLS.jpg"
loading="lazy"
alt="More clean and less expensive power is what we need."
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While it&amp;rsquo;s early to definitively say, Bloom Energy&amp;rsquo;s generators could become a vital part of energy production and management, or even revolutionize our relationship with energy entirely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Bloom Energy Server originated from a NASA project aimed at generating air and fuel from electricity for Mars expeditions. When the project concluded, Dr. KR Sridhar and his team realized the technology could be reversed to produce electricity using air and fuel. After five years, they had a working prototype, and within a few more, they scaled it to a commercial level of 100 KW. Now, the Energy Server is a viable product, implemented by major corporations like Google and Ebay.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, how does it work, and what makes it superior to other green energy solutions? The Bloom Energy Server is a high-temperature fuel cell that transforms hydrocarbon fuel and oxygen into water and electricity. This technology was first explored during the Apollo Moon program when NASA utilized fuel cells in their spacecraft. Bloom&amp;rsquo;s innovation lies in using a ceramic plate as a dielectric, coated with proprietary inks to facilitate chemical reactions. Each handheld plate can generate about 1 KW of electricity, and by stacking them in modules, power output can reach 10 KW for a home or 100 KW for a small business.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.bloomenergy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;img src="http://www.T1Explainer.com/images/BloomFuelCellLargeAnnotated350.jpg"
loading="lazy"
alt="Inside the Bloom Fuel Cell"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The fuel cell runs on natural gas directly from utility lines, landfill methane, or other available bio-gases, with oxygen sourced from the air. It produces heat and steam, essential for sustaining the reaction, and releases a small amount of CO2 as a byproduct – less than burning the gas directly. This process is cleaner and more efficient than using a gas turbine generator.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It can be compared to a quiet, solid-state gas turbine generator without exhaust, making it a suitable replacement for engine-based backup generators in homes and businesses. Currently, the cost is prohibitive for residential use. However, it offers a roughly three-year payback for businesses using it as an alternative energy source, not just backup power. This is impressive for a newly released product in limited production. As production scales up, prices are expected to decrease. Additionally, Bloom Energy Servers will be offered in a wider range of models with varying power levels.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even if this technology simply offered a new way to convert natural gas to electricity, it would still be significant. But it&amp;rsquo;s more than that. Being a clean, quiet device that can be installed next to a building with a similar size and appearance to a large electrical transformer, it allows for more distributed power generation. If the price becomes more accessible, with a one-year payoff or better, there might be a rush by medium and large businesses to install these systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We anticipated this to happen with solar panels, but cost and the fluctuating nature of solar power hindered widespread adoption. Google, a Bloom Energy Server user, has installed large solar panel arrays, but these remain uncommon in the U.S. Wind energy is more popular but also suffers from inconsistent output due to wind variability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Critics of green energy use these limitations to dismiss the idea of moving away from traditional hydrocarbon fuels. However, this perspective is too narrow. The solution isn&amp;rsquo;t a single breakthrough like fusion but a multi-faceted approach using various technologies managed by a smart grid that distributes energy efficiently. For example, solar power is ideal for peak air conditioning demands during summer midday hours when solar panels generate the most power.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A truly smart grid could even leverage millions of electric cars parked in garages to regulate grid stability by quickly supplying or absorbing small amounts of electricity. The Bloom Energy Server could serve a similar function on a commercial scale. Imagine companies having both a Bloom unit and solar panels on their premises. Our struggling energy grid would stabilize, potentially allowing us to decommission outdated coal-fired power plants.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course, we still need baseload power, which alternative sources can&amp;rsquo;t currently provide. This highlights the need for more nuclear plants to reduce carbon emissions. Bloom Energy Servers, in large numbers, could potentially contribute to baseload power. However, it&amp;rsquo;s unclear how much natural gas we&amp;rsquo;ll have if we replace coal with gas on a large scale. Additionally, converting fossil fuels to electricity inherently releases some CO2.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We don&amp;rsquo;t yet know how successful we can be if we fully commit to energy independence and green energy. We can&amp;rsquo;t claim to have truly tried until solar panels, windmills, and people selling excess electricity to the grid become commonplace. We reached the moon in under a decade using fuel cells. Imagine how quickly we could solve our energy challenges if we fully dedicated ourselves to wind, solar, and fuel cell technologies.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Remembering &amp;lsquo;76 and a Class About Dirt&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yesterday&amp;rsquo;s blog post about soil microbes reminded me of my college soil science class back in the fall of 1976. I was attending Sterling College, although at the time it was a far cry from the established institution it is today. Back then, it was a former prep school attempting to reinvent itself, offering a unique one-year program called The Grassroots Project in Vermont - a very &amp;rsquo;70s endeavor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve written about my time at Sterling before, but never about my experience in &amp;ldquo;Dirt Class,&amp;rdquo; which was the actual name of the course. Our instructor, who told us to call him &amp;ldquo;Tar,&amp;rdquo; is pictured in the photo above.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even though 1976 feels like ages ago, I distinctly recall the class being called &amp;ldquo;Dirt Class&amp;rdquo; and our teacher being named Tar. The photo clearly shows Tar holding a tetrahedron. I&amp;rsquo;m certain about these details because I wrote them on the back of the picture myself, back in 1976&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEipGw7BeurPZS4SYdyT_a1-lnyW8Cy5ovY-550FR5-RT_MVRbuoES5JkKv5hlLdbcHS98X8us7TcwkJrnR6saJftPSyeimoMbHQ6YDx7zm1v-kv-OZqMoqAuK3LenmEyLwexUmeFKMU5oM/s1600/Tar&amp;#43;Dirt&amp;#43;Class&amp;#43;760.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

loading="lazy"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[Is it true that cursive writing is no longer taught in schools? Can anyone confirm?]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tar was actually a University of Vermont professor who commuted to Sterling approximately once a week to teach our class of roughly 70 students.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the tetrahedron suggests, the class focused on dirt - an inert medium. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>To clarify, &lt;em>dirt&lt;/em> comprises sand, silt, clay, and organic matter. It should not be mistaken for &lt;em>soil&lt;/em>, which includes a rich diversity of living microorganisms like bacteria, fungi, protozoa, nematodes, and micro-arthropods alongside sand, silt, clay, and organic matter, as Elaine Ingam often emphasizes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Soil microorganisms can be either beneficial or harmful. Well-structured, aerated soils that haven&amp;rsquo;t been excessively tilled or subjected to synthetic chemicals promote beneficial microbial activity and, consequently, plant health.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Conversely, in poorly aerated, chemically-treated soils, harmful microorganisms thrive, creating an environment that hinders optimal plant growth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Had Tar imparted knowledge about the complex web of life within the soil, it&amp;rsquo;s something I would have remembered. However, that wasn&amp;rsquo;t the case, though it wasn&amp;rsquo;t his fault. The understanding of soil biology was quite limited in 1976.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Considering the advancements made in the past 41 years, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be surprising if our current understanding of soil seems elementary in another 41 years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Speaking of which, I&amp;rsquo;ll be celebrating my 100th birthday in 41 years (and everyone&amp;rsquo;s invited!).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I recall Tar as a good teacher who tried his best to make learning about dirt engaging. We never had any exams, only lectures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most memorable experience from Dirt Class was an exceptional autumn afternoon. As Tar was engrossed in explaining tetrahedrons, the sunlight streaming through the west windows of Simpson Hall turned a captivating shade of golden.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our attention drifted towards the window, and Tar, noticing this, paused his lecture. Some students got up to take a closer look. The sunset over the common was breathtaking. Recognizing the moment, Tar exclaimed, &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s all go outside and enjoy the sunset!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We all left Simpson Hall, crossed the road, and gathered on the common to admire the beauty of that place and that particular moment. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was truly special.&lt;/p>

Utilizing a file compression tool, 7-Zip, he was able to partially deconstruct these OLE files, hinting at a promising discovery. Hopefully, he will share his findings on whether he&amp;rsquo;s successfully deciphered the OLE file format.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Regarding GP Notes, my experience suggests limited consistent usage of the GP Note fields and even less utilization of the OLE Container feature for file attachments or embedding content. However, I believe a more accessible, open, or standardized file format could potentially increase adoption rates and open up intriguing integration opportunities for data sharing with external systems. This could even pave the way for automating document attachments, simplifying the process for users and bypassing the somewhat cumbersome OLE Container window.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Alternatively, many robust third-party document management modules for Dynamics GP offer impressive features for handling file attachments linked to GP transactions. For companies requiring extensive file integration with GP data, these solutions might be more suitable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For those invested in GP Notes and OLE attachments, Mariano&amp;rsquo;s follow-up post is definitely worth exploring.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Data can be moved in many ways. The new top choice is Fiber Optic Ethernet, known as EoF or Ethernet over Fiber, which offers excellent value.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.gigapackets.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

alt="Check prices and availability of Fiber Optic Ethernet service now."
>&lt;/a>&lt;strong>What is Fiber Optic Ethernet Transport?&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
When fiber optic lines were first installed, Ethernet wasn&amp;rsquo;t a factor. The standard was SONET (Synchronous Optical NETworking), designed to carry existing DS1 and DS3 phone calls on fiber. Fiber offered significantly more bandwidth than copper twisted pair, microwave, or coaxial cable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ethernet started in computer networking. Sending this data outside required protocol conversion for T-carrier and SONET fiber to carry data packets instead of phone calls. Eventually, carrying Ethernet directly was standardized, creating Ethernet over Copper and Ethernet over Fiber. Wireless options like WiFi and WiMAX emerged for shorter distances, using microwave, laser, and radio systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Immense Advantage of Fiber Optic Ethernet&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Carrier Ethernet, adopted by various providers, is directly compatible with computer networks, eliminating protocol conversion. Services like E-LAN can even connect multiple LANs into one large network.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ethernet is also easily scalable. Traditional MAN or WAN services offer fixed speeds (like T1 at 1.5 Mbps or DS3 at 45 Mbps), limiting data transmission and requiring upgrades for more bandwidth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fiber Ethernet has a nearly limitless ceiling. Each fiber strand can handle around 10 Gbps and be multiplied many times over. With hundreds of strands in a cable, capacity is rarely an issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Payment is based on the service level, such as 100 Mbps or 1 Gbps. Upgrading is often as simple as a phone call, with port capacity (often 1 Gbps to 100 Gbps) as the limit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Best Advantage of All&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Competition and fiber optics&amp;rsquo; capacity have driven prices per Mbps lower than ever, often surpassing SONET. These reliable circuits often have service guarantees, symmetrical upload/download speeds, and dedicated bandwidth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Competing Bandwidth Options&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Ethernet over Copper offers similar benefits for bandwidths of 10-25 Mbps. T1 lines are viable for lower speeds (1.5-3 Mbps).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Budget-friendly choices, mostly shared bandwidth for consumers, include business cable broadband, wireless internet, satellite, DSL, and cellular broadband. While Mbps prices are tempting, these often have asymmetrical speeds (download significantly faster than upload).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wireless options usually have usage limits, unsuitable for large downloads. Satellite, though widely available, has latency issues affecting real-time applications.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These services are almost exclusively internet access. In contrast, Fiber Ethernet offers dedicated internet access or private point-to-point lines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The best bandwidth service for your business depends on your needs. With more options and better pricing than you might expect, discover what &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.gigapackets.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>FlexTelONE bundles a calling card, conference calling, dial-around, and a follow-me locator service. Let&amp;rsquo;s explore the features and advantages of each service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The calling card allows calls from both the US and internationally, a key feature for international callers. Calls within the US cost just 5.9 cents per minute, while calls from Canada are 8.9 cents per minute. You can use the calling card in over 50 countries with significantly lower rates than typical hotel long distance services. After registering your phone for North American calls, the system automatically enters your 14-digit calling card PIN, making it almost as simple as dialing directly. The difference is a much lower per-minute cost for long distance and international calls.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The conference calling feature enables hosting calls with domestic and international participants without reservations. Available 24/7, it accommodates global time differences. Direct dial-in costs 4.9 cents per minute, while US toll-free access is 8.9 cents per minute (9.9 cents from Canada). The classic domestic bridge supports up to 16 lines for everyone to dial in, while the enhanced international conference allows up to 30 lines, enabling you to dial out and include international participants at rates based on their country.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>FlexTelOne also functions as a dial-around long-distance service from any phone, eliminating the need to switch providers. Simply dial the FlexTelONE access number before your international call and enjoy lower rates than your current provider. This service works from home or business landlines and cell phones.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The follow-me locator service provides a simple call forwarding solution for travelers. While callers must access the system from North America, you can be reached at any valid domestic or international number.&lt;/p>

Recovering from payroll errors becomes significantly less painful with a readily available backup.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beyond backups, two additional recommendations are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Avoid posting payroll if printing or processing issues arise. Instead, cancel the process. The transactions can be included in a new run, eliminating the need to address a partial posting.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>When using manual checks for adjustments or corrections, meticulous review of taxable wages and employer FICA taxes is critical. These fields, not detailed on the edit list, are frequent culprits in 941 and payroll summary reconciliation discrepancies.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Shifting gears to payroll mishaps, a recent case involved interrupted payroll printing due to an unexpected server shutdown. Upon restoring the server, posting attempts resulted in errors, but fortunately, printed checks were already available for distribution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The interruption seemingly occurred between updates to the check history (UPR30100) and transaction history (UPR30300) tables. While the check history contained the checks, the corresponding transaction history entries were absent. Removing the orphaned records from UPR30100 enabled re-entry of payroll data via manual checks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the 941 remained inaccurate, despite a correct Payroll Summary and wage amounts. The culprit was doubled taxes, both in the overall 941 and the Schedule B for that payroll date.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Further investigation in Utilities&amp;raquo;Payroll&amp;raquo;Edit Liabilities revealed that the check run data was present in the Payroll Tax Liabilities table (UPR30200). Removing the duplicate entry resolved the issue, highlighting the importance of this table, especially during posting interruptions where summary-level information seems to post before detailed data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Transitioning from advocating for backup restoration to resolving payroll issues firsthand has been an eye-opening experience. The choice between restoring from a backup and the potential time and complexity of manual cleanup remains debatable. Ensuring client comprehension of the cleanup process adds another layer of complexity. While the jury is still out, a preference for the &amp;ldquo;old-school&amp;rdquo; approach of relying on backups might be taking hold.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/a>One cloud solution often overlooked due to its existence before the cloud trend is GoToMyPC. Although not typically associated with the cloud, it embodies the concept.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>GoToMyPC enables remote login to your computer. But isn&amp;rsquo;t accessing your desktop from a restaurant, running office applications, conceptually similar to using a private cloud?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This way, you create a private cloud without needing Infrastructure or Software as a Service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>GoToMyPC allows access to your primary computing environment from anywhere. For small businesses, this is usually a Windows PC or a Mac. You can connect to it with various devices, including iPads, using a free app.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Functioning as a remote desktop, GoToMyPC replicates your base computer&amp;rsquo;s desktop on another device, allowing application use, data access, and file transfers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It works through downloadable software on the accessed PC, granting screen, keyboard, and mouse control remotely. Encrypted links ensure secure remote operation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since the system relies on the accessed computer, it needs to remain powered on. However, any cloud application requires its servers to be running. Technically, a GoToMyPC server relays encrypted data between devices, making it cloud-based.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The PC version offers more features than the Mac version, but both allow remote access to either operating system from various devices. GoToMyPC supports accessing up to 20 computers remotely. Professional or corporate versions cater to larger companies, accommodating more users and an administrator, even handling up to a thousand users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If this seems beneficial, a 30-day free trial is available. It&amp;rsquo;s an affordable tool that enhances existing computer capabilities. Start your &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1726600-4992719" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

However, many businesses are also transitioning their phone systems to the cloud. This shift brings both benefits and hurdles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The traditional phone network is essentially a large cloud network. This system is designed for reliability and high-quality service, handling countless users at once. Users connect to this cloud through a direct line to their nearest local central office, unconcerned with the complexities of the system. They simply want to make calls easily.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some businesses create their own private phone clouds using ISDN PRI lines to link multiple office PBXs. This avoids per-call charges, only paying for external calls.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A more contemporary approach involves merging voice and data networks across offices, streamlining management. MPLS networks, known for their reliability and cost-effectiveness, often underpin these systems. This is known as enterprise VoIP, where a central IP PBX or smaller, distributed systems handle calls. ISDN PRI lines connect to the public network for outside calls.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SIP Trunking presents an alternative to ISDN PRI lines for carrying voice traffic. Functioning as part of the VoIP system, a SIP trunk links to an outside provider. This provider manages connections to the public phone network, often at lower costs due to bulk call termination.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some businesses take it a step further, sourcing all phone services from the cloud. Using SIP phones or adapted analog phones on their network, they connect to a virtual PBX at the provider&amp;rsquo;s location via a private line or SIP trunk. This virtual PBX manages all call routing, both internal and external. This setup is perfect for companies without a physical office, allowing geographically dispersed teams to function as if they were together. Even the receptionist&amp;rsquo;s role is virtualized, routing calls based on voice prompts or keypad inputs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To see if cloud networking can benefit your business, consult with an expert on enterprise VoIP telephone services.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How Maestro Smart Antenna Improves Fixed Wireless</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/how-maestro-smart-antenna-improves-fixed-wireless/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 May 2024 14:04:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/how-maestro-smart-antenna-improves-fixed-wireless/</guid><description>&lt;p>Accel Technologies, a branch of Accel Networks, is launching a groundbreaking product for fixed wireless connections: the Maestro smart antenna system. Maestro aims to make 3G and 4G fixed wireless broadband a more attractive alternative to pricier business connectivity options like T1, MPLS, VSAT, Frame Relay, and point-to-point microwave services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.affordablevpn.com/usa/FixedWireless/fixed-wireless-broadband.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;img src="http://www.AffordableVPN.com/images/Tower100ANI.gif"
loading="lazy"
alt="New antenna makes fixed wireless services more available"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What makes Maestro so special? Like other smart devices, Maestro utilizes active technology to enhance performance. In this situation, it improves the performance of a typically passive component: the RF antenna. Antennas are essential for all electronic communication. They can be as basic as a foil trace on a circuit board or as complex as a multi-element Yagi beam antenna. Satellite dishes, long wires used with shortwave radios, and vertical tower arrays for directional AM radio broadcasts are all examples of antennas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The crucial thing about antennas is that they are the initial point of contact for incoming signals and the final component involved in outgoing signals. An antenna can be any arbitrary length of conductor or a precisely calibrated system. Most antenna designs are &amp;ldquo;cut&amp;rdquo; to a specific size that resonates with the frequencies in use. The correct antenna length significantly improves both transmission and reception. Tuning antennas can be achieved by adding other passive components, such as capacitors and inductors. Adding more elements or creating a parabolic reflector (like a satellite dish) increases the antenna&amp;rsquo;s gain, which acts like amplification, resulting in a stronger signal. However, as a passive device, there&amp;rsquo;s a trade-off: gain in one direction leads to reduced sensitivity in other directions. For most applications, this is beneficial, as a directional antenna minimizes interference from signals coming from other directions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Consider the antenna on your wireless router – it&amp;rsquo;s likely a small, black vertical stick. Its length is specifically chosen for the frequencies it uses, but it isn&amp;rsquo;t directional. This &amp;ldquo;whip&amp;rdquo; antenna transmits and receives equally well in all horizontal directions but not as well vertically. This design is suitable for blanketing an area with reception, such as a WiFi hotspot, as it provides broad coverage for users spread out or on the move.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, is a basic whip antenna sufficient for connecting to a fixed wireless service? It might be if the signal is very strong. But what if you&amp;rsquo;re just outside the range of optimal coverage? Smartphones and USB modem aircards are designed for mobility, so they must have universal coverage, even if it means compromising performance. However, with a fixed business location and fixed towers, using an antenna optimized for the transmission path is more efficient.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is where Maestro comes in. Its high-tech, patent-pending design incorporates eight antennas, three switchable filter banks, and an embedded Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) that adjusts to maintain the best carrier-to-noise ratio for the 3G or 4G service in use. Maestro boasts over 500 distinct setting options for fine-tuning performance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why such complexity? Accel Networks specializes in leveraging the widespread availability of cellular broadband service across the US and Canada. While we primarily associate cellular with mobile phone internet, it can also serve as fixed-location broadband. However, it sometimes struggles indoors because the small antennas on USB dongles and MiFi boxes can&amp;rsquo;t get a strong enough signal. Introducing a quality antenna before the transmitter/receiver results in a robust signal that won&amp;rsquo;t drop or slow down.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Maestro will launch roughly a month from now. Accel anticipates that its introduction for 3G and 4G fixed wireless broadband will challenge existing solutions businesses use for high-speed internet access, including rooftop VSAT satellite dishes, T1 lines, DSL, cable, frame relay, and even microwave fixed wireless systems. Many businesses, especially small retail stores and offices, don&amp;rsquo;t need massive bandwidth. They need basic connectivity for credit card processing, email, and website access. 3G or 4G cellular service can provide the necessary bandwidth, reliability, and latency at a significantly lower cost. Accel already has over 6,000 installations demonstrating this, and Maestro will bring these benefits to even more locations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If your business is in an area with limited or expensive broadband service, explore the availability and pricing of fixed wireless broadband. You might be surprised at its affordability and performance.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When running an eConnect 2010 or 2013 integration, you might encounter the following error message during the CreateTransactionEntity code call: &amp;ldquo;There was an error writing to the pipe: The pipe is being closed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This error, while encountered previously in testing, has reappeared during a GL JE integration on both a development server and client workstation. A temporary fix involves closing and relaunching the integration for successful import.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Microsoft offers a publicly accessible knowledge base (KB) article addressing this issue and its resolution: &lt;a class="link" href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2539263" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2539263&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While not a WCF specialist, it seems unusual for this error to arise, especially when code reinstantiates eConnect objects with each run. This practice should prevent explicitly holding onto idle eConnect instances. Additionally, the infrequent occurrence of this error across numerous integrations and clients suggests potential variability in how it manifests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The KB article outlines a simple, permanent solution. Add the &lt;strong>receiveTimeout=&amp;ldquo;infinite&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong> parameter to the eConnect service config file, located in:&lt;/p>

You might think it&amp;rsquo;s impossible, but it&amp;rsquo;s more achievable than you think.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You won&amp;rsquo;t need massive spools of wire or heavy equipment. Everything is taken care of, allowing you to focus on expanding your business and profits.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is possible due to two key advancements: the rise of Metro and Carrier Ethernet services from competitive carriers and a business model that lets you integrate these Ethernet WAN services into your network designs. This means you can earn recurring commissions based on your clients&amp;rsquo; bandwidth usage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Metro Ethernet provides WAN connectivity within a specific city, while Carrier Ethernet extends this connection across cities and even nationwide.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These services offer speeds comparable to wired LAN connections, including 10 Mbps Ethernet, 100 Mbps Fast Ethernet, and even 1000 Mbps Gigabit Ethernet. The cost per Mbps decreases as speeds increase, offering significant savings compared to traditional telco data services like DS3 or SONET.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ethernet services are currently available in major metropolitan areas, including downtown and suburban business districts. While higher speeds are accessible in buildings with fiber optic connectivity, standard and Fast Ethernet are often available over copper wire within a short distance of carrier Points of Presence (POPs), known as Ethernet over Copper (EoC).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Locating nearby fiber-lit buildings is simple using the GeoQuote (tm) Ethernet Mapping Tool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recommending these services to clients can be as easy as connecting them with providers. However, you can unlock greater profit potential by assessing your clients&amp;rsquo; needs and submitting quote requests through a special platform. This approach earns you credit for the sale and ongoing commissions for every service you help your client lease. Learn more and join the VAR Partner Network today.&lt;/p>

However, a new technology called Ethernet over Copper (EoC) offers even greater bandwidth at a lower cost and with simpler connectivity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>EoC, like T1, uses existing twisted-pair telephone wiring commonly found in business locations. Traditional T1 lines use two twisted pairs within this wiring, allowing for simultaneous two-way data transfer at 1.5 Mbps. While T1 prices have fallen to a few hundred dollars monthly, EoC provides comparable pricing with double the bandwidth at 3 Mbps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This difference stems from EoC&amp;rsquo;s more modern and efficient data transmission technology. T1, developed post-WWII, relies on a synchronized, channel-based system ideal for phone calls but less suited for today&amp;rsquo;s packet-based internet protocols. Ethernet, designed for packet-based transmission, avoids this incompatibility, leading to increased efficiency.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While T1 can achieve higher bandwidth by combining multiple lines (a process called bonding), EoC offers a greater advantage. T1 bonding is typically limited to 10-12 Mbps, while EoC can reach up to 100 Mbps over short distances, with 10-20 Mbps readily achievable. For speeds beyond 45-50 Mbps, fiber optic connections become the preferred choice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main limitation of EoC is its distance constraint, often referred to as a &amp;ldquo;Metro Ethernet&amp;rdquo; service. Its availability is generally confined to major metropolitan areas within a few miles of the central hub. In contrast, T1, designed with signal boosters for long-distance transmission, can be accessed virtually anywhere, though cost increases with distance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While fiber optic infrastructure expands, businesses don&amp;rsquo;t have to settle for limited bandwidth. By exploring available options and comparing prices for EoC and Bonded T1, businesses can determine the most suitable high-bandwidth solution for their needs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Onion Drying</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/onion-drying/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 May 2024 23:11:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/onion-drying/</guid><description>&lt;p>Dateline: 17 August 2016&lt;/p>

&lt;p>After harvesting onions, they require a curing period to prepare them for winter storage. This drying process, particularly for the necks, can last several weeks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During my childhood, our barn had large doors that opened to an upper drive floor and a smaller door on the opposite side. This allowed us to create a well-ventilated, covered space by opening all the doors. We would arrange the onions on old boards placed across chairs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently, I lack a barn or garage for onion curing. However, I have a makeshift woodshed beside my house with a roof and open sides, which suffices. In Upland, we make do with available resources. :-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The picture showcases my onions spread on boards, enjoying ample airflow. As the green tops dry, I will trim them approximately an inch above the bulb.

This raises the question: are businesses truly shifting from traditional data centers to cloud-based solutions? And if so, what motivates this transition and what are their objectives?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Unveiling the Hidden Potential of Cloud Technology&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cloud storage receives significant attention, but the vast server capacity offered by the cloud is equally compelling. One often overlooked application is Hosted PBX or Hosted VoIP, which replaces traditional phone systems. While you still use physical phones, they connect to your data network instead of dedicated phone lines, eliminating the need for on-site switching systems. This functionality is entirely managed in the cloud.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Advantages of Hosted PBX&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By opting for Hosted PBX, you eliminate the burdens of owning and maintaining an in-house system, including the constant need for moves, additions, and changes. Additionally, you only pay for the services you utilize. Phones can be added as required, with monthly charges for each active device. Downsizing or shifting business strategies? Easily remove phones as needed. Some providers even supply the phones, saving you additional expenses. It&amp;rsquo;s a remarkably advantageous solution.&lt;/p>

This leads IT departments to consider purchasing or leasing dark fiber for enhanced bandwidth, latency, and control. However, there&amp;rsquo;s another option worth exploring: managed wavelength services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.gigapackets.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;img src="http://www.gigapackets.com/images/PrismSpectrum250.jpg"
loading="lazy"
alt="See how managed wavelength services can give you the bandwidth and low laency you require&amp;hellip;"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In simple terms, a wavelength is a distinct color or lambda on a fiber optic strand. Fiber optic lines transmit multiple light beams simultaneously, with each color representing a unique wavelength or frequency of laser light. These different colors allow the light beams to coexist within the fiber without interference, similar to separate wire pairs in a copper bundle or channels in a cable system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Multiple wavelengths enhance efficiency. Transmitting and receiving multiple lambdas is much more cost-effective than laying thousands of miles of fiber optic cable. Each cable contains numerous strands, and each strand carries multiple wavelengths, resulting in a massive bandwidth capacity for commercial use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This technology is called Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM). The &amp;ldquo;dense&amp;rdquo; signifies that numerous wavelengths are closely spaced on the fiber. DWDM terminal equipment demands precise control over the light wavelengths, adhering to an International Telecommunications Union (ITU) standard for industry-wide compatibility. A single fiber strand can support up to 160 channels or wavelengths within the infrared C and L bands.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Companies with high bandwidth requirements can lease entire wavelengths from carriers who own fiber optic networks. Integra Telecom, for instance, offers wavelength services on their metropolitan and long-haul fiber optic network. A key advantage of wavelengths is protocol flexibility. Integra provides both traditional SONET Interface options at speeds of 2.5 Gbps and 10 Gbps, as well as Ethernet Interface options at 1 GigE and 10 GigE.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unlike dark fiber, where you manage all terminal equipment, or unmanaged wavelengths with limited carrier support, Integra&amp;rsquo;s managed wavelength services provide a comprehensive solution. This includes terminal equipment, 24/7 network monitoring, and alarm surveillance from their Network Operations Center (NOC).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The result is a highly dependable, high-bandwidth, low-latency point-to-point optical wavelength service suitable for both long-haul and metropolitan connections. Integra boasts a 5,000-mile high-speed long-haul network, metro services in major Western US cities, and connections to Chicago, New York City, Ashburn, VA, and Dallas. Their 3,000-mile metro access network spans 35 markets across 11 Western states, connecting over 1900 buildings with fiber. Businesses in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, Oregon, Utah, or Washington can all leverage Integra&amp;rsquo;s robust fiber optic network and wavelength services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wavelength services are particularly well-suited for businesses requiring robust business continuity and disaster recovery solutions, Ethernet transport, optical storage connectivity, or data storage connectivity. Organizations with multiple data centers often require the high capacity that wavelengths provide.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Every business, regardless of size, requires at least one telephone line. While phone lines may seem straightforward, you might have more choices than you realize. Are you confident that your business has the most suitable phone line?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.EnterpriseVoIP.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;img src="http://www.EnterpriseVoIP.com/images/BusinessPhone250.jpg"
loading="lazy"
alt="You have multiple options for business phone lines."
>&lt;/a>&lt;strong>Plain Old Telephone Service&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The traditional analog phone line, known as POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service), is a basic and familiar option.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>POTS lines are simple, consisting of a single twisted copper pair connecting a standard RJ-11 phone jack on your wall directly to the telephone company&amp;rsquo;s central office. A varying electrical current in the wires carries the phone conversation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that POTS functions as a self-contained phone system. Traditionally, phones used passive electrical components and drew power directly from the phone line. This feature ensures phone service even during power outages, as long as the phone itself doesn&amp;rsquo;t require external power.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, modern phones, even single-line models, often rely on electronic components and need AC power adapters or batteries. This is particularly true for cordless phone systems with multiple handsets. While you might still have a dial tone during a power outage, you&amp;rsquo;ll need a backup battery for the phone to function.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Multiple Lines&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;re not limited to a single POTS line; you can have as many as you need. Keep in mind that there&amp;rsquo;s no cost advantage to having multiple lines. Each line has a fixed price, whether you use one phone per line or share external lines using a Key Telephone System or PBX.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Wireless as an Option&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cellular phone service offers the possibility of eliminating landlines entirely. With cell towers replacing wires, wireless communication can be a practical solution for independent professionals who are frequently out of the office. A data plan allows for internet and voice telephony on the same device. You can enhance your mobile setup with features like a toll-free number, fax capability, and international calling. Shared plans can accommodate small offices as well. However, larger operations will likely still require wired landlines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Moving up to Trunks&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A telephone trunk consists of multiple phone lines combined into a single cable. While analog trunks existed in the past, digital technology has become the standard. The most prevalent types of trunks are T1, ISDN PRI, and SIP.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>T1 lines were developed to replace multiple analog POTS lines. Instead of separate wires, T1 lines utilize multiplexing to divide the available bandwidth into 24 independent channels, each functioning like a separate phone line.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have numerous phones and want to replace individual lines with a single T1 line, you might achieve the same or better service at a lower cost. A &amp;ldquo;channel bank&amp;rdquo; converts signals between T1 channels and analog lines, allowing you to connect your phones as usual.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>T1 vs ISDN PRI&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ISDN PRI (Primary Rate Interface) is a variation of the T1 line that employs the same channelization method but reserves one channel for dialing and switching for the remaining channels. This means you have a maximum of 23 available outside lines on a PRI trunk. However, ISDN PRI offers faster call switching, which is advantageous for call centers and businesses requiring highly efficient phone operations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most modern PBX systems have integrated interface circuitry for both T1 and ISDN PRI. You connect the trunk line, and the system manages the necessary conversions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>SIP Trunks&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many companies are transitioning to or considering VoIP technology. SIP trunks are a natural fit for VoIP phone systems because they use the same protocol (SIP). VoIP or SIP phones connect directly to an Ethernet LAN, often shared with computers, printers, and other network devices. The SIP trunk extends this network to connect to the VoIP service provider.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Similar to T1 and ISDN PRI, SIP trunks support multiple simultaneous conversations. However, these conversations utilize packet streams combined on a single line instead of separate channels.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An additional benefit of SIP trunks is their ability to carry both internet data and phone calls using packet format. Prioritizing voice traffic over data traffic within the trunk, known as Class of Service or Quality of Service, ensures optimal voice quality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To determine the most suitable phone line for your business, a quick approach is to obtain competitive quotes for various options, from POTS to SIP trunking.&lt;/p>

Although I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered numerous articles comparing NetSuite and Dynamics GP, they often seem biased. My goal is to provide a more impartial comparison based on my nine years of experience with Dynamics GP.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rather than engaging in the typical debates surrounding on-premise versus SaaS or licensed versus subscription models, this series will focus on comparing specific features and approaches within both systems. The objective is not to determine a winner but to highlight the pros and cons of each system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This exploration is driven by my desire to learn. While I possess extensive knowledge of Dynamics GP, I aim to understand NetSuite&amp;rsquo;s workings and identify key similarities and differences. By familiarizing myself with a new system, I hope to gain fresh insights into Dynamics GP as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My recent NetSuite project involved using SuiteScript for transaction customization. This experience forced me to learn NetSuite and SuiteScript rapidly, prompting a deeper comparison between the two systems. This series will delve into various aspects, including transaction saving mechanisms and customization language differences. I may also touch upon licensing and pricing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I welcome suggestions from the Dynamics GP community regarding specific areas of interest. For instance, understanding how GL account structures differ or how NetSuite handles complex accounting processes that are challenging in GP would be insightful.

&lt;p>The initial focus is on the main PCB. It was in its original state, showing signs of age and use. A detailed view highlights the RPM control section, which was particularly important for speed stability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All electrolytic capacitors on the board were replaced with new, high-quality Japanese components rated for 105 degrees Celsius. Additionally, a new relay and a set of 25-turn, encapsulated trimmers for RPM adjustment were installed. For comparison, the old and new versions of the relay and trimmers were shown side-by-side. These upgraded components are offered to other enthusiasts interested in restoring their own Beogram turntables.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The rebuilt board, alongside the extracted components, demonstrates the extent of the refurbishment. It’s important to note that the trimmers were positioned so that their adjustment screws extended through the PCB. This allows for RPM adjustments while the board is installed, and the platter is rotating.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, the output PCB, which houses the output grounding relay, was rebuilt. The delay capacitor and the relay were replaced, and a switch was added to connect the system and signal grounds. This feature is beneficial when using an RCA adapter with the turntable, as it can help eliminate humming that sometimes occurs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, a new reservoir capacitor was installed. This Beogram 4002 had a dual-capacitance type, no longer available, featuring a 4000uF section and a 1000uF section. The 1000uF section is utilized only when a CD-4 board is present, which is uncommon. The 4000uF section is crucial for the Beogram’s operation. To replace this discontinued component, a two-capacitor assembly was used with a 3D-printed adapter designed to fit the original capacitor&amp;rsquo;s mounting bracket. A 20k resistor was added across the 1000uF capacitor to discharge it when the turntable is unplugged for maintenance or transportation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next phase of the restoration project will involve rebuilding the RPM trimmer panel and upgrading the scale illumination from traditional light bulbs to LED assemblies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How Fiber Optic Metro Ethernet Works</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/how-fiber-optic-metro-ethernet-works/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2024 16:53:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/how-fiber-optic-metro-ethernet-works/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>By: John Shepler&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Are you spending too much on connecting your different business locations? Do you desire scalable bandwidth with reliable, dedicated speed, minimal lag, and uninterrupted data flow? You might be overlooking a crucial network solution. Let&amp;rsquo;s explore how &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8-URSjN4oo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>fiber optic Metro Ethernet connections&lt;/a> can benefit your business:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having a single provider manage both the core network and the connections to each location offers significant cost savings. Leading Metro Ethernet providers can leverage their infrastructure to save you money compared to leasing from local phone companies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Furthermore, Metro Ethernet provides services not available with traditional SONET/SDH connections. One of the most valuable is Ethernet LAN service. This standardized Carrier Ethernet service creates a fully connected layer 2 bridge LAN, unifying the internal networks at each location. As a result, employees experience a seamless network connection regardless of their location.&lt;/p>

The solution? A high-fiber diet for their network.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fiber optic cables are incredibly efficient. A single strand can handle massive amounts of voice, data, and video simultaneously, far exceeding the needs of most businesses. This capacity can be further multiplied by splitting the light into different wavelengths, each carrying gigabits per second. A fiber optic connection essentially unlocks almost limitless bandwidth potential for your business.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While fiber optic communication was once prohibitively expensive, competition has significantly driven down prices. Unlike the past, where local phone companies held a monopoly, numerous providers now offer fiber optic services. Many possess their own fiber optic core networks and access networks using both fiber and copper.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using copper, multiple twisted-pair wiring can deliver Ethernet speeds up to 45 Mbps by connecting to nearby carrier hubs. Fiber optic access is also a viable option for most city-based businesses, especially where usage justifies the installation cost. It&amp;rsquo;s becoming standard for office buildings and industrial parks to include fiber optic service as a basic utility during construction, allowing tenants to easily adjust their service level based on their needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What services can you get with fiber optic connections? A basic option is DS3, a digital service also used on T3 lines, offering 45 Mbps. However, DS3 uses just a fraction of a single fiber strand&amp;rsquo;s capacity. This means multiple customers can have their DS3 connections bundled on the same fiber optic line.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SONET, or Synchronous Optical NETwork, is the standard fiber optic service. Common SONET options include OC3 (155 Mbps), OC12 (622 Mbps), OC-48 (2.5 Gbps), and OC-192 (10 Gbps). While other levels exist, they are less widely available.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many newer providers have built their networks on IP technology instead of the traditional telco standard, SONET. They offer Ethernet as a WAN service with various speed options, including 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps (Fast Ethernet), and 1000 Mbps (Gigabit Ethernet or GigE). Getting 10 Gbps Ethernet is feasible and surprisingly affordable if your business demands it, especially when time-to-market and productivity are crucial.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The cost of fiber optic services has become much more manageable. It&amp;rsquo;s common to find 100 Mbps Ethernet for a fraction of its past cost. If you require more bandwidth or haven&amp;rsquo;t explored pricing recently, get updated quotes before assuming it&amp;rsquo;s out of reach. You might be pleasantly surprised.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>My wife Marlene and I recently got back from a two-day trip to Buffalo, New York, to meet up with some high school friends – Peggy, her husband Dick, and Ann. Peggy and Dick live in the Buffalo area and offered to take us sightseeing. Our main goal was to visit the Roycrofter Campus in East Aurora.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This picture shows the three women (I’ll always think of them as girls!) in the back seat of Dick’s car on Saturday morning. Marlene is on the left, then Ann, and then Peggy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our first stop was &lt;a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/9bX-yvWIGFU" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Our Lady of Victory Basilica&lt;/a> in Lackawana. Here’s a photo from the parking lot…&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This church is incredibly impressive architecturally – about as close as I’ll get to the Vatican. This is especially true considering Marlene and I attend a church in a renovated barn! Here’s an interior view…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEihdx4LJQhuIgY1F1pCSp5RHtrwS4cOWC5dw4ZyC2UdShBMhbhLwbAOEDc3ZBt7lGrjpigCy-buKFNdbhyphenhyphenQSh1vlFBHZjWxR8JhKovnG_k4e1BOifMXT2NjjMn_BHJVCQO4jQeLF67u19U/s1600/IMG_1736.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Basilica is enormous, and I remarked to Dick that it must be very expensive to heat. He informed me the church has its own natural gas well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From the Basilica, we drove along Lake Erie on our way to &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.forest-lawn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Forest Lawn Cemetery&lt;/a>, a popular tourist destination.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We were there to visit the grave of &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millard_Fillmore" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Millard Fillmore&lt;/a>, the 13th US president. Fillmore was born in Moravia, New York – or technically nearby Summerhill, which is now essentially part of Moravia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Marlene, Ann, Peggy, and I are all graduates of Moravia High School (class of 1976), and our social studies teacher was Bob Scarry, a Millard Fillmore expert who even wrote a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0786443405/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0786443405&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=whizbook-20&amp;amp;linkId=ee906647ac4a45bfc984a85e7094dd9e" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>We had a great time discussing history and trivia. At one point, Dick shared a piece of trivia I had never heard – Buddy Ebsen (Jed Clampett on &lt;em>The Beverly Hillbillies&lt;/em>) was originally cast as the Tin Man in &lt;em>The Wizard of Oz&lt;/em>, but he had an allergic reaction to the makeup. Here’s a picture of me and Dick from around that time…&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As we walked back to the car, I told Marlene about what our classmate Ty St. John (who owns a memorial company) had told me at our reunion. He suggested taking pictures of headstones we like, which I thought was a great idea! Here’s one I really liked…&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Later, we were all trying to remember all four members of The Monkees. We could only come up with Peter Tork, Davy Jones, and Michael Nesmith (whose mother invented Liquid Paper). Finally, Ann remembered the fourth Monkee - Mickey Dolenz, of course!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We had a 2:30 tour scheduled at the Roycroft campus, which gave us time for lunch at a coffee shop called &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.tasteofea.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Taste&lt;/a>. I enjoyed a “Millard ‘Fill-Me-More’” wrap and a pumpkin spice latte.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During lunch, we discussed &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_H._Green" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>General Green&lt;/a>, who lived in Moravia. Ann remembered him as a neighbor, and I knew about him from stories I had heard – including some from my mother, who helped care for his widow. Here’s a picture of General Green in his younger days…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh9kECADfl6eqmsKAi96nNy4HHQqM9rymqjGDeO2hmYFY8LX4MO6SAqbTMLQOLg49Igc1SPWYyhoXsJLigN-UOwXCG1B75jYqxsT6SxsZ5Zq_qSclswItXzSHgrqtlGUGtHi1oaCzdlR5Y/s1600/Thomas-H-Green.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>General Green was at Pearl Harbor and even had an old car with bullet holes from the attack, which he would drive in parades. He was also involved in governing Hawaii while it was under martial law during the war.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After lunch, we visited &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.vidlers5and10.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Vidler’s 5 &amp;amp; 10 Store&lt;/a>, an old-fashioned variety store. Marlene found a toy sheriff’s badge for our grandson, which we thought Dick might be able to use if he got pulled over!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We also drove past &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.aurorahistoricalsociety.com/pages/millard-fillmore-presidential-site" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Millard Fillmore&amp;rsquo;s house in East Aurora&lt;/a>, but we didn’t have time to stop. Fillmore was born in a log cabin, and a replica of it was built in Moravia with help from Bob Scarry. Here’s a picture of it…&lt;/p>

I prefer working on the same type of audio equipment consecutively because it minimizes workbench setup time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The owner followed our packing advice and packaged the turntable very well, using double boxes and protective foam. The turntable arrived without damage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Upon opening, I noticed the metal tonearm lid wouldn&amp;rsquo;t stay up. The part that connects to the hinge with damping grease was detached, a problem I haven&amp;rsquo;t encountered before. The lid&amp;rsquo;s attachment to the hinge plate also appeared to be the original, surprisingly intact double-sided tape.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An initial electrical check showed the Beogram powered on and the platter turned when prompted. However, the tonearm wouldn&amp;rsquo;t move forward or backward during playback, and the Stop button didn&amp;rsquo;t return the arm. These are common issues I&amp;rsquo;ll address during restoration. I managed to return the arm to its resting position by tricking the sensor with a platter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The tonearm compartment&amp;rsquo;s deck lid had deteriorated double-sided tape that will need replacing. The dustcover&amp;rsquo;s opening mechanism functioned correctly, but the back panel hinge assembly, although secure, raised concerns about potential damage during disassembly. To avoid this, I removed the dustcover and tonearm compartment lid by detaching the hinge bar. Interestingly, glue residue suggests prior repairs in this area.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I removed the transformer assembly and found a spider, a common occurrence in Bang &amp;amp; Olufsens! I proceeded to disassemble the Beogram into its service position for a complete assessment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The internal components looked good, mostly original with only one capacitor appearing replaced. The usual areas, like the microcomputer box&amp;rsquo;s thermal grease, will be refreshed during restoration. The transformer compartment was fine, but the platter motor drive capacitor will be replaced, as will the two capacitors on the floating chassis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I plan to check the scanning sensors and install a test connector for adjustments. The phono output board appeared fine, but I&amp;rsquo;ll replace the muting relay. The servo motor pulley was cracked and needs replacing. The tonearm wasn&amp;rsquo;t horizontally aligned – a problem for the service manual adjustments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The subplatter (rotor) was unexpectedly glued to the hub with epoxy and required careful separation. I&amp;rsquo;ll use a removable adhesive when reassembling. The aluminum deck around the platter, while secure, was attached with a makeshift foam tape. I plan to replace it with VHB tape for a cleaner look.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, this Beogram 8002 is in good condition. The electronic issues are typical and should be resolved by replacing capacitors, reflowing solder joints, and performing standard adjustments.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Shut Up That Screaming Cell Phone!</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/shut-up-that-screaming-cell-phone-/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 May 2024 20:42:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/shut-up-that-screaming-cell-phone-/</guid><description>&lt;p>A British company has developed a novel solution to combat the rising tide of cell phone theft: transforming stolen phones into sonic deterrents. The company, Synchronica, has introduced &amp;ldquo;wailing phones&amp;rdquo; that emit an earsplitting shriek when activated remotely. This piercing sound is designed to be so unsettling that it would make even the most hardened criminal think twice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Synchronica&amp;rsquo;s system works in conjunction with their Mobile Manager service, which allows companies to remotely control their employees&amp;rsquo; phones. If a device is stolen, authorized personnel can instantly lock it, erase all personal data, and activate the high-pitched alarm. This renders the stolen phone useless and forces the thief to discard it quickly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beyond the deterrent effect of the alarm, the system ensures data security. The moment the alarm is activated, any sensitive information stored on the phone is automatically deleted, preventing unauthorized access to contacts, emails, or private files.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The effectiveness of the screaming phone lies in its ability to attract immediate attention. A person holding a blaring phone becomes instantly conspicuous, making it difficult to blend in or profit from the stolen device. The sheer annoyance factor is enough to make anyone want to get rid of the phone as quickly as possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The article suggests that this technology could be applied to other security systems, such as car alarms. Imagine a world where car alarms, instead of emitting a monotonous beep, unleash a bloodcurdling scream. The author believes this would be far more effective in deterring theft and attracting attention.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The good news is that while Synchronica is based in the UK, they have a presence in the United States. This innovative security solution could soon be available to help protect against theft in the U.S.&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s common for users to accidentally delete or modify their budgets, so it&amp;rsquo;s important to review some guidelines for using budget windows in Microsoft Dynamics GP.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the Budget Maintenance window, accessed through Cards&amp;raquo;Financial&amp;raquo;Budget, then choosing either Open&amp;raquo;Using Microsoft Dynamics GP or New&amp;raquo;Using Microsoft Dynamics GP.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s crucial to remember that this window modifies the ENTIRE BUDGET unless a specific range is selected using the Ranges button. For example, clicking the Delete button removes the ENTIRE BUDGET. Similarly, using the Methods button to apply a 10% increase affects the ENTIRE BUDGET. This often surprises users who might manually adjust individual accounts within the window. However, buttons like Delete and Methods impact the entire budget unless a range restriction is in place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To prevent mishaps, enable the Preliminary button BEFORE making any changes. This allows you to close the window and discard modifications if needed. Note that the discard option is unavailable if &amp;ldquo;actual&amp;rdquo; is marked; you can only Save or Delete. Remember, Delete impacts the ENTIRE BUDGET unless a range is specified using the Ranges button.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While this might sound intimidating, modifying budgets in Microsoft Dynamics GP doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be frightening. Here are some helpful tips:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>To change a single account, use the Single Account Budget Maintenance window, found at Cards&amp;raquo;Financial&amp;raquo;Account&amp;raquo;Budget button. This window only affects the selected account&amp;rsquo;s budget and allows percentage-based adjustments.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>After modifying your budget, create a backup by exporting it to Excel via Cards&amp;raquo;Financial&amp;raquo;Budget. This ensures easy recovery if any issues occur.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Feel free to share any budgeting tips and tricks you&amp;rsquo;ve learned while using Microsoft Dynamics GP. The upcoming GP2010 release will introduce exciting features, including the ability to enter transactions directly into a budget and combine multiple budgets. Until then, happy budgeting!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A delightful surprise from Holland, Massachusetts.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-delightful-surprise-from-holland-massachusetts/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 May 2024 08:04:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-delightful-surprise-from-holland-massachusetts/</guid><description>&lt;p>Dated: September 4, 2016&lt;/p>

>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Five years ago, I laid my mother and stepfather to rest in Holland, Massachusetts. I&amp;rsquo;ve previously written about the experience, including a tribute to my stepfather.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pastor Bruce Plumley of the Holland Church officiated the service. We had never met before that day, and our interaction was brief. However, we did correspond through email, and I sent him a copy of my book, &lt;em>Writings of a Deliberate Agrarian&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Therefore, I was surprised a couple of weeks ago to receive an unexpected email from Pastor Plumley (shared here with his consent).&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Good morning Herrick,&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I know it has been many years and you may not remember me as vividly as I remember you.  I am the pastor at Holland Church in Holland Ma that conducted a graveside service for your family.  That day that we met, God blessed me with a treasure in you and your family that you will not realize this side of heaven.  This morning I had to let you know that your ministry has encouraged a weary pastor this day, and has caused me to fall on my knees and give our mighty God all glory and honor for His hand upon His people.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I have a copy of your book &lt;em>Writings of a Deliberate Agrarian&lt;/em>.  I had this little book made into a hard copy so that it will last longer and it is beautifully well preserved.  I did this because of the blessing and value to me and I pray to many others as the years go by.  I do share this book and others have been likewise blessed.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Yesterday I was so overwhelmed with the battle against the enemy as I ministered to God&amp;rsquo;s people, that I pulled out your book and began to read yet again of &amp;ldquo;The Good Life&amp;rdquo;.  Now do not get me wrong this does not take the place of God&amp;rsquo;s Word, but this little book is solace to me and reminds me that life is good and can be better.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Thank you for sowing into my life with your wisdom and passions as God has gifted you.  I am a blessed man.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>May God bless you abundantly in return,&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Pastor Bruce Plumley&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>My biggest accomplishment in life is writing a book about building a Whizbang chicken plucker. I wrote it to make money, and it was successful enough to allow me to self-publish a book without profit as the goal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Writings of a Deliberate Agrarian&lt;/em> is a book I felt compelled to write, almost like a calling. Since its publication ten years ago, I&amp;rsquo;ve received a few letters similar to Pastor Plumley&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Such feedback is incredibly meaningful to me. Receiving a hundred positive comments from readers of my chicken plucker book doesn&amp;rsquo;t compare to the feeling of fulfillment I receive from one letter like his.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s fascinating to see how this book, and its deeper message, has resonated with some while leaving others indifferent. This is probably true for any book, but I&amp;rsquo;m more aware of it with this one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, a few weeks ago, an older couple visited our church. When I introduced myself, the woman&amp;rsquo;s first response was, &amp;ldquo;I read your book.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I suspected she was referring to &lt;em>Writings of a Deliberate Agrarian&lt;/em>, but I was still taken aback. &amp;ldquo;How did you come across my book?&amp;rdquo; I asked.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I found it at the thrift store,&amp;rdquo; she replied.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It turned out she worked at the local thrift store run by the Methodist Church. Someone I likely gifted the book to had donated it. It held little value for them, but remarkably, it was discovered and cherished by someone who did.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s an old William Cowper quote:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;God moves in mysterious ways, His wonders to perform.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I witness this repeatedly in my life. The stories surrounding this book are just one example.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>A Final Thought&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Being a church pastor has to be one of the most challenging jobs imaginable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pastors face many disheartening realities, including worldly and apathetic churchgoers, a lack of love and biblical understanding, and a disregard for personal responsibility and striving for holiness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have immense respect and admiration for those who answer the call to pastor a church.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Get Your Employer to Pay For Your Broadband</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/get-your-employer-to-pay-for-your-broadband/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 May 2024 05:55:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/get-your-employer-to-pay-for-your-broadband/</guid><description>&lt;p>Companies may hesitate to increase employee benefits, but they become more receptive when these benefits also help their bottom line. Benefits that boost productivity and cut costs, such as providing free home broadband internet service, are more appealing to employers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although it sounds unbelievable, providing home broadband is a benefit some employers, including the U.S. government, are starting to offer. A news report revealed that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, with permission from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, can reimburse eligible employees for up to 100% of their home internet costs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The catch is that this benefit is contingent on employees telecommuting from home up to four days a week and utilizing the internet for work purposes. Productivity will be monitored to ensure employees are genuinely working. Additionally, employees accepting this benefit must relinquish their office space at the Patent Office headquarters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This arrangement benefits the company by freeing up valuable office space for other employees. While this opportunity might not appeal to executives, it could be highly advantageous for employees working in crowded office spaces. The company also benefits from broader organizational and societal advantages, such as reduced traffic congestion and pollution, as well as improved employee recruitment and retention due to the flexibility of working from home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Employees also reap significant benefits from this arrangement, including cost savings on commuting, professional attire, meals, and potentially childcare. Plus, they enjoy the perk of free home broadband internet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Telecommuting has long been a mutually beneficial arrangement for both employers and employees, especially in tech-savvy regions like Silicon Valley. Many companies nationwide have adopted flexible work arrangements, recognizing that allowing employees to work from home can be more cost-effective than investing in additional office space. With the government endorsing telecommuting, it might become a national strategy to tackle global warming and reduce reliance on foreign oil, all thanks to the small price of providing home broadband.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While this might seem like a minor perk, it&amp;rsquo;s a smart move by the government. Suburban commuting wastes significant time and energy and necessitates costly investments in expanding roadways to accommodate rush hour traffic. By setting a precedent for reimbursing home office broadband as a legitimate business expense, the government paves the way for companies to follow suit. Corporate savings on real estate, energy, office furniture, and supplies can easily outweigh the cost of providing internet service, especially given its declining price. Offering employees home broadband and perhaps even a company computer and software seems like a reasonable investment for companies, considering the potential cost savings they stand to gain.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Uh-Oh: Account Level Security and Advanced Search</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/uh-oh-account-level-security-and-advanced-search/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 May 2024 00:05:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/uh-oh-account-level-security-and-advanced-search/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m continually surprised that even with a decade of training experience, Dynamics GP users still uncover unexpected features. Just recently, during a class, a situation arose concerning account level security and the advanced search within the account lookup window.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For those unfamiliar with account level security, sometimes called organizational structures, this Dynamics GP feature allows you to organize users and general ledger accounts according to your company&amp;rsquo;s structure. This limits which accounts each user can access. Companies use this for several reasons:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Preventing users from posting to the wrong accounts&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Protecting sensitive account information from unauthorized viewing&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Presenting a simplified interface showing only relevant accounts to each user&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s imagine a scenario where account level security is set up to display a limited list of accounts for payables clerks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgDojDiNGZ8h8PP5uLyQh1N8yl2TwFrERk4RF9knWCDBiqLTgmjkcuEczhHXpn4L2OqscYU77SxzN0mQRXeMfA12nYonc_vbePMjE9BH-M3hjUvQG6zThmvGp7P1UHhfdE_I4eEnI55umzR/s1600/Accounts&amp;#43;Restricted.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgDojDiNGZ8h8PP5uLyQh1N8yl2TwFrERk4RF9knWCDBiqLTgmjkcuEczhHXpn4L2OqscYU77SxzN0mQRXeMfA12nYonc_vbePMjE9BH-M3hjUvQG6zThmvGp7P1UHhfdE_I4eEnI55umzR/s400/Accounts&amp;#43;Restricted.jpg"
loading="lazy"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When they use the Accounts lookup, the first account shown is 000-6170-04. This is the first account in their restricted list, not the entire chart of accounts. This functions as intended, ensuring payables clerks only see their designated expense accounts. However, a question arises: what happens when a user utilizes the Advanced Search function?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEikEr7jekMos_voW56MQpvukqMIR5Sr4tR24Gw7ZM07FTXGlk2YhVwP2HePhZyHea92X4bAhRxpJ-d8kgiE44buqydIEAbMH27rUcqErUML1GS5it34GCfyY24jWmC-LRuxxxNfjGinrf96/s1600/Accounts&amp;#43;Advanced&amp;#43;Search.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEikEr7jekMos_voW56MQpvukqMIR5Sr4tR24Gw7ZM07FTXGlk2YhVwP2HePhZyHea92X4bAhRxpJ-d8kgiE44buqydIEAbMH27rUcqErUML1GS5it34GCfyY24jWmC-LRuxxxNfjGinrf96/s400/Accounts&amp;#43;Advanced&amp;#43;Search.jpg"
loading="lazy"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this example, using the Advanced Search (the binoculars icon) and searching for Account Numbers starting with &amp;ldquo;000-1&amp;rdquo; yields a list. Surprisingly, this list includes accounts that fit the criteria but fall outside the restricted access granted by account security. Attempting to select one of these accounts results in an error:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj6O3BFCVaxqMoLl_ZNGmWGqGclZoCUbe1_rMM9IJyuPGXkQHdUrGNSkAoIz61vhCAt4SlxBRpvwfwC6HBSxra49nAo0Ay5I-eJLsfTtj91dPlBN51-xcqh67UjaYRX31IaP1Gh4SF07lAJ/s1600/Account&amp;#43;error.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

loading="lazy"
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While you can see these accounts, you cannot use them without proper access. This presents a minor issue: although the list is secure for posting and reporting, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t prevent viewing account descriptions. These descriptions might contain sensitive data, like names, that some might assume are hidden from restricted users. However, this is not the case, so it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to plan accordingly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A problem report exists for this issue, though it&amp;rsquo;s older and hasn&amp;rsquo;t gained much traction. Contact your Partner or Microsoft Support if you encounter this problem and want to be added to the list of affected customers. The report details are as follows:&lt;/p>

Here&amp;rsquo;s the situation:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We had a deduction set up initially as non-tax-sheltered. Later, this was changed to be tax-sheltered with specific tax boxes checked. While the general setup reflected this change, the existing deduction records for employees did not automatically update to reflect the new tax-sheltered status.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Typically, this wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a major problem as new employees would have the updated settings. However, the FUTA and SUTA reports were calculating wages incorrectly. These reports were configured to exclude tax-sheltered deductions, and in this case, the deductions shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been excluded. Adjusting the FUTA and SUTA settings to include these deductions resolved the issue for employees without tax-sheltered flags but created a new problem for those who did.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After investigation, we found the culprit to be the TXSHANTY field in the UPR00500 table. This field, a boolean value, was set to 1 (meaning some tax-sheltered boxes were checked) even when all individual tax-sheltered checkboxes were actually unchecked. This discrepancy arose from a system quirk: while the system wouldn&amp;rsquo;t update the individual checkboxes due to existing activity, it was still updating the TXSHANTY field in the background. This essentially created an impossible situation where the main control flag indicated a tax-sheltered status even though no individual tax-sheltered options were selected.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To resolve this, we used SQL scripts to identify and correct the affected records by resetting the TXSHANTY field to 0 where it was erroneously set to 1. Following this correction, FUTA and SUTA calculations worked as expected based on the defined settings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Interestingly, we also observed that the system seemed to be resetting the TXSHANTY field to 0 over time, although we couldn&amp;rsquo;t pinpoint the cause.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While Microsoft is in the process of documenting this as a bug, I wanted to share this experience in case others encounter a similar issue.&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s worth understanding this technology and its potential benefits.&lt;/p>

>http://www.copperethernet.com/&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>TDM, or Time Division Multiplexing, forms the foundation of T1 lines and SONET fiber optic services. It became the standard for the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) during its transition from analog to digital in the mid-20th century and remains relevant due to its continued prevalence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>TDM enables the transmission of multiple signals over a single digital line or wireless channel by dividing the transmission into timeslots. Each timeslot carries digitized information for one signal, and these timeslots are grouped into a frame containing all the digital bits. This frame is sent from the source to the destination, followed by another frame, creating a continuous flow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Imagine TDM as a round-robin process. Information chunks are collected from each source in turn. Once all sources are accounted for, the process restarts from the first source, ensuring a continuous stream of fresh data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>TDM allowed phone companies to combine 24 individual phone calls onto a single T1 line instead of requiring 24 separate wires. This multiplexing combines calls into a single bitstream transmitted over copper wires. At the receiving end, a demultiplexing process separates the calls for individual phones.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In contrast to TDM, Ethernet packages data into packets transmitted individually when ready. Instead of assembling packets into a multiplexed sequence, each packet is switched and routed independently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While TDM circuits (like T1 lines) and packet-switched circuits (like Ethernet over Copper) are distinct technologies, innovative engineering allows one protocol to carry another. This is where Ethernet over TDM comes in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ethernet over TDM utilizes TDM as the underlying transmission protocol, often using a T1 line as an example. T1 frames transmit at 1.5 Mbps, and Ethernet packets are loaded into these frames. The usual practice of dividing the T1 line into 24 channels is bypassed, allowing Ethernet packets to utilize the entire frame. This maintains compatibility with existing T1 interfaces and signal regenerators.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Combining Ethernet and TDM offers flexibility. Ethernet over Copper faces distance limitations, performing well within a short range but experiencing signal degradation over longer distances. T1, on the other hand, offers greater distance coverage and consistent bandwidth, even in remote areas. Furthermore, the well-established nature of T1 lines makes them more widely available compared to the relatively newer Ethernet over Copper.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re seeking the advantages of Ethernet, including bandwidth scalability, seamless network integration, and standardized services like Ethernet Line and Ethernet LAN, but lack access to Ethernet over Copper or Ethernet over Fiber, consider Ethernet over TDM. Also referred to as Ethernet over T1 or Ethernet over DS1, you can explore pricing and availability for Copper Ethernet Services.&lt;/p>

While the automatic posting functions properly, occasional batch errors require a way to generate a comprehensive list of problematic batches across all databases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Preliminary investigation suggests that the BCHSTTUS field in the SY00500 table, which indicates batch status, could be the key. A Microsoft KB article provides further details on the values for this field.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A SQL query focusing on this field was proposed as a starting point:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>SELECT * FROM TWO..SY00500 WHERE BCHSTTUS &amp;gt; 6&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, this solution is not ideal for running across 150 databases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To address this, a more complex SQL query utilizing a temporary table and a cursor was implemented. This query iterates through all company databases and populates the temporary table with the count of records with a batch status greater than 6.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While this approach works, it&amp;rsquo;s not certain if the batch status field is the sole indicator of batch recovery.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An alternative solution was suggested, leveraging a UNION ALL statement built dynamically through a join with sys.databases. This approach eliminates the need for a temporary table and a cursor, resulting in a more compact and efficient query.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Yes, user names in Dynamics GP are case sensitive.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/yes-user-names-in-dynamics-gp-are-case-sensitive/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 May 2024 12:18:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/yes-user-names-in-dynamics-gp-are-case-sensitive/</guid><description>&lt;p>By Steve Endow&lt;/p>

Imagine 1 Gbps speeds on copper lines for businesses!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While this technology isn&amp;rsquo;t widespread yet, it&amp;rsquo;s rapidly approaching. Huawei, a Chinese company specializing in networking and telecommunications, has developed a prototype Giga DSL system capable of delivering a combined speed of 1 Gbps within 100 meters of a remote terminal (RT) cabinet. The speed scales down to 500 Mbps at a distance of 200 meters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This innovation follows Huawei&amp;rsquo;s SuperMIMO project, which utilizes four twisted copper pairs to achieve speeds of 700 Mbps over 400 meters. MIMO, short for Multiple Input Multiple Output, is the same antenna technology used in WiFi 802.3n to enhance range by employing multiple antennas for both transmission and reception. This technology combats multipath distortion, where radio waves interfere with each other. Using multiple antennas and intelligent system design, wave patterns are deciphered to reconstruct a clear signal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But what does wireless transmission have to do with underground copper wires? Business telecommunications systems, such as multi-line phones, T1, and Ethernet over Copper, don&amp;rsquo;t use individual twisted pair lines. Instead, they are bundled together in binder cables containing 50 or more pairs. These twisted conductors effectively eliminate electromagnetic interference in low-speed transmissions like analog phone calls and dial-up internet. However, high-speed signals, such as EoC or T1, can leak into adjacent pairs within the cable, causing crosstalk interference. This is where MIMO technology comes in, mitigating interference between these wired paths, much like it addresses interference in wireless transmissions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other telecom equipment manufacturers are also making strides in this area. Alcatel-Lucent has developed DSL Phantom Mode, a technology that delivers 300 Mbps over two copper pairs, and 100 Mbps over distances up to 1 km. With its 1 km reach, this system is ideal for Ethernet over Copper in business districts and industrial parks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The key to Alcatel-Lucent&amp;rsquo;s breakthrough is the &amp;ldquo;phantom circuit.&amp;rdquo; This technique, used in early wired communication, allowed for the transmission of additional telegraph signals or phone calls. Two phone lines, each using a twisted pair, could carry two separate calls. By connecting a circuit between them, a third call or telegraph signal could be transmitted. Transformers at each end of the lines, with the third circuit connected between their center taps, eliminate interference. This setup allows the &amp;ldquo;phantom circuit&amp;rdquo; to share the copper lines without disrupting the balanced lines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Further enhancing bandwidth capacity, Alcatel-Lucent also employs bonded copper pairs. Additionally, they use VDSL2 vectoring to mitigate crosstalk between lines within a bundle. Similar to MIMO, vectoring utilizes digital signal processing to analyze and counteract interference effects on signals across copper pairs at the symbol level. This level of precision was impossible until recent advancements made high-speed DSP affordable. By applying complex mathematical algorithms to signal waveforms, it&amp;rsquo;s now possible to make incredibly precise adjustments, maximizing throughput for both wired and wireless transmissions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But what&amp;rsquo;s driving this intense research into maximizing the potential of century-old copper connections? The answer lies in the exponential growth of bandwidth demand, driven by the increasing processing and storage requirements of big data. The shift from local data centers to the cloud further fuels the need for faster network lines for both WAN and LAN connections. While fiber optic technology is advancing and offering higher speeds, it&amp;rsquo;s only accessible to 75% of businesses at most. Plus, installation can be expensive and time-consuming. If existing copper infrastructure can be optimized to meet the growing need for bandwidth, businesses can quickly enhance their MAN and WAN network speeds using their current connections.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If your network is feeling the need for speed, both copper and fiber solutions are available today that were nonexistent just a short time ago. Explore current pricing and options for &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.CopperEthernet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

Recently, while working with a large Dynamics GP customer that processes thousands of international AP payments each month, he discovered a challenging problem. This company often experiences unsuccessful payment deliveries due to various reasons like incorrect payment information. The high volume of failed payments requires them to void and reissue hundreds of payments monthly in Dynamics GP, a very time-consuming process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To address this, Steve developed an automated solution to void payments in GP. During testing, he encountered a scenario where the same check or payment number was issued from multiple checkbooks in Dynamics GP. This meant a vendor could receive two payments with the same check number but from different checkbooks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Void Historical Payables Transactions window in Dynamics GP doesn&amp;rsquo;t readily display the checkbook ID, making it difficult to determine which payment to void automatically. A manual user could investigate each payment individually, but an automated solution requires additional logic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This situation highlights that even seemingly improbable scenarios can occur in ERP systems, particularly with flexible functionalities like in Dynamics GP. Consequently, custom solutions become necessary to handle these unique situations, even if they seem unlikely.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2x2 Ethernet Takes on T-1</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/2x2-ethernet-takes-on-t-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 May 2024 13:36:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/2x2-ethernet-takes-on-t-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>For the past decade, small and medium businesses have relied on T1 lines as their primary commercial telecom solution. However, a new competitor called 2x2 Ethernet, recently introduced by major nationwide carrier MegaPath, is emerging to challenge the long-standing T1. Let&amp;rsquo;s explore what 2x2 Ethernet offers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.etherrabbit.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;img src="http://www.EtherRabbit.com/images/EthernetOverCopperBadge250.gif"
loading="lazy"
alt="Ethernet over Copper has significant cost and performance advantages. Click for service availability."
>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It might seem surprising that T1 lines would face competition, considering their 50-year history and widespread adoption. As the first widely available broadband digital connection for businesses, T1 emerged from telephone company research. Initially used to connect calls between switching centers, it later became commercially available. Leveraging repeater technology and unshielded twisted pair telco wires, T1 became the leading technology for digital phone lines, point-to-point connections, and dedicated broadband access.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ethernet, on the other hand, originated in the computer industry and has become the dominant networking technology for local area networks (LANs). While traditionally considered a LAN technology, unlike the WAN-focused T1, Ethernet has steadily expanded into metropolitan and wide area networks in recent years. Now, it&amp;rsquo;s poised to replace T1 lines altogether. But why?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bandwidth is a key factor. T1 lines offer a fixed, symmetrical bandwidth of 1.5 Mbps for both uploads and downloads. Ethernet, however, supports various speeds over copper and fiber optic cables. MegaPath&amp;rsquo;s 2x2 Ethernet provides 2 Mbps for both uploads and downloads, a modest but notable improvement over T1. Beyond the 33% capacity increase, 2x2 Ethernet offers simple integration. Connecting from WAN to LAN is as easy as using a standard Ethernet connector, eliminating the need for additional CSU/DSU interface circuitry required by T1 lines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most compelling aspect of MegaPath&amp;rsquo;s 2x2 Ethernet is its affordability compared to T1 lines. While Ethernet has often boasted lower per-Mbps costs than traditional telecom services, particularly at higher bandwidths, this 2 Mbps service undercuts the price of a 1.5 Mbps service. Additionally, customers can choose between data-only or voice and data configurations. Opting for at least five lines of digital, analog, or SIP trunking telephone service further reduces the cost of a 2x2 Ethernet line. These factors suggest that the era of T1 dominance might be coming to an end.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MegaPath has addressed availability concerns by offering Ethernet over Copper connections through 1,900 central offices across the country, covering an estimated 90% of businesses, both small and large. MegaPath itself is a &amp;ldquo;super CLEC&amp;rdquo; (Competitive Local Exchange Carrier), formed by merging MegaPath, Covad, and Speakeasy, all significant carriers in their own right.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If your business needs new connectivity or you&amp;rsquo;re simply seeking a better deal on your current T1 line service, it&amp;rsquo;s worth exploring your options. Older T1 contracts could be costing you double what they should. Consider a &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.etherrabbit.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>quick pricing and availability inquiry for Ethernet over Copper services&lt;/a> to be sure. Higher bandwidth options are also available for more demanding applications.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Several factors have converged to make this the opportune moment for nationwide WiMAX broadband, with Sprint being the ideal company to spearhead it. WiMAX is reaching maturity, with numerous trial deployments, solidified standards, and certified equipment being manufactured at scale. WiMAX&amp;rsquo;s global dominance has been evident, with the only question being the timing of its widespread adoption. It seems mid-2006 marks a significant milestone, with services slated to commence by the end of the following year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sprint is committed to deploying the IEEE802.16e-2005 Mobile WiMAX standard due to its adaptability for both fixed and mobile data transfers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sprint and Nextel are primarily known as cell phone providers, and their immediate application for WiMAX is to enhance existing services such as SprintTV video on demand, music downloads, and other 3G entertainment options. Sprint intends to deploy its 4G WiMAX network alongside its 3G EV-DO network, with Motorola and Samsung manufacturing devices compatible with both. Similar to current 3G devices that transition between speeds depending on coverage, the new networks will fall back from WiMAX to EV-DO outside metropolitan WiMAX deployment areas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beyond enhancing video downloads, WiMAX offers significant potential. Its design as a wireless Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) enables broadband internet service delivery to laptops and desktops, covering up to 31 miles with shared bandwidth up to 70 Mbps. Sprint is projected to deliver 2 to 4 Mbps bandwidth to fixed and mobile users, a substantial improvement over 3G speeds. This makes WiMAX an attractive alternative to DSL and cable broadband, especially with Intel&amp;rsquo;s plan to incorporate WiMAX solutions into its Centrino Mobile Technology devices. Consequently, we can anticipate the emergence of devices with built-in WiMAX alongside WiFi, including wireless access points and routers equipped with a WiMAX transceiver for WAN and WiFi for LAN.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Furthermore, Sprint and Nextel can leverage WiMAX technology to backhaul their cellular phone traffic. Currently, many cell towers rely on T1 landlines with limited bandwidth. Implementing WiMAX on towers for customer broadband service presents an opportunity to replace these lines with long-range radio carriers, creating a system upgrade and potentially reducing costs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another factor contributing to Sprint&amp;rsquo;s decision is the need to utilize their extensive 2.5 GHz band licenses effectively. Both Sprint and Nextel hold significant licenses in this former MMDS band, covering over 85% of households in the top 100 U.S. markets. This valuable spectrum is currently underutilized. Moreover, Sprint Nextel is obligated to establish a 2.5 GHz network reaching at least 30 million people by the end of the decade as part of their merger agreement with the FCC. Sprint Nextel aims to surpass this commitment, targeting 100 million people by the end of 2008.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sprint Nextel possesses a valuable asset in their 2.5 GHz band, highly suitable for WiMAX transmissions. These frequencies penetrate buildings more effectively than the 3.5 GHz and 5.8 GHz bands, also designated for WiMAX. This presents an opportunity to replace wireline broadband services and enable practical indoor and in-vehicle roaming. Eventually, WiFi hotspots may become obsolete, similar to dial-up internet service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A nationwide WiMAX network will likely foster the development of innovative business and consumer mobile services that demand greater bandwidth. This includes applications like full-motion video conferencing, streaming audio and video, large database applications, and mobile simulations and presentations. The prospect of widespread WiMAX might even prompt faster deployment of fiber optic networks and further innovation in mobile applications.&lt;/p>

This shift to an IP-based network and the use of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for telephone trunking are rendering traditional telephony services obsolete. By utilizing a packet-switched network and transmitting everything in packet protocol, voice, and data traffic can easily share a single circuit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The concept of convergence, using one network for voice, video, and data, has gained traction with IT departments aiming to simplify network management and executives seeking cost reductions. However, the disparity between local area networks and wide area network services has posed a challenge. The need for protocol conversion and call termination to bridge the gap between IP inside the organization and TDM outside has been a significant obstacle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>XO&amp;rsquo;s IPfolio changes this paradigm in two key ways. Firstly, its suite of IP services runs on a single network, allowing businesses to create customized solutions by seamlessly mixing and matching services. This &amp;ldquo;telecom buffet&amp;rdquo; offers options like IP VPNs, SIP-based telephone trunking, and dedicated internet access with dynamic bandwidth allocation. Voice is treated as a data application, which is key to achieving network convergence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Secondly, and more disruptively, IPfolio pricing is based on Mbps used, not by feature, bundle, or service. With bandwidth options from 1.5 to 45 Mbps, businesses get unlimited local and inter-site calls. This SIP-based VoIP telephony eliminates channel or &amp;ldquo;line&amp;rdquo; limitations – enabling as many simultaneous calls as the bandwidth allows. The service is compatible with major PBX systems like Cisco and Avaya. Optional long-distance plans ranging from 2,000 to 40,000 minutes per month are also available.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The XO MPLS IP-VPN, part of IPfolio, provides a secure MPLS network solution with VPN capabilities to connect multiple business locations. Its multiple service classes ensure smooth application performance and prevent large data downloads from disrupting real-time voice communication.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>XO IPfolio aims to provide a comprehensive suite of communication services with IP-based pricing. Introduced in 2007 in select cities, IPfolio is now available nationwide.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If your business could benefit from converged IP services or more cost-effective traditional line services, contact our expert consultants for competitive, customized quotes. You might be surprised at the potential savings compared to your current solutions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Gigabit WiFi For Video Streaming</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/gigabit-wifi-for-video-streaming/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2024 10:13:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/gigabit-wifi-for-video-streaming/</guid><description>&lt;p>WiFi has become the standard wireless connection due to its widespread availability, outpacing technologies like Bluetooth and WiMax. While cellular data is useful in the absence of WiFi, its limited bandwidth and potential for overage charges make it a secondary choice. In fact, data shows that most tablet users don&amp;rsquo;t even utilize their device&amp;rsquo;s cellular capabilities. WiFi&amp;rsquo;s strength is evident in its ability to not only replace cellular broadband but also wired connections.&lt;/p>

&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Setting up Ethernet cables in homes and offices is a challenge for many, leading to a reliance on strategically placed WiFi routers to provide internet access throughout a space. The convenience of WiFi is further amplified by the increasing availability of WiFi-enabled PCs and printers, offering users greater flexibility in device placement.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>However, the limitations of physical cables persist in video transmission, with traditional coaxial and HDMI cables being necessary for connecting devices. While older coaxial cables are restricted to standard-definition video, even the higher-quality HDMI cables pose a challenge in terms of installation and reach within a home.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Adding to the complexity is the convergence of traditional video sources like satellite and DVDs with internet-based content. Now, televisions, Blu-ray players, and gaming consoles often come equipped with Ethernet ports, primarily for streaming high-bandwidth video content. This begs the question: can a wireless solution effectively replace these wired connections for video transmission?&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>While earlier WiFi standards like 802.11b/g fall short of the requirements for seamless video streaming, the newer 802.11n standard, though improved, still faces challenges with bandwidth and interference in the crowded 2.4 GHz frequency band. This is where the enhanced WiFi 802.11ac, or &amp;ldquo;WiFi-AC,&amp;rdquo; comes in.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>What sets WiFi-AC apart is its significant increase in bandwidth, exceeding one gigabit per second. With a projected capacity of nearly seven gigabytes per second for an eight-antenna system, WiFi-AC is poised to handle the demands of high-definition and 3D video streaming, potentially eliminating the need for Ethernet, HDMI, and coaxial cables in both homes and offices.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>This performance leap in WiFi-AC is achieved by utilizing the less congested 5 GHz frequency band and employing wider transmission channels. Unlike 802.11n&amp;rsquo;s 40 MHz channels, WiFi-AC utilizes a minimum of 80 MHz channels, expandable up to 160 MHz, allowing for greater data transfer rates.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>WiFi-N introduced MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) antenna technology, which improves signal quality and strength by analyzing multiple received signals and filtering out interference. WiFi-AC leverages this technology and enhances it with a more sophisticated modulation scheme known as 256 QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation). This allows for more efficient use of the spectrum, translating to higher data rates compared to the 64 QAM used in 802.11n.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>With Broadcom&amp;rsquo;s recent announcement of the first 802.11ac supporting chipset, which they are calling &amp;ldquo;5G WiFi,&amp;rdquo; consumers can anticipate seeing WiFi-AC equipped devices in the market by late this year or early next year. This new generation of WiFi technology is set to bring significant performance improvements, similar to the generational leaps witnessed in cellular technology (2G, 3G, 4G).&lt;/p>

But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you need a bunch of fax machines in your office. You can send and receive faxes online, wherever you are, with the right fax plan.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead of a clunky fax machine, a fax service plan is much more practical. Fax machines can only send faxes and take up space, while a fax service plan lets you send and receive faxes digitally through email and an online account, using your computer or laptop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You might remember older fax software that needed a special modem and monopolized your computer and phone line. Modern fax services are totally different. You don&amp;rsquo;t need a fax modem or even a phone line because it works entirely online, just like other internet-based applications.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Signing up for an internet fax service plan like RingCentral, or even trying their free trial, gives you a dedicated toll-free or local fax number. This virtual fax number allows other fax machines to send faxes directly to your online account, and you&amp;rsquo;ll receive them as emails. You can even get notifications about new faxes on your phone, so you won&amp;rsquo;t miss anything urgent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sending faxes is also easy. You can send a fax straight from your email, with your email becoming the cover sheet and any attached documents becoming the fax itself. There&amp;rsquo;s also free software that adds a fax button to programs like Microsoft Word and Outlook, letting you fax documents with a single click. You can even use a digital version of your signature, so no printing, signing, or scanning is needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An internet fax service is just as powerful as a traditional fax machine. You can create groups to send faxes to multiple people at once, all without tying up a phone line. The system will even notify you when your faxes are delivered. You can customize cover sheets and choose from various page styles using either the software or the online account. You can also block junk faxes to keep your inbox clean.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The best part is that you don&amp;rsquo;t even need your computer to be on to receive faxes, and senders will never get a busy signal. It&amp;rsquo;s all online!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Best of all, these plans are affordable, starting at $7.99 per month for 300 pages, with a small fee for additional pages. If you send a lot of faxes, there are plans for up to 2,500 pages each month. And that price includes your dedicated fax number, which could cost as much as the entire plan from other providers.&lt;/p>

This technology would replace laptops that contractors currently rely on, offering features like digital forms, planning documents, and even invoice printing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While this is helpful for construction workers, an in-dash computer could benefit others, too. Salespeople, consultants, and anyone who conducts business on-the-go could manage messages, documents, orders, receipts, and faxes directly from their vehicles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Though laptops already offer these capabilities, an in-dash computer could integrate with a car&amp;rsquo;s existing systems. For example, by connecting a general-purpose PC to the navigation system and incorporating broadband internet access, we could access real-time features like weather radar superimposed onto the map.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Furthermore, this technology could replace traditional radios by streaming online services like Pandora through a robust broadband connection, potentially outperforming satellite and over-the-air radio. Local content might then become more unique and valuable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With wireless internet and a printer, GPS systems could expand to provide full website access for restaurants, stores, services, and tourist spots, allowing users to purchase tickets or order ahead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Naturally, driver distraction is a concern. However, passengers could utilize the in-dash computer safely, with potential for remote screens, game controls, and keyboards in the backseat. This could transform travel into an interactive experience with educational games or scavenger hunts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Combined with hands-free calling and video conferencing, the in-dash computer could become a comprehensive communication hub. The possibilities seem endless when you have the power of a PC with broadband internet access directly within your dashboard.&lt;/p>

Their latest product, Eye-Fi Explore, automatically adds geotags to photos as you take them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You might be surprised to learn that they haven&amp;rsquo;t actually included a GPS receiver in the small SD card. Instead, it uses a system that determines location based on known WiFi hotspots. This method covers a significant portion of the U.S. population and major metropolitan areas in Europe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Eye-Fi Explore comes with a year of access to 10,000 Wayport WiFi hotspots across the US. These hotspots are essential because they allow the Eye-Fi card to automatically upload photos to the internet or your home network without the need for cables.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The partnership with Wayport means the Explore card is already configured to use their hotspots. When you enter a Wayport location, your photos upload automatically while you go about your business. If the upload is interrupted, it will resume at the next Wayport hotspot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This technology essentially acts as a digital assistant, handling the task of transferring your photos. It also eliminates the need to remember photo locations, as the geotagging feature provides that information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If this technology seems beneficial, check out the Eye-Fi Explore Wireless 2 GB Secure Digital Card (EYE-FI-2EX).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Today, researchers have developed ultracapacitors, like the Graphene Ultracapacitor from the University of Texas at Austin, which are essentially very small but powerful capacitors. These ultracapacitors use nanometer-thin dielectrics instead of bulky glass jars, allowing them to achieve farad-level capacitance, much higher than the picofarad capacity of a Leyden Jar.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This increased capacity means ultracapacitors can act more like batteries, able to power devices for longer periods than traditional capacitors. While capacitors could only deliver a brief jolt of electricity, often used for pranks in electronics classes, ultracapacitors have the potential to power devices like cell phones. The author recounts a memorable incident where a student mistakenly connected an electrolytic capacitor to a wall outlet, resulting in a small explosion. Thankfully, capacitors at that time were not as powerful as modern ultracapacitors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Both capacitors and batteries can act as power sources, but capacitors have the advantage of charging rapidly. Although limited by their size in storing a significant amount of power, advancements in material science like graphene are paving the way for ultracapacitors to potentially power everything from cell phones and computers to watches and even hybrid vehicles, much like high-tech versions of Leyden Jars.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The next electrical task involved replacing the RPM indicator lamps. This was crucial as LED replacements had proven to improve platter motor stability during testing. It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that the RPM indicator lamps are integral to the platter motor&amp;rsquo;s control circuit, and each speed indicator has a dedicated pitch (speed) adjustment knob.&lt;/p>

However, more bandwidth usually means higher expenses, creating a difficult situation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s generally accepted that increasing bandwidth leads to increased costs. For instance, 10 Mbps will likely cost more than 1 Mbps, although there might be a volume discount. But is it possible to get more bandwidth while paying less overall? This idea seems counterintuitive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Telecom pricing traditionally wouldn&amp;rsquo;t support this idea, but there are two ways to achieve more bandwidth at a lower cost, particularly with dedicated internet connections and point-to-point private lines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first approach involves moving your operations to a colocation facility, also known as a carrier hotel. These facilities house equipment from multiple carriers, making bandwidth readily available. You can lease space for your servers and connect to the desired bandwidth with minimal construction costs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second approach is Metro Ethernet or Carrier Ethernet. These services provide Ethernet speeds ranging from 10 Mbps to 1000 Mbps at competitive rates. While higher bandwidth levels typically require fiber optic connections, lower speeds can sometimes utilize existing copper wiring.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Remarkably, 100 Mbps Fast Ethernet service often costs less than traditional 45 Mbps DS3 bandwidth. This means you can double your speed for less money, offering a significant advantage for businesses seeking growth.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What is an Ethernet Connection?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-is-an-ethernet-connection/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 May 2024 22:15:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-is-an-ethernet-connection/</guid><description>&lt;p>When we consider connecting to the wider world, traditional telecom services like POTS, PRI, T1, DS3, and OCx SONET often come to mind. However, Carrier Ethernet, a newer technology that extends Ethernet from the LAN to the WAN, is worth examining.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.copperethernet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;img src="http://www.CopperEthernet.com/images/EthernetOverCopperBadge250.gif"

alt="Compare services and pricing for Ethernet WAN connections&amp;hellip;"
>&lt;/a> Extending an Ethernet connection from a building or campus to a distant location might seem strange considering traditional telecom&amp;rsquo;s long-standing dominance. However, the landscape is changing with new providers entering the market, unburdened by legacy telco standards. This allows for a fresh perspective on WAN design, pricing, and services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For this discussion, let&amp;rsquo;s assume the WAN starts where the LAN ends, acknowledging that the MAN, or Metropolitan Area Network, often sits between them. While MAN and WAN technologies are similar, differing mainly in scale, WAN services can span regional, national, or even international boundaries, unlike MANs which typically cover a city and its surrounding areas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ethernet, the dominant packet switching protocol for LANs, wasn&amp;rsquo;t always so widespread. Decades ago, standards like Token Ring competed for dominance. However, Ethernet&amp;rsquo;s popularity and cost-effectiveness have solidified its position in the LAN market. While only recently gaining traction in the WAN space, Ethernet may very well replicate its success in the local and metropolitan network environments in the coming years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to the Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF)&amp;rsquo;s standardization efforts, Carrier Ethernet overcomes the distance limitations of traditional LAN Ethernet, enabling connections that span the globe. By standardizing Ethernet services, the MEF ensures interoperability between different carriers, fostering competition and driving down costs for consumers. This standardization also allows carriers to expand their reach by interconnecting through Ethernet Network to Network Interfaces (E-NNI).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>WAN Ethernet offers several advantages over legacy telecom services. Firstly, the interface is much simpler: unlike T1 or DS3 connections requiring specialized equipment, an Ethernet connection can be established using a standard RJ-45 jack or a managed router.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Secondly, Ethernet offers flexible service options. Ethernet Line Service provides point-to-point or last-mile dedicated Internet connections, similar to T1 or DS3. Ethernet LAN service, on the other hand, offers multipoint networking, connecting multiple business locations without the need for individual private lines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unlike T-Carrier and SONET services, Ethernet is highly scalable. Bandwidth can be adjusted easily, often with a simple phone call to the provider, eliminating the need for equipment replacement and downtime.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, Ethernet WAN connections offer cost benefits, often providing double the bandwidth for the price of a T1 line. These savings become even more substantial at higher speeds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s worth comparing Ethernet WAN services and pricing with your current setup to determine if you are missing out on potential cost and performance advantages. Ethernet WAN is available over both twisted pair copper and fiber optic cabling.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>While a temporary solution was found for a specific task, the same problem resurfaced during the next phase of the project, halting progress.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Determined to find a permanent fix, I investigated the eConnect Requester SOP10100 Insert Trigger. My findings revealed a significant bug, likely present for at least eight years across various GP versions, including 2015, 2013, and 2010. Surprisingly, this bug seems to have gone unnoticed or unaddressed for several years, with users likely finding workarounds without questioning the root cause.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, I&amp;rsquo;m currently tasked with untangling a decade-old integration heavily reliant on the Requester (using MSMQ, no less). To proceed, I must find a way to overcome this bug.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s examine the trigger&amp;rsquo;s logic and understand why the Sales Transaction Insert trigger fails.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When enabling the Sales_Transaction &amp;ldquo;SO_Trans&amp;rdquo; Insert Trigger, eConnect Requester generates a trigger on the SOP10100 table. This trigger includes a substantial amount of SQL code that uses a cursor to iterate through inserted records, giving the impression of functionality. However, entering an SOP transaction in Dynamics GP results in an empty eConnect_Out table, indicating a problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Investigating further with SQL Server Profiler reveals that the trigger activates and the cursor fetches data, but the eConnect_Out table remains empty. This suggests a condition in the trigger script is preventing the SOP record from being processed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The issue lies in the fact that an &lt;strong>Insert&lt;/strong> trigger on the SOP10100 table doesn&amp;rsquo;t capture records when an SOP transaction is &lt;strong>saved&lt;/strong>. This is because Dynamics GP utilizes placeholder records in the SOP10100 table.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When initiating an SOP transaction in GP, a placeholder record with blank values is inserted into the SOP10100 table as soon as the Document Number (SOPNUMBE) appears in the Sales Transaction Entry window. This placeholder record is only updated upon saving the transaction, populating fields like the customer number. Notably, the Dex Row ID remains unchanged, confirming an &lt;strong>update&lt;/strong> operation, not a deletion followed by an insertion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The SO_Trans trigger&amp;rsquo;s logic hinges on the presence of a Customer Number (CUSTNMBR) to write the transaction to the eConnect_Out table. Since the placeholder record initially lacks this value, the trigger doesn&amp;rsquo;t execute the intended action.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Therefore, due to the placeholder system in SOP10100 and the trigger&amp;rsquo;s design, the eConnect Requester SOP10100 Insert trigger remains ineffective, never populating the eConnect_Out table.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What alternatives exist for those facing this challenge?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One option is to utilize the eConnect Requester Sales_Transaction Line trigger instead. This can provide notification of a new Sales Transaction, depending on the specific requirements.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While the eConnect Requester Update trigger for SOP10100 might seem viable, it presents complications. Every update to an existing SOP transaction would populate the eConnect_Out table, requiring additional filtering to isolate relevant entries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a next step, I plan to test the Line trigger on SOP10200, hoping it offers a suitable workaround without unexpected side effects.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
