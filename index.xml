However, the process was resurrected in 2019 and has advanced quickly since then...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/overview-and-analysis-of-the-relaunched-negotiations-for-eu-accession-to-the-echr/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/overview-and-analysis-of-the-relaunched-negotiations-for-eu-accession-to-the-echr/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Now in Hong Kong, exclusive to employees</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/now-in-hong-kong-exclusive-to-employees/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2024 13:43:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/now-in-hong-kong-exclusive-to-employees/</guid><description>Source: Employees Only.

A UK exit from the European Union, or &amp;ldquo;Brexit,&amp;rdquo; could have significant implications for young people, impacting their education, travel opportunities, and economic prospects.
Education
The EU does not control educational content or matters like tuition costs.

The initial Common European Asylum System (CEAS) legislation defined &amp;lsquo;subsidiary protection,&amp;rsquo; which protects individuals ineligible for refugee status but shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be returned to their home country. However, other initial CEAS legislation, particularly the asylum procedures Directive, didn&amp;rsquo;t cover those seeking subsidiary protection or clarify the connection between refugee and subsidiary protection statuses.
This gap has been addressed in several ways. Firstly, future second-phase CEAS legislation fully applies to subsidiary protection applicants and defines the relationship between refugee and subsidiary protection statuses...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/rights-to-due-process-and-secondary-protection/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/rights-to-due-process-and-secondary-protection/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Part 1: The Legal Framework - Should the EU impose sanctions on its Member States for violations of the rule of law and human rights?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/part-1-the-legal-framework-should-the-eu-impose-sanctions-on-its-member-states-for-violations-of-the-rule-of-law-and-human-rights/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 06:43:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/part-1-the-legal-framework-should-the-eu-impose-sanctions-on-its-member-states-for-violations-of-the-rule-of-law-and-human-rights/</guid><description>Professor Steve Peers, University of Essex
As an EU law and human rights professor for over two decades, the topic of sanctioning Member States for human rights violations was once straightforward.

However, the landscape has shifted. Like Article 50, which also addresses the EU&amp;rsquo;s relationship with Member States, Article 7 seems hastily drafted without considering its practical application, possibly because its creators never anticipated its use...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/part-1-the-legal-framework-should-the-eu-impose-sanctions-on-its-member-states-for-violations-of-the-rule-of-law-and-human-rights/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/part-1-the-legal-framework-should-the-eu-impose-sanctions-on-its-member-states-for-violations-of-the-rule-of-law-and-human-rights/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Join us at Smile Singapore in Clarke Quay Central and share your beautiful smile with us!</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/join-us-at-smile-singapore-in-clarke-quay-central-and-share-your-beautiful-smile-with-us/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2024 23:50:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/join-us-at-smile-singapore-in-clarke-quay-central-and-share-your-beautiful-smile-with-us/</guid><description>The installation of the Smile project at Clarke Quay Central is currently underway.

It&amp;rsquo;s evident that broadband internet access is crucial for businesses, education, and individuals. Schools and libraries, in particular, require online access to thrive in today&amp;rsquo;s digital age.
Schools &amp;amp; Libraries are Lagging Surprisingly, many elementary schools and libraries lack adequate internet access. They require modern broadband speeds, surpassing the outdated megabit per second standard. Today&amp;rsquo;s requirements necessitate fiber optic connections.
The FCC acknowledges this need, promoting internet speeds of at least 100 Mbps per 1,000 users for schools and libraries, with plans to increase this to 1,000 Mbps...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/e-rate-supports-gigabit-internet-for-schools-libraries/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/e-rate-supports-gigabit-internet-for-schools-libraries/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Get Ready For The Recovery With Bandwidth on Demand</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/get-ready-for-the-recovery-with-bandwidth-on-demand/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 19:05:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/get-ready-for-the-recovery-with-bandwidth-on-demand/</guid><description>The economy is recovering, benefiting some businesses while others struggle. Maintaining earnings through cost-cutting instead of increased sales won&amp;rsquo;t be sustainable. When the economy fully recovers, rapid adaptation will be crucial, but increased expenses are only justifiable with increased revenue. Bandwidth on demand offers a solution.
Bandwidth on demand allows businesses to access and pay for only the bandwidth they currently need, scaling usage up or down as required.

This allows providers to bypass fees associated with leasing traditional copper phone lines, leading to more attractive bundled packages for customers. Theoretically, the internet&amp;rsquo;s capacity should easily accommodate low-bandwidth voice data.
However, this isn&amp;rsquo;t always the case in reality. Internet paths, much like highways, can become congested, leading to bandwidth constraints, transmission delays (latency), and dropped data packets, all of which disrupt real-time communication like phone calls...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/voip-without-the-internet/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/voip-without-the-internet/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Identifying SQL Server Users without a Corresponding Login</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/identifying-sql-server-users-without-a-corresponding-login/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jun 2024 21:20:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/identifying-sql-server-users-without-a-corresponding-login/</guid><description>Let&amp;rsquo;s imagine two situations: First, you set up a test Dynamics GP server for a client by installing SQL Server and Dynamics GP, then restoring database copies.

A fundamental principle within EU law concerning the freedom of movement posits that it primarily pertains to EU citizens residing in a Member State different from their home country. Consequently, EU citizens residing in their own Member State cannot generally invoke this law. However, ECJ case law sometimes permits them to assert rights based on their EU citizenship.

Customers occasionally report login issues with Dynamics GP, despite correctly entering their newly created user credentials.
If this happens, verify the capitalization of the GP user ID.
For example, using &amp;ldquo;testuser&amp;rdquo; to log in fails, as the accurate User ID is &amp;ldquo;TestUser&amp;rdquo;.
Unlike most software, Dynamics GP user IDs are case-sensitive. Therefore, always double-check the capitalization of user IDs if login problems occur.

It&amp;rsquo;s important to remember: there&amp;rsquo;s no need to panic! These gaps are normal.
Think of it this way: Dynamics GP assigns numbers as transactions are created, not when they&amp;rsquo;re finalized. For instance, if three people start invoices, they&amp;rsquo;ll get numbers 1, 2, and 3. If the second person deletes their invoice before saving, the next invoice will be number 4, leaving a gap...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/oh-no-transaction-numbers-are-missing/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/oh-no-transaction-numbers-are-missing/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Groundbreaking ceremony finished for the Fujairah Business Centre, a mixed-use development</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/groundbreaking-ceremony-finished-for-the-fujairah-business-centre-a-mixed-use-development/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 May 2024 04:54:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/groundbreaking-ceremony-finished-for-the-fujairah-business-centre-a-mixed-use-development/</guid><description>Al Taif Investment, a collaboration between Dubai Investments and Fujairah Investment Establishment (FIE), the investment branch of the Fujairah Government, has launched its flagship Fujairah Business Centre project.

Latency is the time it takes for data packets to travel between two points. While insignificant on local networks, latency can pose major problems on long-distance WAN connections, especially for applications where speed is critical.
It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that latency and bandwidth are not directly related. You can have slow connections with minimal latency and blazing-fast connections with terrible latency...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/low-latency-wan-options/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/low-latency-wan-options/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Miramar Hotel Group offer now available with Asia Miles</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/miramar-hotel-group-offer-now-available-with-asia-miles/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2024 20:04:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/miramar-hotel-group-offer-now-available-with-asia-miles/</guid><description>Source: Miramar Hotel Taipei website.

The UK Government&amp;rsquo;s proposition to exclude the EU&amp;rsquo;s Charter of Fundamental Rights (the Charter) from UK law after Brexit (clause 5(4) of the EU Withdrawal Bill) has drawn criticism from opposition parties. The Labour party views this as a non-negotiable issue and refuses to endorse any bill that doesn&amp;rsquo;t integrate the Charter into UK law. Keir Starmer, the Shadow Brexit Secretary, previously stated that Labour would only back a deal that meets its &amp;ldquo;six tests,&amp;rdquo; one being the preservation of &amp;ldquo;rights and protections&amp;rdquo; to avoid a decline in standards...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/mastering-the-art-of-releasing-control-the-charter-of-fundamental-rights-post-brexit/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/mastering-the-art-of-releasing-control-the-charter-of-fundamental-rights-post-brexit/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Fiber Is The New Infrastructure</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/fiber-is-the-new-infrastructure/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2024 15:10:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/fiber-is-the-new-infrastructure/</guid><description>The current focus on infrastructure often overlooks a critical element: fiber optic broadband.

The EU legal system is often viewed as a distinct entity, separate from both international and national law. Within this system, safeguarding fundamental rights is paramount. Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) establishes a three-pronged approach to fundamental rights protection: 1) the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, 2) the EU&amp;rsquo;s commitment to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), and 3) general principles of EU law derived from the ECHR and shared constitutional values of member states...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/unexpected-turn-of-events-case-c-128-18-dorobantu-the-conditions-of-detention-and-the-echr-s-relevance-in-the-eu-legal-system/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/unexpected-turn-of-events-case-c-128-18-dorobantu-the-conditions-of-detention-and-the-echr-s-relevance-in-the-eu-legal-system/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Remember to use the standard GP SQL views.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/remember-to-use-the-standard-gp-sql-views/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2024 02:36:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/remember-to-use-the-standard-gp-sql-views/</guid><description>Occasionally, we receive questions from individuals who are creating views in SQL Server that already exist.
