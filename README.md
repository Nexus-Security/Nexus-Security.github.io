## Who Are We

Nexus is a leading web-based science, research, and technology news website covering a full range of topics. These include physics, earth science, medicine, nanotechnology, electronics, space, biology, chemistry, computer sciences, engineering, mathematics, and other sciences and technologies.

We publish quality articles every day, offering some of the most comprehensive coverage of sci-tech developments worldwide.

### Our Mission

We aren't trying to be the first to break news stories. Our aim is to be your first resource for thoughtful content to educate about the technologies affecting the marketplace and your life.

### Our Approach

We're not a website for geeksâ€”we are the geeks. We're the people you turn to when:
- Your computer isn't working right
- You need to do something technical
- You want to understand the latest gadgets

We explain it all in simple, approachable terms. When providing instructions, we use a copious amount of screenshots that make technical processes easy to follow.
