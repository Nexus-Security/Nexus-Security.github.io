boards, there‚Äôs a lot of neat interactive projects that are now really easy to build and extend. For example, Adafruit has some super-cute digital AR puppets as part of our <a class=link href=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bluefruit-playground/id1489549571 target=_blank rel=noopener>Bluefruit Playground app</a>, it will come out as an update soon, all you‚Äôll need is a <a class=link href=https://www.adafruit.com/product/4333 target=_blank rel=noopener>Circuit Playground Express Bluefruit</a> and an iPhone or iPad (<a class=link href=https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/adafruit-industries/id492487674 target=_blank rel=noopener>listing of all apps here</a>).</p><p>It‚Äôs all wireless (Bluetooth Low Energy, BLE), there are no wires needed to move the puppet around, tilting the head up and down, opens and closes the mouth. With all the sensors from the Adafruit ecosystem you can connect up all sorts of things to make the puppet do even more.</p><p><a class=link href=https://www.adafruit.com/product/4333 target=_blank rel=noopener>Circuit Playground Express Bluefruit</a> has a microphone, so the mouth movement and more could be voice activated as well.</p><p><img src=https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2020/01/sparky.gif loading=lazy alt=Sparky></p><p>The <a class=link href=https://www.adafruit.com/product/4333 target=_blank rel=noopener>Circuit Playground Express Bluefruit</a> is small, runs off a battery, and packed with sensors. Kids can decorate a glove, or paper bag and have a real-life puppet, and also have a digital AR version on the phone/tablet.</p><p>For this demo (<a class=link href=https://youtu.be/K7nPh2p0_ak target=_blank rel=noopener>video</a>), Sparky the Blue Smoke monster has a green background behind them in the app. This is so the puppet can live in the digital world for live streaming.</p><p><img src=https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2020/01/digital_puppet_test.jpg loading=lazy alt="Digital Puppet Test"></p><p>All together at Adafruit we have 4+ weekly shows and being able to add a digital puppet for live interaction is some I‚Äôd like to do. To do it well, we need it to be easy to set up for production, easy to keep the frequency of publishing, and interactive with the community. Pictured above is the set up for this quickie demo.</p><p><img src=https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2020/01/puffy.gif loading=lazy alt=Puffy></p><p>You could even add a ‚Äúsip and puff‚Äù sensor (<a class=link href=https://www.adafruit.com/product/3965 target=_blank rel=noopener>Adafruit MPRLS Ported Pressure Sensor Breakout ‚Äì 0 to 25 PSI</a>) so when you blow in a tube the digital puppet can expand ‚Ä¶ digital puppet blowfish, a bird‚Äôs feathers can get puffy or shrink! <img src=https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png loading=lazy alt=üôÇ></p><p>Future updates may have different or custom puppets to choose from, use of camera or still image backgrounds, recording, etc. Part of the effort is to teach folks about how sensors work. From visualizing an accelerometer, to learning some Python maybe. Also, we want to make it easy to share stories with puppets on Instagram, TikTok, YouTube etc. Same fun clips, but with puppet friends.</p><p><img src=https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2020/01/puppets.jpg loading=lazy alt=Puppets></p><p>Pictured above are just some of our puppets (physical ones!) for our show ‚ÄúCircuit Playground‚Äù which teaches electronics and more.</p><p><img src=https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2020/01/characters.jpg loading=lazy alt=Characters></p><p><img src=https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2020/01/ar.jpg loading=lazy alt=Ar></p><p>Theese characters are also in our games, <a class=link href=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adafruit-ar/id1375722584 target=_blank rel=noopener>AR apps and more</a>.</p><p><a class=link href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjF7R1fz_OOXWHQhEVEI5Jqf18TQRr5Hu" target=_blank rel=noopener>The playlist above</a> is our series ‚ÄúLadyada‚Äôs E is for Electronics‚Äù, in each episode the topic is based on the letter, A for Ampere, B for Battery, C for Capacitor ‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre up to T is for Transistor, should be out in a few weeks.</p><p><a class=link href=https://www.adafruit.com/product/1000 target=_blank rel=noopener><img src=https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2020/01/coloringbook.jpg loading=lazy alt=Coloringbook></a></p><p>The Circuit Playground video series is based on our <a class=link href=https://www.adafruit.com/product/1000 target=_blank rel=noopener>coloring book you can buy or download for free to print at home</a>.</p><p>The physical puppet video series takes a lot of time, and they‚Äôre worth it! We also wanted a way for anyone to use these characters to make their own ‚Äúshows‚Äù, share them, and learn about electronics. All while using real electronics that we make here at Adafruit, a 100% women-owned open-source educational electronics company in NYC!</p><p>Over the last decade, I‚Äôve had a few on-and-off attempts to make it easier to have avatars, or digital puppets, or VR, or something for content creation. There are also a few new efforts and apps that are using very modern tech to do this. So, I figured I‚Äôd add that in this post as well starting with the most recent, going all the way back to over 14 years ago.</p><hr><h2 id=yopuppet-ar-hand-puppet-show>YoPuppet: AR Hand Puppet Show</h2><p>With near-desktop computing power and great cameras on phones, we‚Äôre finally seeing a combination of machine learning, vision tech, and puppetry!

I was trying to get some physical hardware to work with <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life target=_blank rel=noopener>Second Life</a>. The idea was if I could move around in the virtual world, I could get that avatar out in some way eventually. The photos above are part of the set up and from the event in DC (fund raiser for the <a class=link href=http://www.aje-dc.org/ target=_blank rel=noopener>East DC Fund,¬†Advocates for Justice and Education</a>).</p><p><img src=https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2020/01/rssSL.jpg loading=lazy alt=Rsssl></p><p>There was a virtual version of MAKE magazine, and I had virtual world(s) interacting with RSS to get news in and out of the real world to virtual. We had an area with projects from MAKE (like the Cigar Box Guitar), and one of the things we tried was to see if it was possible to add sensors to it in real-life and have it play in the virtual world.</p><p>The tech to get the avatars out was really slow, so it was not good for any type real world video at the time.</p><hr><h2 id=logitech-quickcam-orbit-mp--2006>Logitech Quickcam Orbit MP ‚Äì 2006</h2><p>A few months later, also about 14 years ago (April 2006), I recorded this <a class=link href=https://youtu.be/r7Gn2TyEyHw target=_blank rel=noopener>video</a> while senior editor at MAKE Magazine, it‚Äôs the Logitech Quickcam Orbit MP that, at the time, I thought would really get things moving with being able to make your own digital puppets. However, <a class=link href=https://www.logitech.com/en-us/video/webcams target=_blank rel=noopener>Logitech stopped making it</a>, they did not allow custom avatars, and all traces of the avatars are off their site. The video has 1 million views.</p><hr><h2 id=apple-sock-puppet--2005>Apple Sock Puppet ‚Äì 2005</h2><p><img src=https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2020/01/applesocks.jpg loading=lazy alt=Applesocks></p><p>And in April of 2005 Apple had released ‚ÄúiPod socks‚Äù so I had made a couple stop-motion puppet videos with a green iPod sock and Apple headphones since it looked like a frog. The idea was it would talk about Apple and iPods news. Here is Steve Jobs announcing the <a class=link href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmiKcMgzSTA" target=_blank rel=noopener>Apple iPod Socks</a>, they were <a class=link href=https://appleinsider.com/articles/12/09/26/apple-removes-ipod-socks-from-online-store target=_blank rel=noopener>removed from the Apple store in 2012</a>.</p><p><img src=https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2020/01/01-box.jpg loading=lazy alt=01-Box></p><p>The companion was a little robot made out of recycled Apple iPod packaging. It was the iFrog and iRobot news show.</p><hr><p>I could keep going with more past efforts, but think I‚Äôm gonna end it here <img src=https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png loading=lazy alt=üôÇ></p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-copyright><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="icon icon-tabler icon-tabler-copyright" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="2" stroke="currentcolor" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path stroke="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="9"/><path d="M14.5 9a3.5 4 0 100 6"/></svg><span>Licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</span></section></footer></article><footer class=site-footer><section class=copyright>&copy;
