Day turns to night as smoke extinguishes all light in the horrifying minutes before the red glow announces the imminence of the inferno. Flames leaping 200 feet into the air. Fire tornadoes. Terrified children at the helm of dinghies, piloting away from the flames, refugees in their own country.</p><p>The fires have <a class=link href=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/01/02/australian-bushfires-numbers-highlight-sheer-scale-unfolding/ target=_blank rel=noopener>already burned about 14.5 million acres</a> — an area almost as large as West Virginia, more than triple the area destroyed by the 2018 fires in California and six times the size of the 2019 fires in Amazonia. Canberra’s air on New Year’s Day was <a class=link href=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7841561/Canberra-rings-New-Year-worlds-worst-smoke.html target=_blank rel=noopener>the most polluted in the world</a> partly because of a plume of fire smoke as wide as Europe.</p><p>Scientists estimate that close to <a class=link href=https://www.news.com.au/technology/science/animals/half-a-billion-animals-perish-in-bushfires/news-story/b316adb4f3af7b1c8464cf186ab9f52c target=_blank rel=noopener>half a billion native animals have been killed</a> and fear that some species of animals and plants may have been wiped out completely. Surviving animals are abandoning their young in what is described as mass “<a class=link href=https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/starvation-event-shows-wildlife-may-need-human-help-to-survive-20200101-p53o3t.html target=_blank rel=noopener>starvation events</a>.” At least 18 people are dead and grave fears are held about many more.</p><p>All this, and peak fire season is only just beginning.</p><p>As I write, a state of emergency has been declared in New South Wales and a state of disaster in Victoria, mass evacuations are taking place, a humanitarian catastrophe is feared, and towns up and down the east coast are surrounded by fires, all transport and most communication links cut, their fate unknown.</p><p>An email that the retired engineer Ian Mitchell sent to friends on New Year’s Day from the small northern Victoria community of Gipsy Point speaks for countless Australians at this moment of catastrophe:</p><p><em>“All</em></p><p><em>we and most of Gipsy Point houses still here as of now.

While the fires were exploding in mid-December, the leader of the opposition Labor Party went on a tour of coal mining communities expressing his unequivocal support for coal exports. The prime minister, the conservative Scott Morrison, went on <a class=link href=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-20/andrew-probyn-analysis-scott-morrison-hawaii-holiday/11817356 target=_blank rel=noopener>vacation to Hawaii</a>.</p><p>Since 1996 successive conservative Australian governments have successfully <a class=link href=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/01/australia-kyoto-climate-targets-cabinet-papers target=_blank rel=noopener>fought to subvert international agreements on climate change</a> in defense of the country’s fossil fuel industries. Today, Australia is the world’s largest exporter of both <a class=link href=https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2019-08-19/australia-co2-exports-third-highest-worldwide/11420654 target=_blank rel=noopener>coal</a> and <a class=link href=https://www.climatecouncil.org.au/australia-worlds-largest-gas-exporter/ target=_blank rel=noopener>gas</a>. It recently was <a class=link href=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/11/australia-ranked-worst-of-57-countries-on-climate-change-policy target=_blank rel=noopener>ranked 57th out of 57 countries</a> on climate-change action.</p><p>In no small part Mr. Morrison owes his narrow election victory last year to the coal-mining oligarch Clive Palmer, who formed a puppet party to keep the Labor Party — which had been committed to limited but real climate-change action — out of government. Mr. Palmer’s <a class=link href=https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/national/2019/10/25/clive-palmer-election-spend/ target=_blank rel=noopener>advertising budget for the campaign</a> was more than double that of the two major parties combined. Mr. Palmer subsequently announced plans to build <a class=link href=https://www.getup.org.au/campaigns/mining/clive-palmer/clive-palmer-more-information target=_blank rel=noopener>the biggest coal mine in Australia</a>.</p><p>Since Mr. Morrison, an ex-marketing man, was forced to return from his vacation and publicly apologize, he has chosen to spend his time creating feel-good images of himself, posing with cricketers or his family. He is seen far less often at the fires’ front lines, visiting ravaged communities or with survivors. Mr. Morrison has tried to present the fires as catastrophe-as-usual, nothing out of the ordinary.</p><p>This posture seems to be a chilling political calculation: With no effective opposition from a Labor Party reeling from its election loss and with media dominated by Rupert Murdoch — <a class=link href=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/sep/20/very-australian-coup-murdoch-turnbull-political-death-news-corps target=_blank rel=noopener>58 percent of daily newspaper circulation</a> — <a class=link href=https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/national/2020/01/02/michael-pascoe-murdoch-climate/ target=_blank rel=noopener>firmly behind his climate denialism</a>, Mr. Morrison appears to hope that he will prevail as long as he doesn’t acknowledge the magnitude of the disaster engulfing Australia.</p><p>Mr. Morrison made his name as immigration minister, perfecting the cruelty of <a class=link href=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/13/offshore-detention-nauru-immigration-history-human-rights target=_blank rel=noopener>a policy that interns refugees</a> in hellish Pacific-island camps, and seems indifferent to human suffering. Now his government has taken a disturbing authoritarian turn, cracking down on <a class=link href=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2019/nov/12/the-government-is-in-authoritarian-mode-and-now-is-not-the-time-for-complacency target=_blank rel=noopener>unions</a>, civic organizations and <a class=link href=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-48537374 target=_blank rel=noopener>journalists</a>. Under <a class=link href=https://www.theadvocate.com.au/story/6520275/protest-law-will-hold-up-in-court-guy-barnett-says/ target=_blank rel=noopener>legislation</a> pending in Tasmania, and expected to be copied across Australia, environmental protesters now face up to <a class=link href=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-14/bob-brown-and-others-say-new-anti-protest-law-bid-wont-work/11705296 target=_blank rel=noopener>21 years in jail for demonstrating</a>.</p><p>“Australia is a burning nation led by cowards,” <a class=link href="https://10daily.com.au/views/a191119irujf/hugh-riminton-we-are-a-burning-nation-led-by-cowards-20191119?utm_campaign=socialflow&utm_medium=social&utm_content=td-facebook&utm_source=facebook" target=_blank rel=noopener>wrote</a> the leading broadcaster Hugh Riminton, speaking for many.

By <a class=link href=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/26/more-voters-think-australia-not-doing-enough-on-climate-guardian-essential-poll-shows target=_blank rel=noopener>a significant and increasing majority</a>, Australians want action on climate change, and they are now asking questions about the growing gap between the Morrison government’s ideological fantasies and the reality of a dried-out, rapidly heating, burning Australia.</p><p>The situation is eerily reminiscent of the Soviet Union in the 1980s, when the ruling apparatchiks were all-powerful but losing the fundamental, moral legitimacy to govern. In Australia today, a political establishment, grown sclerotic and demented on its own fantasies, is facing a monstrous reality which it has neither the ability nor the will to confront.</p><p>Mr. Morrison may have a massive propaganda machine in the Murdoch press and no opposition, but his moral authority is bleeding away by the hour. On Thursday, after walking away from a pregnant woman asking for help, he was forced to flee the angry, heckling residents of a burned-out town. A local conservative politician described his own leader’s humiliation as “<a class=link href=https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/go-back-to-kirribilli-morrison-heckled-by-angry-residents-in-cobargo-20200102-p53ogb.html target=_blank rel=noopener>the welcome he probably deserved</a>.”</p><p>As Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, once observed, the collapse of the Soviet Union began with the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl in 1986. In the wake of that catastrophe, “<a class=link href=https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/turning-point-at-chernobyl target=_blank rel=noopener>the system as we knew it became untenable</a>,” he wrote in 2006. Could it be that the immense, still-unfolding tragedy of the Australian fires may yet prove to be the Chernobyl of climate crisis?</p><p>Richard Flanagan won the Man Booker Prize for “The Narrow Road to the Deep North” and is the author, most recently, of the novel “First Person.”</p><p><em>The Times is committed to publishing</em> <a class=link href=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html target=_blank rel=noopener><em>a diversity of letters</em></a> <em>to the editor.
