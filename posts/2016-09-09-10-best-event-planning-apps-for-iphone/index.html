Let‚Äôs explore the roundup to get a handy event planner right now!</p><h2 id=best-event-planners-for-iphone-and-android-in-2020>Best Event Planners for iPhone and Android in 2020</h2><p>As always, it‚Äôs better to get the expectations right up front for a more informed buying decision.</p><h3 id=what-else-should-you-expect-from-a-party-planner>What Else Should You Expect from a Party Planner?</h3><p>Both Apple‚Äôs <a class=link href=https://beebom.com/how-hide-unhide-app-store-purchases-iphone-ipad-mac/ target=_blank rel=noopener>App Store</a> and <a class=link href=https://beebom.com/google-play-store-alternatives/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Google‚Äôs Play Store and its alternatives</a>¬†boast a variety of event planning apps. While some are pretty lightweight with simple features like a countdown, to-do list, and guest list, others go well beyond the basic rules. Should you want to have a simple yet efficient event planer, pick out the basic ones. However, if your need warrants a fully-featured party planner with an integrated task manager, note-taking tools, reminders, and calendars, choose the ones that are equipped to take care of all the needs.</p><p>Also, note that we are featuring those apps here which you can use to plan small-scale events. If you are looking for event planning apps to help you manage an event which requires you to host a couple hundred or more attendees, their seating arrangements, ticketing, food, and more, then these apps are not for you. There are professional software that can help you with that. With that out of the way, let‚Äôs get to our list shall we?</p><h2 id=1-planner-pro>1. Planner Pro</h2><p>‚ÄúPlanner Pro‚Äù is a complete event planning app for Android and iOS. Combining events, tasks, and notes in place, the app offers the needed <strong>flexibility to plan events, keep a track of all the related tasks</strong> and also take note of important things. And that too without having to hop from one end to the other. This neat integration offers a more simplified experience.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Planner-Pro.jpg loading=lazy alt="Planner Pro"></p><p>Another front where Planner Pro has an edge over other similar apps is customization. Therefore, you can <strong>customize your events, tasks, and notes</strong> to keep everything in line with your needs. Based on your requirements, you can <strong>display or hide calendars, set different priorities for tasks</strong> as per importance, and add unlimited notes so that you don‚Äôt forget any essential tasks. In a nutshell, Planner Pro is what you need to organize your events smartly and executive the planning the right way.</p><p><em><strong>Price:</strong> Free/in-app purchases available</em></p><p>_<strong>Install:</strong> <a class=link href=https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/planner-pro-daily-calendar/id571588936 target=_blank rel=noopener>iOS</a> and <a class=link href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appxy.planner&hl=en_IN" target=_blank rel=noopener>Android</a>¬†_</p><h2 id=2-anydo>2. Any.do</h2><p>If versatility is what you are after, you would be hard-pressed to find a more powerful event planner than Any.do. The best part about the app is the <strong>seamless collaboration</strong> that plays a vital role in planning a perfect event. You can use this app to work together with your friends and colleagues on shared lists and the assigned tasks. And with the <a class=link href=https://beebom.com/use-remind-me-when-messaging-feature-iphone-ipad-mac/ target=_blank rel=noopener><strong>recurring reminders</strong></a>, it keeps you in tune with everything that‚Äôs lined up for you.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Any-do.jpg loading=lazy alt=Any.do></p><p>Another notable feature of Any.do is the <strong>fully integrated calendar outlook</strong> that allows you to keep a track of events, to-do lists, tasks for the day, week and month. Moreover, the app provides a pretty easy task-list management. For instance, you can add items right from your email inbox and even <strong>attach files from Dropbox and <a class=link href=https://beebom.com/google-drive-tips-and-tricks/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Google Drive</a>.</strong> Even on the personalization front, I find Any.do up to the mark as it offers the desired flexibility to customize events, tasks, calendars, and reminders.</p><p><em><strong>Price:</strong> Free/in-app purchases available</em></p><p><em><strong>Install:</strong> <a class=link href=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/any-do-to-do-list-calendar/id497328576 target=_blank rel=noopener>iOS</a> and <a class=link href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.anydo&hl=en_IN" target=_blank rel=noopener>Android¬†</a></em></p><h2 id=3-asana>3. Asana</h2><p>Asana may not be a typical event planner but it can be immensely helpful in letting you plan an event and take control of all the to-dos. The app is fully-featured and offers a host of tools to make event planning a more simplified experience. Depending on your needs, you can <strong>organize your tasks, add due dates, assignees and all the needed details.</strong> And with the custom reminders, the app keeps you in the loop about what‚Äôs to come. So, there is less chance of any important things slipping out of your mind.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Asana.jpg loading=lazy alt=Asana></p><p>Interface-wise, Asana looks a tad clunky and also demands some learning curve. However, once you have got a good hang of the app, you would love every bit of it. Beyond UI, the app has a <strong>‚ÄúMy tasks‚Äù view</strong> <strong>that makes it quite easy to keep track of all the to-dos.</strong> To offer better collaboration, it allows users to comment on tasks. Besides, you can <strong>directly send a quick reply to your teammates.</strong> Aside from offering a responsive mobile app for iOS and Android, it also offers a fully functional web app. Thus, you can collaborate with your colleagues from any of your devices irrespective of platforms.</p><p>Keep in mind, the app is free for only up to 15 people.

Evernote</h2><p>Whether you want to <strong>plan your event, jot down your ideas or tackle all of your to-dos,</strong> Evernote is the one-stop platform for you. What puts this app ahead of many of its rivals is a wide range of tools that can go a long way in keeping everything organized.

So, you can <strong>search within images and annotate photos to give quick feedback.</strong> As it also works with Apple Watch, you can dictate important points right from your wrist and keep an eye on the updates without having to dig into your smartphone.

To:Day</h2><p>If a simple yet highly effective event planner is what you want, ‚ÄúTo:Day‚Äù would be one of the better options for you. The app has a <strong>neat interface and makes it pretty easy to create an event.</strong> You can add all the tasks to be done before the big day and set reminders to complete the to-dos without any fail. To ensure the most important tasks get more priority, you can add stars to the urgent tasks so that they stay at the forefront.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/To-Day-Event-planner.jpg loading=lazy alt="To Day Event planner"></p><p>It comes with <strong>a countdown so that you can count the remaining days</strong> and be able to go ahead with the plan accordingly.

Event Planner</h2><p>Another app that has caught my eyes is ‚ÄúEvent Planner.‚Äù Unlike many other apps mentioned in this roundup, it‚Äôs <strong>lightweight and keeps everything simple.</strong> Though it‚Äôs not feature-packed, it has got all the basic tools that make event planning hassle-free. Comparatively, it also requires a minimal learning curve which may be a boon for those who aren‚Äôt tech-savvy. The app features <strong>a guest list with invitations and RSVP</strong> so that you can track responses and plan the events accordingly. What‚Äôs more, it also comes with <strong>a super handy budget planner</strong> that can go a long way in keeping a check on unnecessary spending.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Event-planner-.jpg loading=lazy alt="Event planner"></p><p><em><strong>Price:</strong> Free/in-app purchases available</em></p><p>_<strong>Install:</strong> <a class=link href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mmobile.app.event&hl=en_IN" target=_blank rel=noopener>Android</a>¬†_</p><h2 id=7-partymaker>7.

Plan It Out</h2><p>Whether you are planning a house party or getting ready to organize a bachelor party, ‚ÄúPlan It Out‚Äù can be of great help in letting you not just <strong>structure the event but also execute the planning as desired</strong>. Depending on the type of party you are willing to organize, you can create an event poster filling all the required details. It also features a <strong>powerful theme picker</strong> to give an attractive look to the poster. After that, you can create nice-looking invitation cards with Google Maps based location to make tracking pretty easy. Wish to keep your budget tight while planning the event? No problem, there is also an <a class=link href=https://beebom.com/android-finance-management-apps/ target=_blank rel=noopener><strong>expense manager</strong></a> to let you keep a close watch on the various expenses. In a nutshell, Plan It Out is the sort of party planner that most folks would love to use due mainly to some really helpful features.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Plan-It-Out.jpg loading=lazy alt="Plan It Out"></p><p><em><strong>Price:</strong> Free/in-app purchases available</em></p><p>_<strong>Install:</strong> <a class=link href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mmobile.app.event&hl=en_IN" target=_blank rel=noopener>Android</a>¬†_</p><h2 id=9-party--event-planner-lite>9. Party & Event Planner Lite</h2><p>This one is a simple event planner that may appeal to those who are hunting for an easy-to-use app. There are three features that I have found appreciable in this event planning app for iOS. First and foremost, the app <strong>provides a custom task list</strong> based on a type of party. As a result, it becomes a bit straightforward to handle related tasks. The second, it comes with <strong>a readymade expense list</strong> so that it‚Äôs easy to track expenses and also prevent the budget from going overboard. And the third, the party planner app also features <strong>guest categories</strong> and separate drinks calculator to help you manage your guests with ease.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Party-Planner-Lite.jpg loading=lazy alt="Party Planner Lite"></p><p><em><strong>Price:</strong> Free/in-app purchases available</em></p><p><em><strong>Install:</strong> <a class=link href=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/party-event-planner-lite/id500792894 target=_blank rel=noopener>iOS¬†</a></em></p><h2 id=10-google-tasks>10. Google Tasks</h2><p>When there is a race to find a smart planner, overlooking ‚ÄúGoogle Tasks‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt be a wise idea. Being part of G Suite, the app provides a <strong>more intuitive collaboration experience.</strong> Not just that, it also leverages <strong>Google‚Äôs AI</strong> to offer an in-depth insight into your planning. Thus, finding out the areas that need a bit more attention becomes a lot easier. What‚Äôs more, it also offers some <strong>game-changing tips</strong> so that you can perfect your planning.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Google-Tasks.jpg loading=lazy alt="Google Tasks"></p><p>Using important to-dos, you can carry out all the tasks in time.
