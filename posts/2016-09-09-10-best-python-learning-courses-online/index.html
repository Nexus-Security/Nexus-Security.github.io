Advanced Python by Joe Marini</h2><p>The first four courses that we have looked at focuses on beginners. However, what if you are someone who has already completed a beginner course and are looking for something more challenging. Well, if such is the case then you should check out the “Advanced Python” course which we are mentioning here. It is taught by Joe Marini who is a senior developer advocate at Google. As you might know, Python is the official language of Google, and to learn from someone who is already working there is a great chance for you.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/4.-Python-Advanced.jpg loading=lazy alt="4. Python Advanced"></p><p>The course is pretty small coming at just around two and a half hours. However, since it’s an advanced course, unpacking the knowledge packed in those two hours and thirty minutes will take you a ton of time. In this course, <strong>you will learn how to leverage next-level Python features such as object-oriented special class methods, use logging to track performance and user activity,</strong> see how to port code from Python 2 to 3, and make your code more efficient and easier to read and maintain. The course topics include Template strings, Iterators, Transforms, Advanced Python functions, and more.</p><p><em><strong>Course Rating:</strong> There is no course rating system on LinkedIn Learning (Formerly Lynda.com)</em></p><p><em><strong>Difficulty level:</strong> Advanced</em></p><p><em><strong>Subscribe on LinkedIn Learning:</strong> Available as a Part of LinkedIn Premium Membership – <a class=link href=https://www.linkedin.com/learning/advanced-python target=_blank rel=noopener>$29.99/month</a></em></p><h2 id=6-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-using-python>6. Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python</h2><p>One of the best online courses on Python is the “Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python” which is developed by Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a university that needs no introduction. The course is for beginners and that’s why it focuses more on the breadth of the subject rather than on depth. That being said, the course is not to be taken lightly. <strong>The classes and challenging and rigorous and require both time and effort to go through.</strong> The things that you will learn in this course include the Python programming language, some simple algorithms, testing and debugging, an informal introduction to algorithmic complexity,  and more</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/5.-Introduction-to-Computer-Science-and-Programming-Using-Python.jpg loading=lazy alt="5. Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python"></p><p>Before you begin this course, you should know its pre-requisites. Comprehensive knowledge of High school algebra and a reasonable aptitude for mathematics is needed. While you can take this course without any prior coding experience, <strong>students without prior coding experience will find the course to have a steep learning curve</strong> and will require to put in more effort. The best part about this course is that it is free to take if you don’t require the certificate. If you need the certificate which by the way is also eligible for 3 credits you will have to pay for the course.</p><p><em><strong>Course Rating:</strong> One of the top 100 courses of all time at edX</em></p><p><em><strong>Difficulty level:</strong> Beginners to Intermediate</em></p><p><em><strong>Enroll on edX:</strong> <a class=link href=https://www.edx.org/course/6-00-1x-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-using-python-3 target=_blank rel=noopener>Free</a>, $300 for 3 Credits</em></p><h2 id=7-googles-python-class>7. Google’s Python Class</h2><p>If you want to learn Python, what better place to learn it from then Google itself. That being said, Google’s Python Class is not as accessible as other classes mentioned on this list. That’s because the course requires you to have a little bit of programming experience. Also, while there are video lectures, they are quite old and not updated. That means you will have to go through the resources yourself and learn Python. The best part about this course is that <strong>it is focused on solving problems so you will be learning to code in a practical scenario.</strong></p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/7.-Googles-Python-Class.jpg loading=lazy alt="7. Google&rsquo;s Python Class"></p><p>The course starts with the basics of setting up Python on your machine and then moves on to cover topics such as introduction to Python, lists and strings, regular expressions, utilities, dicts and files, and more. The course is more on the technical level and the absence of update video tutorials will hamper the progress of beginners. That’s why you should only go through this course if you have some prior knowledge of coding.</p><p><em><strong>Course Rating:</strong> There is no course rating</em></p><p><em><strong>Difficulty level:</strong> Intermediate to Advanced</em></p><p><em><strong>Get from Google:</strong> <a class=link href=https://developers.google.com/edu/python target=_blank rel=noopener>Free</a></em></p><h2 id=8-learning-python-with-pycharm>8.

Python by Gergoia Tech"></p><p>While this course is focused on Python, <strong>it starts with teaching you the basics of programming</strong> so you have a strong base before you build your Python knowledge. Note that the course is free to watch and learn but you will need to pay the fee if you want a certificate from Georgia Tech. I love this approach as it not only gives people a way to learn Python without spending any money but also gives the option to get credits if they are ready to pay for it. Overall, one of the best beginner online Python learning courses on programming basics that you can find.</p><p><em><strong>Course Rating:</strong> edX doesn’t show any ratings on courses</em></p><p><em><strong>Difficulty level:</strong> Beginners</em></p><p><em><strong>Enroll on edX:</strong> <a class=link href=https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/introduction-to-python-programming target=_blank rel=noopener>Free</a>, $356.40 for Professional Certificate from Georgia Tech</em></p><ol start=10><li></li></ol><p>If you are someone who doesn’t require lectures and best learn from books, then this is the course for you. “Learn Python the Hard Way” is written by Zed Shaw who is famous for his “All Things Hard Way” series. His books are very popular in the beginner developer community. <strong>The book teaches you to learn to code not by learning but by practicing</strong>. Since the premise is based on practice, it will be harder than other courses, but it will make you a more practical programmer so keep that in mind.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/10.-Learn-Python-the-Hard-Way.jpg loading=lazy alt="10. Learn Python the Hard Way"></p><p>The book starts with the basics of Python where you will first learn to install a custom Python environment and then move onto topics such as <strong>organizing and writing code, basic mathematics, variables, strings, program design, debugging,</strong> and more. Despite its name, the book is beginner-friendly and made for beginners. So, if you are an expert programmer, it’s not for you. As I said at the start, if you learn best from books, this is the course you should get.</p><p><em><strong>Course Rating:</strong> 3.8 on Amazon</em></p><p><em><strong>Difficulty level:</strong> Beginners</em></p><p><em><strong>Enroll on edX:</strong> <a class=link href=https://geni.us/AbBL target=_blank rel=noopener>$28.78</a> for Paperback, <a class=link href=https://geni.us/1cm8pBA target=_blank rel=noopener>$19</a> for Kindle edition</em></p><p><strong>SEE ALSO: <a class=link href=https://beebom.com/best-text-editors-for-mac/ target=_blank rel=noopener>10 Best Text Editors for Mac</a></strong></p><h2 id=get-the-best-python-learning-courses-online>Get the Best Python Learning Courses Online</h2><p>That ends our article on the best online Python classes that you can take in 2019 to start your Python learning journey.
