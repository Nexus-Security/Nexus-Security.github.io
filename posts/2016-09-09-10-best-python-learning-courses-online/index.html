The course also gives you basic setup knowledge for learning Python on Linux, macOS, and Windows machines so you don‚Äôt have to buy new hardware to start learning. My favorite thing about this course apart from its study material is its pricing structure. Since this course is on Udemy, you don‚Äôt have to pay a monthly fee to access it. You just buy it once and you have lifetime access to this course.</p><p><em><strong>Course Rating:</strong> 4.5 (Rated by 28,594 students)</em></p><p><em><strong>Difficulty level:</strong> Beginner</em></p><p><em><strong>Buy Course on Udemy:</strong> Starting at <a class=link href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=vwtqSuskR*M&offerid=624447.11264&type=3&subid=0" target=_blank rel=noopener>$10.99</a></em></p><h2 id=3-the-python-bible>3. The Python Bible</h2><p>There‚Äôs a saying that the best way to learn something is to use it. Well, the Python Bible is using the same formulae in its Python teaching course. <strong>In this course, you will learn Python by building 11 easy-to-follow Python 3 projects.</strong> In the course of creating those projects, you will develop a more practical knowledge of Python. You will learn things like Object Oriented Programming (OOP), Logic and Data Structures, Automation using Custom Python Functions, and more. The course is 9 hours long with 74 lectures. There are also 3 downloadable resources and 4 articles.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2.-The-Python-Bible.jpg loading=lazy alt="2. The Python Bible"></p><p>This is a great course for Python learners who already have basic knowledge of the language and want to learn how to use Python to build something. The course says that there is no background of programming required to start this course. And if you are ready to take on a challenge it is true. However, I still feel that it‚Äôs best for people who have a working idea of Python or any other coding language. Again, this course is available on Udemy so it follows the buy once for lifetime access pricing which is just great. This is one of the best Python learning cases that you can get online.</p><p><em><strong>Course Rating:</strong> 4.6 (Rated by 20,145 students)</em></p><p><em><strong>Difficulty level:</strong> Beginner to Intermediate</em></p><p><em><strong>Buy Course on Udemy</strong>: Starting at <a class=link href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=vwtqSuskR*M&offerid=624447.11265&type=3&subid=0" target=_blank rel=noopener>$10.99</a></em></p><h2 id=4-python-for-everybody-specialization>4. Python for Everybody Specialization</h2><p>Python for Everybody Specialization is offered by the University of Michigan. So if you want an online Python learning course developed by a University then this might be a good place to start. All the classes on this course are available online and you don‚Äôt have to attend campus classes. <strong>The course is for four months with 12 hours/week of workload</strong>. While the course starts on a specific date (there are multiple batches so the wait time is not that long), you can decide your pacing as the overall curriculum is quite flexible. Do note that while this is a course provided by the University of Michigan, you will not earn any University credits with this.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/3.-Python-for-Everybody-by-University-of-Michigan.jpg loading=lazy alt="3. Python for Everybody by University of Michigan - Python Learning Courses Online"></p><p>It is for people who want to learn Python but cannot afford or have time to attend classes physically. Talking about the course itself, it is meant for beginners so you don‚Äôt need any prior coding knowledge to start this course. You will start by learning the basics and then move onto other things such as creating your applications for retrieving data, basics of programming computers using Python, basics of the Structured Query Language (SQL) and database design, and more. Overall, this is a comprehensive Python learning online course for beginners.</p><p><em><strong>Course Rating:</strong> 4.8 (Rated by more than 68,000 students)</em></p><p><em><strong>Difficulty level:</strong> Beginner</em></p><p><em><strong>Subscribe on Coursera:</strong> <a class=link href=https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python target=_blank rel=noopener>$49/month</a> (financial aid available)</em></p><h2 id=5-advanced-python-by-joe-marini>5. Advanced Python by Joe Marini</h2><p>The first four courses that we have looked at focuses on beginners. However, what if you are someone who has already completed a beginner course and are looking for something more challenging. Well, if such is the case then you should check out the ‚ÄúAdvanced Python‚Äù course which we are mentioning here. It is taught by Joe Marini who is a senior developer advocate at Google. As you might know, Python is the official language of Google, and to learn from someone who is already working there is a great chance for you.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/4.-Python-Advanced.jpg loading=lazy alt="4. Python Advanced"></p><p>The course is pretty small coming at just around two and a half hours. However, since it‚Äôs an advanced course, unpacking the knowledge packed in those two hours and thirty minutes will take you a ton of time. In this course, <strong>you will learn how to leverage next-level Python features such as object-oriented special class methods, use logging to track performance and user activity,</strong> see how to port code from Python 2 to 3, and make your code more efficient and easier to read and maintain. The course topics include Template strings, Iterators, Transforms, Advanced Python functions, and more.</p><p><em><strong>Course Rating:</strong> There is no course rating system on LinkedIn Learning (Formerly Lynda.com)</em></p><p><em><strong>Difficulty level:</strong> Advanced</em></p><p><em><strong>Subscribe on LinkedIn Learning:</strong> Available as a Part of LinkedIn Premium Membership ‚Äì <a class=link href=https://www.linkedin.com/learning/advanced-python target=_blank rel=noopener>$29.99/month</a></em></p><h2 id=6-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-using-python>6. Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python</h2><p>One of the best online courses on Python is the ‚ÄúIntroduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python‚Äù which is developed by Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a university that needs no introduction. The course is for beginners and that‚Äôs why it focuses more on the breadth of the subject rather than on depth. That being said, the course is not to be taken lightly. <strong>The classes and challenging and rigorous and require both time and effort to go through.</strong> The things that you will learn in this course include the Python programming language, some simple algorithms, testing and debugging, an informal introduction to algorithmic complexity, ¬†and more</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/5.-Introduction-to-Computer-Science-and-Programming-Using-Python.jpg loading=lazy alt="5. Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python"></p><p>Before you begin this course, you should know its pre-requisites. Comprehensive knowledge of High school algebra and a reasonable aptitude for mathematics is needed. While you can take this course without any prior coding experience, <strong>students without prior coding experience will find the course to have a steep learning curve</strong> and will require to put in more effort. The best part about this course is that it is free to take if you don‚Äôt require the certificate. If you need the certificate which by the way is also eligible for 3 credits you will have to pay for the course.</p><p><em><strong>Course Rating:</strong> One of the top 100 courses of all time at edX</em></p><p><em><strong>Difficulty level:</strong> Beginners to Intermediate</em></p><p><em><strong>Enroll on edX:</strong> <a class=link href=https://www.edx.org/course/6-00-1x-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-using-python-3 target=_blank rel=noopener>Free</a>, $300 for 3 Credits</em></p><h2 id=7-googles-python-class>7. Google‚Äôs Python Class</h2><p>If you want to learn Python, what better place to learn it from then Google itself. That being said, Google‚Äôs Python Class is not as accessible as other classes mentioned on this list. That‚Äôs because the course requires you to have a little bit of programming experience. Also, while there are video lectures, they are quite old and not updated. That means you will have to go through the resources yourself and learn Python. The best part about this course is that <strong>it is focused on solving problems so you will be learning to code in a practical scenario.</strong></p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/7.-Googles-Python-Class.jpg loading=lazy alt="7. Google&rsquo;s Python Class"></p><p>The course starts with the basics of setting up Python on your machine and then moves on to cover topics such as introduction to Python, lists and strings, regular expressions, utilities, dicts and files, and more. The course is more on the technical level and the absence of update video tutorials will hamper the progress of beginners. That‚Äôs why you should only go through this course if you have some prior knowledge of coding.</p><p><em><strong>Course Rating:</strong> There is no course rating</em></p><p><em><strong>Difficulty level:</strong> Intermediate to Advanced</em></p><p><em><strong>Get from Google:</strong> <a class=link href=https://developers.google.com/edu/python target=_blank rel=noopener>Free</a></em></p><h2 id=8-learning-python-with-pycharm>8. Learning Python with PyCharm</h2><p>Another good Beginner level course for learning Python is the ‚ÄúLearning Python with PyCharm‚Äù course on LinkedIn Learning. Instructed by Bruce Van Horn who is a lead software developer at Visual Storage Intelligence, the course gives you a step-by-step guide to Python. You start with learning to set up your development environment and then explore PyCharm‚Äôs first-rate text editing tools.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/8.-Learning-Python-with-PyCharm.jpg loading=lazy alt="8. Learning Python with PyCharm"></p><p>For the beginners, PyCharm is an integrated development environment (IDE) used in computer programming, specifically for the Python language. It is where you will write your code. The course includes topics such as installing PyCharm, adding functions, code debugging, creating databases, and more. Finally, you will also learn how to integrate Python with web projects that include HTML and JavaScript.</p><p><em><strong>Course Rating:</strong> There is no course rating system on LinkedIn Learning (Formerly Lynda.com)</em></p><p><em><strong>Difficulty level:</strong> Beginner</em></p><p><em><strong>Subscribe on LinkedIn Learning:</strong> Available as a Part of LinkedIn Premium Membership ‚Äì <a class=link href=https://www.lynda.com/Python-tutorials/Learning-Python-PyCharm/590828-2.html target=_blank rel=noopener>$29.99/month</a></em></p><h2 id=9-introduction-to-python-programming-by-georgia-tech>9. Introduction to Python Programming by Georgia Tech</h2><p>If you are looking for a complete Python programming course just the way it‚Äôs taught in universities, then you should check out this course on Python by Georgia Tech. <strong>It‚Äôs a vast course which requires 180-200 hours of work on your part.</strong> This time includes all the lectures that you will watch along with the expected time it will take you to solve the problems and assignments given in the course. The best part about this course is that you don‚Äôt require any computer science background. That means anyone can start learning Python with this course.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/9.-Python-by-Gergoia-Tech-1024x458.jpg loading=lazy alt="9. Python by Gergoia Tech"></p><p>While this course is focused on Python, <strong>it starts with teaching you the basics of programming</strong> so you have a strong base before you build your Python knowledge. Note that the course is free to watch and learn but you will need to pay the fee if you want a certificate from Georgia Tech. I love this approach as it not only gives people a way to learn Python without spending any money but also gives the option to get credits if they are ready to pay for it. Overall, one of the best beginner online Python learning courses on programming basics that you can find.</p><p><em><strong>Course Rating:</strong> edX doesn‚Äôt show any ratings on courses</em></p><p><em><strong>Difficulty level:</strong> Beginners</em></p><p><em><strong>Enroll on edX:</strong> <a class=link href=https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/introduction-to-python-programming target=_blank rel=noopener>Free</a>, $356.40 for Professional Certificate from Georgia Tech</em></p><ol start=10><li></li></ol><p>If you are someone who doesn‚Äôt require lectures and best learn from books, then this is the course for you. ‚ÄúLearn Python the Hard Way‚Äù is written by Zed Shaw who is famous for his ‚ÄúAll Things Hard Way‚Äù series. His books are very popular in the beginner developer community. <strong>The book teaches you to learn to code not by learning but by practicing</strong>. Since the premise is based on practice, it will be harder than other courses, but it will make you a more practical programmer so keep that in mind.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/10.-Learn-Python-the-Hard-Way.jpg loading=lazy alt="10.
