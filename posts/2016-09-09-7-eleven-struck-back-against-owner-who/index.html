gone. So are the juice bottles, which Mitoshi Matsumoto priced to sell early. Most of his store‚Äôs shelves stand empty, but he has kept some cigarette cartons and bottles of alcohol in the hope that his long-running battle with the 7-Eleven convenience store chain will end in his favor.</p><p>The company that controls the 7-Eleven chain, Seven & I Holdings, terminated Mr. Matsumoto‚Äôs franchise last week after he decided to close his store on New Year‚Äôs Day, and it has stopped supplying him.</p><p>It was the latest battle between Mr. Matsumoto and one of Japan‚Äôs best-known companies over harsh working conditions in the Japanese convenience store industry, which demands that stores stay open seven days a week, 24 hours a day, for all 365 days in a year.</p><p>Mr. Matsumoto remains in business, but just barely. The screen on the A.T.M. flashes, ‚ÄúNot in operation.‚Äù His two full-time employees are ready to jump to new jobs once he finally closes, and his seven part-time employees no longer show up.</p><p>Still, he plans to stay open as long as he can.</p><p>‚ÄúI want to stay in business for the sake of myself and other owners throughout the country,‚Äù said Mr. Matsumoto, 57, who says he plans to continue his fight in a local court.</p><p>A spokesman for Seven & I, Katsuhiko Shimizu, said the company terminated Mr. Matsumoto‚Äôs contract last Tuesday. He denied that the termination was tied to Mr. Matsumoto‚Äôs plan to close for a day, and instead cited numerous customer complaints about the store and Mr. Matsumoto‚Äôs disparaging remarks about the company on social media.</p><p>Mr. Matsumoto‚Äôs fight with 7-Eleven has made him famous in Japan, a country that has long struggled with a strenuous and sometimes deadly work culture.</p><p>Government figures show overwork was blamed for 246 claims related to hospitalization or death in 2018. The retail industry was one of the biggest sources, officials show. Another 568 workers took their own lives over job-related exhaustion. The phenomenon is so common that Japan has coined a term for it, ‚Äúkaroshi.‚Äù</p><p>Overwork has become an even bigger issue as the Japanese population ages and shrinks. Though the country‚Äôs economic growth has been weak for years, the labor market has tightened considerably as more workers slip into retirement and fewer young workers take their place. While Japan is rethinking its tough immigration laws, the rules still generally keep people from moving to the country to fill in the gap.</p><p>Those strains are particularly evident in the convenience store industry. Japan‚Äôs chains have greatly expanded in recent years in an effort to capture market share at one another‚Äôs expense.</p><p>While the expenses for the chains were minimal, the expansion took a toll on the franchisees who operate the vast majority of Japan‚Äôs more than 55,000 convenience stores. Unable to find dependable workers, many owners increasingly worked themselves.</p><p>‚ÄúUnder the current situation, the company can have it both ways,‚Äù said Naoki Tsuchiya, a professor at Musashi University in Tokyo and an expert on labor issues in the industry, who called Mr. Matsumoto ‚Äúa significant figure‚Äù in the nationwide discussion over convenience stores. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt have to take risks, but the owners have to take them.‚Äù</p><p>Mr. Matsumoto first drew attention a year ago. Under pressure to find workers and unable to take a day off himself, he decided to close his store before midnight. When 7-Eleven threatened his business, he contacted local reporters.</p><p>‚ÄúIn the last seven years, I managed to take only three trips with my wife,‚Äù he said over the weekend. ‚ÄúEven back then, I was preoccupied with store operations, worrying about sudden cancellation by part-time workers. I had to hold a mobile phone while I soaked in a spa.‚Äù</p><p>The clash drew renewed attention last month when Mr. Matsumoto declared his intention to close his store on New Year‚Äôs Day, Japan‚Äôs most important holiday. Days later, 7-Eleven threatened to close his store.</p><p>When Mr. Matsumoto reopened on Jan. 2, the threat appeared to have been carried out. The company‚Äôs vast and super-efficient logistics system had stopped sending fresh supplies. The sales terminal where employees ring up goods is still online, but little else appears to be connected to the 7-Eleven apparatus that runs nearly 40 percent of Japan‚Äôs convenience stores.</p><p>Mr. Matsumoto says he still has business. Supportive customers have shown up to shop among his remaining inventory, which includes snacks, instant noodles, stationery items, detergents and cosmetics.</p><p>One of them, Hiroshi Nakayama, a 45-year-old electrical equipment wholesaler, had long watched the fight between Mr. Matsumoto and 7-Eleven and went to the store after his son‚Äôs soccer game to check in. The whole fight could have been avoided, he said.</p><p>‚ÄúThere must have been other solutions to fix the bad relationship with the company,‚Äù said Mr. Nakayama, who turned up on Saturday after Mr. Matsumoto, running on a skeleton staff, had closed for the night. ‚ÄúThey could have discussed it more. It‚Äôs both sides‚Äô fault.‚Äù</p><p>Mr. Matsumoto said another store owner, from the city of Kyoto, had come to visit to express support, but he declined to provide a name.</p><p>Despite his troubles with the company, Mr. Matsumoto said he hoped a legal fight would restore his franchise. He said that 7-Eleven had offered to pay for his remaining inventory ‚Äî owners are responsible for buying their own products from the company at wholesale prices ‚Äî but that he had refused. He wants Japan‚Äôs convenience store industry to change instead.</p><p>‚ÄúIf I win the case, I hope more will follow and raise their voices,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf I lose, many will get depressed and more afraid of 7-Eleven.‚Äù</p><p>That is why, he said, he plans to fight to the bitter end.</p><p>‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter if I win or lose,‚Äù Mr. Matsumoto said. ‚ÄúI just want to disclose everything in my case. I believe the justice will be given.‚Äù</p><p>from Hacker News <a class=link href=https://ift.tt/2MYOcgE target=_blank rel=noopener>https://ift.tt/2MYOcgE</a></p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-copyright><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="icon icon-tabler icon-tabler-copyright" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="2" stroke="currentcolor" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path stroke="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="9"/><path d="M14.5 9a3.5 4 0 100 6"/></svg><span>Licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</span></section></footer></article><footer class=site-footer><section class=copyright>&copy;
