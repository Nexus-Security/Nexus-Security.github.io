They must adhere to specific institutional processes, which, in many cases, are state and federal requirements. But they must also use a certain amount of pragmatism since no two investigations are exactly alike.</p><h1 id=what-is-infosec>What is InfoSec?!</h1><p><a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security target=_blank rel=noopener>Information Security, or InfoSec</a>, can be traced back to at least the 1970s when you look at the basis for many of the different security methods used today. Just like its rich history, the current state of INFOSEC is constantly evolving. Specific technologies and practices used in days past do not provide much traction against modern issues, such as injection techniques, man-in-the-middle threats, or wireless network security and go on. However, the basic principles have evolved and become stronger in the latest iteration. These principles are probably already ingrained in your mind, defense in depth, multi-factor authentication, and complete (as well as useful) audit trails. People who work in InfoSec all start off with these same principles, but usually diverge into a specific path as a career.</p><p><img src=https://blogpirate.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1024px-CIAJMK1209.png loading=lazy></p><p>Information Security Attributes: or qualities, i.e., Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA).</p><p>So what is InfoSec anyway? Lots of different aspects of overall Information Technology come together along with business strategies to form¬†<a class=link href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23InfoSec" target=_blank rel=noopener>InfoSec</a>. I‚Äôll put forward one definition of it, and everyone is welcome to disagree. InfoSec is the process that you follow to ensure the¬†<em>Confidentiality</em>,¬†<em>Integrity</em>¬†and¬†<em>Availability</em>¬†(CIA) of information. Confidentiality is basically making sure that only the approved person or people have access to the data. Integrity is the assurance that the data stored and retrieved can be verified to be true, that no corruption or unauthorized change has taken place. Availability is defined as the state of the data being accessible when needed. Taken at that level, InfoSec covers a tremendous space. This involves the desktop support technician that makes sure that a new workstation is current on patch levels, the network engineer that keeps exterior network traffic from affecting operations, the systems administrator locking down any and all network resources, the engineers and testers that verify and validate existing technical security controls, as well as the analyst that works to create policies and procedures so that repeatable processes are followed.</p><p>No one person is more important than the other, and without a of the parts working together, there is no complete program. Without InfoSec, data is simply not safe. There are many sources, both internal and external, that threaten the CIA of data. Many people go into InfoSec without understanding the organic nature of how it should work. It does not stop at the door to the data center or the telephone at the Help Desk. InfoSec can be broken down into three sets of controls: managerial, operational, and technical. At the highest level, any security control implemented should fall into one of these three sets. Managerial controls focus on the management level and designate individuals who are capable of leading an organization as well as how.</p><p>In short. Information security or InfoSec means protecting information (data) and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.</p><p>In past decades,¬†<a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certified_Ethical_Hacker target=_blank rel=noopener>ethical hacking</a>¬†and penetration testing were performed by only a few security experts. Now almost anyone can report security incidents. Ethical hacking tools allow you to scan, search and find the flaws and vulnerabilities within any company to help make their systems and applications more secure.</p><p>Here is a compilation of a few tools that we need to be aware of. The power, the performance and the capabilities of these tools are limited only to the creativity of the attacker. Let‚Äôs dig in to the list.</p><h2 id=metasploit>Metasploit</h2><p><a class=link href=https://www.metasploit.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Metasploit</a>¬†is extremely powerful and versatile, from scanning to exploiting, to creating your own payloads it has everything you could possible need for a penetration test or vulnerability analysis of an environment. The pro version of metasploit is more user-friendly to people who do not prefer to use the command-line, which has everything in an easy to find area to execute. The command-line version is just as powerful, it just requires that you are familiar with the various switches and options with metasploit.</p><ul><li>Penetration Testing</li><li>Ethical Hacking</li><li>Security Auditing</li><li>Pre-installed on Kali Linux</li><li>Find, Exploit, and Validate vulnerabilities</li><li>Open source Metasploit Framework</li><li>Commercial support available via Metasploit Pro</li></ul><h2 id=wapiti>Wapiti</h2><p><a class=link href=http://wapiti.sourceforge.net/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Wapiti</a>¬†has the capacity to perform black box scans without studying the source code,it crawls the pages of the deployed webapp and looks for vulnerabilities.This is a very interesting feature and i like this the best about wapiti.</p><p>While it‚Äôs not the most popular tool in this field, it does a good job of finding security flaws in many web applications.</p><p>Using Wapiti can help you to discover security holes including:</p><ul><li>XSS attacks</li><li>SQL injections</li><li>XPath injections</li><li>XXE injections</li><li>CRLF injections</li><li>Server side request forgery</li></ul><p>Other features include:</p><ul><li>Runs in verbose mode</li><li>Ability to pause and resume scans.</li><li>Highlights vulnerabilities found inside the terminal</li><li>Generates reports and export into HTML, XML, JSON and TXT</li><li>Activates and deactivates multiple attack modules</li><li>Removes parameters from certain URLs</li><li>Excludes URLs during an attack</li><li>Bypasses SSL certificate verification</li><li>URL extractor from javascript</li><li>Timeout configuration for large scans</li><li>Sets custom user-agent and HTTP headers</li></ul><h2 id=wireshark>Wireshark</h2><p><a class=link href=https://www.wireshark.org/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Wireshark</a>¬†is straightforward to use and to capture network traffic.

Even though the names remain the same, the ways they operate often change radically as new defences or mechanisms for attacking those defences come into play. So staying current on the top tools in the cyber-security industry is a never-ending challenge.</p><p>Some tools are highly specialized, or even custom-made, and you might find yourself working primarily with a single software package that is optimized for your role. But rolling your own is a laborious process and there are plenty of off-the-shelf products that can be extremely effective‚Ä¶ if you know how to use them.</p><p>The good news is that many of the best tools are free, both as in speech and as in beer. Open source, freely-distributed security tools have always been among the most important in the industry because their collaborative development both outpaces private sector efforts and because the ability to view and understand how the code operates prevents any nefarious purposes from being baked in.</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-copyright><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="icon icon-tabler icon-tabler-copyright" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="2" stroke="currentcolor" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path stroke="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="9"/><path d="M14.5 9a3.5 4 0 100 6"/></svg><span>Licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</span></section></footer></article><footer class=site-footer><section class=copyright>&copy;
