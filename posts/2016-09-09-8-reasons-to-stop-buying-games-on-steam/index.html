So if you‚Äôre a PC gamer it‚Äôs likely that you own games on Steam. But is it really the best way to buy games? Here are some reasons to stop buying games on Steam.</p><h2 id=1-drm-means-you-dont-own-anything>1. DRM Means You Don‚Äôt Own Anything</h2><p>Steam is a form of digital rights management (DRM), which is a method to protect against piracy. When you launch a game, Steam launches with it, ensuring you can benefit from platform features like achievements, cloud saves, and trading cards (<a class=link href=//www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-get-steam-trading-cards/>how to get Steam trading cards</a>).</p><p>The good thing is that the DRM is optional. Developers can disable it and allow their games to launch without Steam running. However, many don‚Äôt.</p><p>For those that don‚Äôt, that game is tied to your Steam account. So, if Steam closes down or your account gets banned, you‚Äôll no longer have access to the games you bought. Which means that, in essence, you are merely renting a license to a game.</p><h2 id=2-you-cant-resell-your-steam-games>2. You Can‚Äôt Resell Your Steam Games</h2><p>Image Credit: JJBers/<a class=link href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/148374920@N02/25268940147/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Flickr</a></p><p>Once you buy a game on Steam, there‚Äôs no way to sell it on. While you can get a refund under certain conditions, you can‚Äôt list it on any marketplace. The game is tied to your account.</p><p>That‚Äôs different to a game that you buy physically, for example (providing you don‚Äôt have to redeem a key to activate the game.) They can easily be sold on eBay, traded in, or donated to a thrift store.</p><p>However, a French court ruled that Steam users do have a right to resell their games. That‚Äôs something that hasn‚Äôt come in to practice yet as Valve is appealing the decision.</p><h2 id=3-steam-games-rarely-come-with-bonus-goodies>3. Steam Games Rarely Come With Bonus Goodies</h2><p>Playing the game you buy is of course the main draw, but it‚Äôs always nice to receive some extras for free. Sadly, you rarely get any bonus goodies when you buy a game on Steam.</p><p>If you buy direct through the developer, or on another storefront like GOG, you often get downloadable treats like art books, soundtracks, wallpapers, and more.</p><p>It harks back to the days when you would get physical bonuses with your games, like a cloth map or figurine.</p><h2 id=4-valve-takes-a-huge-cut-from-developers>4. Valve Takes a Huge Cut From Developers</h2><p>Image Credit: Marco Verch/<a class=link href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/30478819@N08/48751490938/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Flickr</a></p><p>Making video games is difficult. Turning a profit on them? That‚Äôs even tougher. As standard, Valve takes a 30 percent cut of the revenue of all Steam purchases. That percentage reduces on a sliding scale when certain revenue targets are reached, but most developers will never get to that point.</p><p>Some developers don‚Äôt think Valve deserve such a large chunk of the pie, but Steam‚Äôs ubiquity makes it hard to argue. It‚Äôs where many consumers automatically go to buy games, so not having a game listed on Steam is risky.</p><p>If you want to support a developer then you should stop buying games on Steam. Instead, your best approach is to buy games directly from developers, if possible. Alternatively, the Epic Store only takes a 12 percent cut, while Humble Bundle lets you choose how much of the purchase price goes to the developer.</p><h2 id=5-steam-isnt-always-the-cheapest-option>5. Steam Isn‚Äôt Always the Cheapest Option</h2><p>Steam always has sales. There are daily sales and also the big seasonal ones around events like Halloween and Christmas. But even then it‚Äôs not necessarily the cheapest place to buy games.</p><p>Gaming is an expensive hobby at the best of times, so there‚Äôs no point spending more than you need to. Especially when the end product is exactly the same wherever you buy it (things like pre-order bonuses aside.)</p><p>Check out our recommendations for <a class=link href=//www.makeuseof.com/tag/top-5-sites-video-game-deals-bargains/>the best sites for video game deals</a>. Some websites even provide your purchase as a Steam code, meaning there‚Äôs literally no difference in the product except the price.</p><h2 id=6-you-are-tied-into-the-steam-ecosystem>6. You Are Tied Into the Steam Ecosystem</h2><p>Some people like owning all of their games on Steam and being tied into the Steam ecosystem. Perhaps it‚Äôs the collector in them coming out, or it‚Äôs just what all of their friends use.</p><p>The problem with this comes when you want to buy something outside of Steam.</p><p>Let‚Äôs say you buy a game through Steam and the developer later releases DLC. You have no choice but to buy that DLC through Steam, even if it‚Äôs cheaper elsewhere, because there‚Äôs no way to link the two purchases together otherwise.</p><h2 id=7-you-dont-get-a-physical-box>7. You Don‚Äôt Get a Physical Box</h2><p>Image Credit: Sergey Galyonkin/<a class=link href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/22974618@N00/4379801486/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Flickr</a></p><p>Video games used to come in big cardboard boxes, with great artwork perfect for display. That changed with the introduction of CDs and DVDs, but there‚Äôs still something satisfying about seeing a shelf lined with your favorite games.</p><p>While it‚Äôs much quicker to browse and search your collection on Steam, it‚Äôs not quite the same. Visitors to your home aren‚Äôt going to strike up a conversation about your Steam library like they might if they saw a line of physical game boxes.</p><p>There was something special about poring over a game‚Äôs manual on your way home from the shop too. That‚Äôs an experience lost, although, to be frank, it does cut down on paper and plastic waste.</p><h2 id=8-the-steam-store-is-full-of-trash>8. The Steam Store Is Full of Trash</h2><p>Steam is home to tens of thousands of games. The number of games on the store has skyrocketed in recent years, in part thanks to Valve‚Äôs lack of curation.</p><p>Unlike when you walk into your local store, where the stock has been carefully chosen, the Steam store plays host to everything. While it‚Äôs good that the barrier to entry is low, it means there‚Äôs a lot of trash and low-effort games to wade through.</p><p>For instance, 4,000 of the games on the store are classed as Early Access, which means development isn‚Äôt finished. And there‚Äôs no guarantee that these games will ever be properly finished.</p><p>Why should it be on the consumer to separate the wheat from the chaff?</p><h2 id=the-best-pc-game-launchers>The Best PC Game Launchers</h2><p>Despite all of these reasons to stop buying games on Steam, it definitely still has its place. The problem is, Steam has such a hold on the market that it‚Äôs difficult for competitors to enter and shake things up.</p><p>If you own lots of games across different platforms and want to organize them, you need a game launcher.
