It will be more interesting to consider what the problems before me were, and why I was unlikely to solve them. I should like to do this, though it may involve us a little in fiction technicalities &mldr;‚Äù</p><p>So said E. M. Forster, addressing an audience at the Aldeburgh Festival of 1951. He had been reading part of an unfinished novel called Arctic Summer. At the end of the reading, he went on to explain why he had not finished the novel, which led him to mention what he called ‚Äúfiction technicalities.‚Äù</p><p>Following up on Mr. Forster‚Äôs Aldeburgh remarks, we have tried to record his views on such matters as he gave them in an interview at King‚Äôs College, Cambridge, on the evening of June 20, 1952.</p><p>A spacious and high-ceilinged room, furnished in the Edwardian taste. One‚Äôs attention is caught by a massive carved wooden mantelpiece of elaborate structure holding blue china in its niches. Large, gilt-framed portrait-drawings on the walls (his Thornton ancestors and others), a Turner by his great-uncle, and some modern pictures. Books of all sorts, handsome and otherwise, in English and French; armchairs decked in little shawls; a piano, a solitaire board, and the box of a zoetrope; profusion of opened letters; slippers neatly arranged in wastepaper basket.</p><p>In reading what follows, the reader must imagine Mr. Forster‚Äôs manner, which though of extreme amenity is a firm one: precise, yet nonetheless elusive, administering a series of tiny surprises. He makes a perpetual slight displacement of the expected emphasis. His habit was to answer our questions by brief statements, followed by decorative asides, often of great interest, but very difficult to reproduce.</p><p>INTERVIEWER</p><p>To begin with, may we ask you again, why did you never finish Arctic Summer?</p><p>E. M. FORSTER</p><p>I have really answered this question in the foreword I wrote for the reading. The crucial passage was this:</p><p>‚Äú &mldr; whether these problems are solved or not, there remains a still graver one. What is going to happen? I had got my antithesis all right, the antithesis between the civilized man, who hopes for an arctic summer in which there is time to get things done, and the heroic man. But I had not settled what is going to happen, and that is why the novel remains a fragment. The novelist should, I think, always settle when he starts what is going to happen, what his major event is to be. He may alter this event as he approaches it, indeed he probably will, indeed he probably had better, or the novel becomes tied up and tight. But the sense of a solid mass ahead, a mountain round or over or through which [<em>he interposed</em>, ‚Äúin this case it would be <em>through</em>‚Äù] the story must somehow go, is most valuable and, for the novels I‚Äôve tried to write, essential.‚Äù</p><p>INTERVIEWER</p><p>How much is involved in this ‚Äúsolid mass‚Äù? Does it mean that all the important steps in the plot must also be present in the original conception?</p><p>FORSTER</p><p>Certainly not all the steps. But there must be something, some major object towards which one is to approach. When I began <em>A Passage to India</em> I knew that something important happened in the Marabar Caves, and that it would have a central place in the novel‚Äîbut I didn‚Äôt know what it would be.</p><p>INTERVIEWER</p><p>But if you didn‚Äôt know what was going to happen to the characters in either instance, why was the case of <em>A Passage to India</em> so different from that of Arctic Summer? In both cases you had your antithesis.</p><p>FORSTER</p><p>The atmosphere of Arctic Summer did not approach the density of what I had in <em>A Passage to India</em>. Let me see how to explain. The Marabar Caves represented an area in which concentration can take place. A cavity. [<em>We noticed that he always spoke of the caves quite literally‚Äîas for instance when he interrupted himself earlier to say that the characters had to pass</em> ‚Äúthrough‚Äù <em>them</em>.] They were something to focus everything up; they were to engender an event like an egg. What I had in Arctic Summer was thinner, a background and color only.</p><p>INTERVIEWER</p><p>You spoke of antitheses in your novels. Do you regard these as essential to any novel you might write?</p><p>FORSTER</p><p>Let me think &mldr; There was one in <em>Howards End</em>. Perhaps a rather subtler one in <em>The Longest Journey</em>.</p><p>INTERVIEWER</p><p>Would you agree that all your novels not only deal with some dilemma but are intended to be both true and useful in regard to it‚Äîso that if you felt a certain dilemma was too extreme, its incompatibles too impossible to reconcile, you wouldn‚Äôt write about it?</p><p>FORSTER</p><p>True and lovable would be my antithesis. I don‚Äôt think useful comes into it. I‚Äôm not sure that I would be put off simply because a dilemma that I wanted to treat was insoluble; at least, I don‚Äôt think I should be.</p><p>INTERVIEWER</p><p>While we are on the subject of the planning of novels, has a novel ever taken an unexpected direction?</p><p>FORSTER</p><p>Of course, that wonderful thing, a character running away with you‚Äîwhich happens to everyone‚Äîthat‚Äôs happened to me, I‚Äôm afraid.</p><p>INTERVIEWER</p><p>Can you describe any technical problem that especially bothered you in one of the published novels?</p><p>FORSTER</p><p>I had trouble with the junction of Rickie and Stephen. [<em>The hero of</em> The Longest Journey <em>and his half-brother.</em>] How to make them intimate, I mean. I fumbled about a good deal. It is all right once they are together &mldr; I didn‚Äôt know how to get Helen to Howards End. That part is all contrived. There are too many letters. And again, it is all right once she is there. But ends always give me trouble.</p><p>INTERVIEWER</p><p>Why is that?</p><p>FORSTER</p><p>It is partly what I was talking about a moment ago. Characters run away with you, and so won‚Äôt fit on to what is coming.</p><p>INTERVIEWER</p><p>Another question of detail. What was the exact function of the long description of the Hindu festival in <em>A Passage to India</em>?</p><p>FORSTER</p><p>It was architecturally necessary. I needed a lump‚Äîor a Hindu temple if you like‚Äîa mountain standing up. It is well-placed, and it gathers up some strings. But there ought to be more after it. The lump sticks out a little too much.</p><p>INTERVIEWER</p><p>To leave technical questions for a moment, have you ever described any type of situation of which you have had no personal knowledge?</p><p>FORSTER</p><p>The home life of Leonard and Jacky in <em>Howards End</em> is one case. I knew nothing about that. I believe I brought it off.</p><p>INTERVIEWER</p><p>How far removed in time do you have to be from an experience in order to describe it?</p><p>FORSTER</p><p>Place is more important than time in this matter. Let me tell you a little more about <em>A Passage to India</em>. I had a great deal of difficulty with the novel and thought I would never finish it. I began it in 1912, and then came the war. I took it with me when I returned to India in 1921 but found what I had written wasn‚Äôt India at all. It was like sticking a photograph on a picture. However, I couldn‚Äôt <em>write</em> it when I was in India. When I got away, I could get on with it.</p><p>INTERVIEWER</p><p>Some critics have objected to your way of handling incidents of violence. Do you agree with their objections?</p><p>FORSTER</p><p>I think I solved the problem satisfactorily in <em>Where Angels Fear to Tread</em>. In other cases, I don‚Äôt know. The scene in the Malabar Caves is a good substitute for violence. Which were the incidents you didn‚Äôt like?</p><p>INTERVIEWER</p><p>I have always been worried by the suddenness of Gerald‚Äôs death in <em>The Longest Journey</em>. Why did you treat it in that way?*</p><p>FORSTER</p><p>It had to be passed by. But perhaps it was passed by in the wrong way.</p><p>INTERVIEWER</p><p>I have also never felt comfortable about Leonard Bast‚Äôs seduction of Helen in <em>Howards End</em>. It is such a sudden affair. It seems as though we are not told enough about it for it to be convincing. One might say that it came off allegorically but not realistically.</p><p>FORSTER</p><p>I think you may be right. I did it like that out of a wish to have surprises. It has to be a surprise for Margaret, and this was best done by making it a surprise for the reader, too. Too much may have been sacrificed to this.</p><p>INTERVIEWER</p><p>A more general question. Would you admit to there being any symbolism in your novels? Lionel Trilling rather seems to imply that there is, in his book on you‚Äîsymbolism, that is, as distinct from allegory or parable. ‚ÄúMrs. Moore,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúwill act with a bad temper to Adela, but her actions will somehow have a good echo; and her children will be her further echo &mldr;‚Äù</p><p>FORSTER</p><p>No, I didn‚Äôt think of that. But mightn‚Äôt there be some of it elsewhere? Can you try me with some more examples?</p><p>INTERVIEWER</p><p>The tree at Howards End? [<em>A wych-elm, frequently referred to in the novel.</em>]</p><p>FORSTER</p><p>Yes, that was symbolical; it was the genius of the house.</p><p>INTERVIEWER</p><p>What was the significance of Mrs. Wilcox‚Äôs influence on the other characters after her death?</p><p>FORSTER</p><p>I was interested in the imaginative effect of someone alive, but in a different way from other characters‚Äîliving in other lives.</p><p>INTERVIEWER</p><p>Were you influenced by Samuel Butler in this? I mean, by his theories of vicarious immortality?</p><p>FORSTER</p><p>No. I think I have a more poetical mind than Butler‚Äôs.</p><p>INTERVIEWER</p><p>Now, can we ask you a few questions about the immediate business of writing? Do you keep a notebook?</p><p>FORSTER</p><p>No, I should feel it improper.</p><p>INTERVIEWER</p><p>But you would refer to diaries and letters?</p><p>FORSTER</p><p>Yes, that‚Äôs different.</p><p>INTERVIEWER</p><p>When you go, say, to the circus, would you ever feel, How nice it would be to put that in a novel?</p><p>FORSTER</p><p>No, I should feel it improper. I never say, That might be useful. I don‚Äôt think it is right for an author to do so. However, I have been inspired on the spot. ‚ÄúThe Story of a Panic‚Äù is the simplest example; ‚ÄúThe Road from Colonus‚Äù is another. Sense of a place also inspired me to write a short story called ‚ÄúThe Rock,‚Äù but the inspiration was poor in quality, and the editors wouldn‚Äôt take the story. But I have talked about this in the introduction to my short stories.</p><p>INTERVIEWER</p><p>Do you prefigure a shape to your novels?</p><p>FORSTER</p><p>No, I am too unvisual to do so. [<em>We found this surprising in view of his explanation of the Hindu festival scene</em>.]</p><p>INTERVIEWER</p><p>Does this come out in any other way?</p><p>FORSTER</p><p>I find it difficult to recognize people when I meet them, though I remember about them. I remember their voices.</p><p>INTERVIEWER</p><p>Do you have any Wagnerian leitmotif system to help you keep so many themes going at the same time?</p><p>FORSTER</p><p>Yes, in a way, and I‚Äôm certainly interested in music and musical methods. Though I shouldn‚Äôt call it a system.</p><p>INTERVIEWER</p><p>Do you write every day, or only under inspiration?</p><p>FORSTER</p><p>The latter. But the act of writing inspires me. It is a nice feeling &mldr; Of course, I had a very literary childhood. I was the author of a number of works between the ages of six and ten. There were ‚ÄúEarrings through the Keyhole‚Äù and ‚ÄúScuffles in a Wardrobe.‚Äù</p><p>INTERVIEWER</p><p>Which of your novels came first to your mind?</p><p>FORSTER</p><p>Half of <em>A Room with a View</em>. I got that far, and then there must have been a hitch.</p><p>INTERVIEWER</p><p>Did you ever attempt a novel of an entirely different sort from the ones you have published?</p><p>FORSTER</p><p>For some time I had the idea of an historical novel. The setting was to have been a Renaissance one. Reading <em>Tha√Øs</em> [<em>by Anatole France</em>] finally decided me to try it. But nothing came of it in the end.</p><p>INTERVIEWER</p><p>How do you name your characters?</p><p>FORSTER</p><p>I usually find the name at the start, but not always. Rickie‚Äôs brother had several names. [<em>He showed us some early manuscript portions of</em> The Longest Journey <em>in which Stephen Wonham appeared as Siegfried; also an omitted chapter, which he described as ‚Äúextremely romantic</em>.‚Äù] Wonham is a country name and so is Quested. [<em>We looked at an early draft of</em> A Passage to India, <em>in which to his surprise the heroine was found going under the name of Edith. This was later changed to Janet, before becoming Adela</em>.] Herriton I made up. Munt was the name of my first governess in the house in Hertfordshire. There really was a family called Howard who once owned the real Howards End. <em>Where Angels Fear to Tread</em> should have been called ‚ÄúMonteriano,‚Äù but the publisher thought this wouldn‚Äôt sell. It was Dent [<em>Professor E. J. Dent</em>] who gave me the present title.</p><p>INTERVIEWER</p><p>How much do you admit to modeling your characters on real people?</p><p>FORSTER</p><p>We all like to pretend we don‚Äôt use real people, but one does actually. I used some of my family. Miss Bartlett was my Aunt Emily‚Äîthey all read the book but they none of them saw it. Uncle Willie turned into Mrs. Failing. He was a bluff and simple character (<em>correcting himself</em>)‚Äîbluff without being simple. Miss Lavish was actually a Miss Spender. Mrs. Honeychurch was my grandmother. The three Miss Dickinsons condensed into two Miss Schlegels. Philip Herriton I modeled on Professor Dent. He knew this and took an interest in his own progress. I have used several tourists.</p><p>INTERVIEWER</p><p>Do all your characters have real-life models?</p><p>FORSTER</p><p>In no book have I got down more than the people I like, the person I think I am, and the people who irritate me. This puts me among the large body of authors who are not really novelists and have to get on as best they can with these three categories. We have not the power of observing the variety of life and describing it dispassionately. There are a few who have done this. Tolstoy was one, wasn‚Äôt he?</p><p>INTERVIEWER</p><p>Can you say anything about the process of turning a real person into a fictional one?</p><p>FORSTER</p><p>A useful trick is to look back upon such a person with half-closed eyes, fully describing certain characteristics. I am left with about two-thirds of a human being and can get to work. A likeness isn‚Äôt aimed at, and couldn‚Äôt be obtained, because a man‚Äôs only himself amid the particular circumstances of his life and not amid other circumstances. So that to refer back to Dent when Philip was in difficulties with Gino, or to ask one and one-half Miss Dickinsons how Helen should comport herself with an illegitimate baby, would have ruined the atmosphere and the book. When all goes well, the original material soon disappears, and a character who belongs to the book and nowhere else emerges.</p><p>INTERVIEWER</p><p>Do any of your characters represent yourself at all?</p><p>FORSTER</p><p>Rickie more than any. Also Philip. And Cecil [<em>in</em> A Room with a View] has got something of Philip in him.</p><p>INTERVIEWER</p><p>What degree of reality do your characters have for you after you have finished writing about them?</p><p>FORSTER</p><p>Very variable. There are some I like thinking about. Rickie and Stephen, and Margaret Schlegel‚Äîthey are characters whose fortunes I have been interested to follow. It doesn‚Äôt matter if they died in the novel or not.</p><p>INTERVIEWER</p><p>We have got a few more questions about your work as a whole. First, to what degree is each novel an entirely fresh experiment?</p><p>FORSTER</p><p>To quite a large extent. But I wonder if experiment is the word?</p><p>INTERVIEWER</p><p>Is there a hidden pattern behind the whole of an author‚Äôs work, what Henry James called ‚Äúa figure in the carpet‚Äù? Well, do you like having secrets from the reader?</p><p>FORSTER</p><p>Ah, now, that‚Äôs a different question &mldr; I was pleased when Peter Burra noticed that the wasp upon which Godbole meditates during the festival in <em>A Passage to India</em> had already appeared earlier in the novel.**</p><p>INTERVIEWER</p><p>Had the wasps any esoteric meaning?</p><p>FORSTER</p><p>Only in the sense that there is something esoteric in India about all animals. I was just putting it in; and afterwards I saw it was something that might return nonlogically in the story later.</p><p>INTERVIEWER</p><p>How far aware are you of your own technical clevernesses in general?</p><p>FORSTER</p><p>We keep coming back to that. People will not realize how little conscious one is of these things; how one flounders about. They want us to be so much better informed than we are. If critics could only have a course on writers‚Äô <em>not</em> thinking things out‚Äîa course of lectures &mldr;</p><p>INTERVIEWER</p><p>You have said elsewhere that the authors you have learned most from were Jane Austen and Proust. What did you learn from Jane Austen technically?</p><p>FORSTER</p><p>I learned the possibilities of domestic humor. I was more ambitious than she was, of course; I tried to hitch it on to other things.</p><p>INTERVIEWER</p><p>And from Proust?</p><p>FORSTER</p><p>I learned ways of looking at character from him. The modern subconscious way. He gave me as much of the modern way as I could take. I couldn‚Äôt read Freud or Jung myself; it had to be filtered to me.</p><p>INTERVIEWER</p><p>Did any other novelists influence you technically? What about Meredith?</p><p>FORSTER</p><p>I admired him‚Äî<em>The Egoist</em> and the better-constructed bits of the other novels, but then that‚Äôs not the same as his influencing me. I don‚Äôt know if he did that. He did things I couldn‚Äôt do. What I admired was the sense of one thing opening into another. You go into a room with him, and then that opens into another room, and that into a further one.</p><p>INTERVIEWER</p><p>What led you to make the remark quoted by Lionel Trilling, that the older you got the less it seemed to you to matter that an artist should ‚Äúdevelop.‚Äù</p><p>FORSTER</p><p>I am more interested in achievement than in advance on it and decline from it. And I am more interested in works than in authors. The paternal wish of critics to show how a writer dropped off or picked up as he went along seems to me misplaced. I am only interested in myself as a producer. What was it Mahler said?‚Äî‚Äúanyone will sufficiently understand me who will trace my development through my nine symphonies.‚Äù This seems odd to me; I couldn‚Äôt imagine myself making such a remark, it seems too uncasual. Other authors find themselves much more an object of study. I am conceited but not interested in myself in this particular way. Of course, I like reading my own work, and often do it. I go gently over the bits that I think are bad.</p><p>INTERVIEWER</p><p>But you think highly of your own work?</p><p>FORSTER</p><p>That was implicit, yes. My regret is that I haven‚Äôt written a bit more‚Äîthat the body, the corpus, isn‚Äôt bigger. I think I am different from other writers; they profess much more worry (I don‚Äôt know if it is genuine). I have always found writing pleasant and don‚Äôt understand what people mean by ‚Äúthroes of creation.‚Äù I‚Äôve enjoyed it, but believe that in some ways it is good. Whether it will last, I have no idea.</p><p>* The famous fifth chapter of <em>The Longest Journey</em> begins ‚ÄúGerald died that afternoon.‚Äù</p><p>** Burra was the author of the preface to the Everyman edition of <em>A Passage to India</em>.</p><p>from Hacker News <a class=link href=https://ift.tt/2Jqegho target=_blank rel=noopener>https://ift.tt/2Jqegho</a></p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-copyright><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="icon icon-tabler icon-tabler-copyright" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="2" stroke="currentcolor" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path stroke="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="9"/><path d="M14.5 9a3.5 4 0 100 6"/></svg><span>Licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</span></section></footer></article><footer class=site-footer><section class=copyright>&copy;
