Are we men ashamed to practice this body-mind-spirit wisdom because it became a women’s thing, or discriminative of the idea that we men are tough enough and don’t need this kind of “activity”? We know that the practice of Hatha Yoga was brought to our western culture in the 20th century by masculine Yoga masters, and that mostly men are the creators of the original Yoga Sutra of Patanjali approx. 200 B.C.E - 200 C.E., known also as Raja Yoga or King’s Yoga – the basis of all other Yoga forms practiced around the world.((Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy: <a class=link href=https://www.iep.utm.edu/yoga/#H3 target=_blank rel=noopener>The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali</a>)) Keep in mind that Yoga goes much deeper than the physical posture and breathing, yet they are the start and the basis for the inward journey of self-inquiry and self-discovery. The deeper you immerse in the practice, the more you’ll happen to find out about it. An Asana - <em>aasana</em>((Wikipedia: <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asana target=_blank rel=noopener>Asana</a>)) or <em>Yoga posture</em> is practiced with a purpose to mobilize the body and mind for achieving mental skills. This tells us that Yoga indeed is great for men. Not long ago, when I invited a friend of mine to a Yoga Asana session I was teaching, he looked at me discouraged with a shy smile on his face, saying “Really, Yoga for men? I don’t know about that. Me, with this belly, tense as I am, it would be an embarrassment to show myself in front of the other more flexible people, let alone perform postures.” I smiled back, and with encouraging voice told him &ldquo;You always talk about getting in shape! Just come over please and see how simple yoga exercises can change the way you feel about yourself!&rdquo; With the 7 exercises that follow, in just an hour, we succeeded to remove his misconceptions he had about yoga for men, and changed his <a class=link href=https://www.lifehack.org/830597/how-your-attitude-determines-your-success target=_blank rel=noopener>att</a>i<a class=link href=https://www.lifehack.org/830597/how-your-attitude-determines-your-success target=_blank rel=noopener>tude</a> positively. Although he was never fond of practicing in groups, he got hooked up - he liked all the beginner postures and started practicing at home regularly and diligently. The most important and ideal Yoga posture are: <em>“sthirasukhamaasanam”</em> – steady and comfortable posture. <em>Sthira</em> meaning steady, stable and strong and <em>sukham</em> meaning comfortable, easy and peaceful, and <em>aasana</em> meaning body posture or pose. This is the entire instruction from the whole Yoga Sutra (YS, 2.46-2.48) on how a Yoga posture ought to be performed. As long as you apply the elements of stability and comfort to your body posture and align it with your breath (YS, 2.47), you perform the <em>aasana</em> correctly. Every man who wants to gain control over his physical and mental well-being and achieve a healthier lifestyle has the reason to get into Yoga. And here is the deal, in the next seven Yoga exercises you’ll see how to get into Yoga safely and successfully.

Looking at all these simple yet highly beneficial postures, we can conclude that apart from the physiological benefits as mobilizing and strengthening the body, more important benefits out of these exercises are:</p><ul><li>The development of mental skills such as focus, motivation, observation, confidence, concentration by turning inwards through the focus on gentle breathing.</li><li>The regaining of vitality and building of stamina and <a class=link href=https://www.lifehack.org/845528/emotional-resilience target=_blank rel=noopener>resilience</a> through the repetition of movement.</li><li>The reduction of stress and neuroticism ((NCBI: <a class=link href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5428182/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Neuroticism</a>)) as a result of the above two.</li></ul><p>The benefits mentioned above are perceptible when a balanced flow between breath and body movement is created.

And if you choose to be a part of a yoga class don’t worry about how you look, and what you’re going to wear as long as your clothes are comfortable. Stay focused on what you want to achieve on a physical, mental and spiritual level. <strong>Keep in mind that everything you need for that new change in your life is sitting right here within you.</strong> Start to practice and the process of achievement will unfold! I salute the spirit in you!</p><h2 id=more-about-yoga>More About Yoga</h2><ul><li><a class=link href=https://www.lifehack.org/805787/morning-yoga target=_blank rel=noopener>How Practicing Morning Yoga Transforms Your Life (+10 Beginners’ Poses)</a></li><li><a class=link href=https://www.lifehack.org/837294/yoga-routine target=_blank rel=noopener>15-Minute Morning Yoga Routine for Beginners</a></li><li><a class=link href=https://www.lifehack.org/824793/yoga-meditation target=_blank rel=noopener>9 Reasons to Incorporate Yoga Meditation and Mindfulness into Your Life</a></li></ul><p>from Lifehack - Feed <a class=link href=https://ift.tt/2oa97Eu target=_blank rel=noopener>https://ift.tt/2oa97Eu</a><br>via <a class=link href="https://ifttt.com/?ref=da&site=blogger" target=_blank rel=noopener>IFTTT</a></p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-copyright><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="icon icon-tabler icon-tabler-copyright" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="2" stroke="currentcolor" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path stroke="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="9"/><path d="M14.5 9a3.5 4 0 100 6"/></svg><span>Licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</span></section></footer></article><footer class=site-footer><section class=copyright>&copy;
