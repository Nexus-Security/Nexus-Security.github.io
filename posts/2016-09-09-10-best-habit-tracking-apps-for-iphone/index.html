And, a plan is how we go about doing a certain thing in a structured way. So, carving it out upfront would be better.</p><h3 id=so-how-do-habit-tracker-apps-work>So, How Do Habit Tracker Apps Work?</h3><p>Habit tracker apps offer you complete freedom to make a customized routine based on your goal. Once everything is perfectly set up, you can follow your rules by sticking to all the essential points.

Oh yes, they also offer up insightful tips to light up your mood and even prevent you from giving up mid-way. Having said that, let’s get started with the top habit tracking apps for Android and iOS, shall we?</p><h2 id=1-habitshare>1. HabitShare</h2><p>For a more <strong>simplified habit tracking experience</strong>, “HabitShare” is one of my top picks. Probably the best part about this app is the ability to make habit tracking absolute fun by keeping complexity at bay. For starters, you can ideally customize it to keep a tab on all the important aspects and stick to the set rules with the timely reminders. Thanks to the <strong>detailed charts, daily/weekly habit goals, and insightful comments</strong>, the app keeps you on track. Besides, you also have the option to add friends to bring some fun elements into the mix.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/HabitShare.jpg loading=lazy alt=HabitShare></p><p>Once your friends have accepted your invites, they can <strong>view your progress and motivate you to give 100%</strong>.

Overall, should you want to track your habits with ease, HabitShare can be the right answer to your needs.</p><p><em><strong>Price:</strong> Free</em></p><p><em><strong>Install:</strong> <a class=link href=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/habitshare-habit-tracker/id1048191045 target=_blank rel=noopener>iOS</a> and <a class=link href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.habitshareapp&hl=en_IN" target=_blank rel=noopener>Android </a></em></p><h2 id=2-habitica>2. Habitica</h2><p>What I like the most about Habitica is a <strong>unique way to track habits</strong> or whatever you have planned to accomplish. First and foremost, the app gamifies the whole affair so that tracking goals doesn’t become a mundane experience. You can create a custom avatar and check off each task to unlock plenty of goodies like <strong>loving pets, robust armors, exciting quests, and great skills.</strong></p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Habitica.jpg loading=lazy alt=Habitica></p><p>Moreover, you can also <a class=link href=https://beebom.com/best-multiplayer-games-for-iphone/ target=_blank rel=noopener>team up with your friends to eliminate monsters</a>. And if you perform exceedingly well, the app will offer you a chance to <strong>grab a ton of rewards.</strong> Keep in mind, failing to live up to the expectation will also make you accountable. So, you’ve got to be spot on with your duties and always complete them just in time. While Habitica is available for free, the optional subscriptions allow you to use all the features without any restrictions. If you like the idea of a <strong>fully gamified habit tracking</strong>, you shouldn’t miss out on this app.</p><p>_<strong>Price:</strong> Free, in-app purchases available _</p><p><em><strong>Install:</strong> <a class=link href=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/habitica-gamified-taskmanager/id994882113 target=_blank rel=noopener>iOS</a> and <a class=link href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.habitrpg.android.habitica&hl=en_IN" target=_blank rel=noopener>Android </a></em></p><h2 id=3-productive>3. Productive</h2><p>If you have set your sight on <strong>becoming more productive by getting rid of all the shortcomings</strong> that tend to prevent you from carrying out your tasks with the desired flair, I would recommend you to check out Productive. The app is pretty simple to get started, allowing you to make a custom routine with positive and life-turning routines. Once you have set up the habit, you can follow the guideline with full commitment to achieve the goal.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Habit-Tracking-app-named-Productive.jpg loading=lazy alt="Habit Tracking app named Productive"></p><p>Productive lets you keep track of all the pivotal aspects, ensuring you remain in the know about both your strong and weak points. Thus, you can <strong>derive SWOT (strength, weakness, opportunity, and threat)</strong> with ease. One of my favorite features of this app is the location-based reminder that goes a long way in taking control of certain habits. Besides, I also like the motivating stats that kind of keep the adrenaline in high spirit. Do note that Productive offers a limited free trial, so you will need to go for the premium offering to use all the goodies without any limitations.</p><p>_<strong>Price:</strong> Free, in-app purchases available _</p><p><em><strong>Install:</strong> <a class=link href=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/productive-habit-tracker/id983826477 target=_blank rel=noopener>iOS</a> and <a class=link href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apalon.to.do.list&hl=en_IN" target=_blank rel=noopener>Android </a></em></p><h2 id=4-habitify>4. Habitify</h2><p>Whether you want to take control of your daily routine or keep track of your goal, Habitify can fit into your needs with ease. The habit tracking app is quite flexible, allowing you to fine-tune everything in line with your requirements. For instance, you can <strong>group habits</strong> by time and even their types to make it more convenient to track each one of them. Additionally, it also <strong>shows skip, failed, and complete status</strong> so that you have a more precise habit tracking experience.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Habitfy.jpg loading=lazy alt=Habitify></p><p>Another feature that’s worth noting is the detailed chart that displays various important information including <strong>daily performance, check-in time, yearly review</strong> and more. As a result, you have a much better insight into where you stand, what is your Achilles heel, and more importantly; the steps needed to address the downsides. Furthermore, Habitify provides a privacy lock to prevent prying eyes from bumping into your personal information.</p><p>_<strong>Price:</strong> Free, in-app purchases available _</p><p><em><strong>Install:</strong> <a class=link href=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/habitify-habit-tracker/id1111447047 target=_blank rel=noopener>iOS</a> and <a class=link href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.unstatic.habitify&hl=en_IN" target=_blank rel=noopener>Android </a></em></p><h2 id=5-strides>5. Strides</h2><p>If there were a race to be a <strong>feature-rich habit tracking app for iOS</strong>, “Strides” would finish right at the top – along with the best in the business. So, if you are someone who admires a highly intuitive user-interface along with a whole host of features, keep this app in mind. One of the biggest highlights of this app is the super handy <strong>streak <a class=link href=https://beebom.com/best-calendar-apps-iphone/ target=_blank rel=noopener>calendar</a></strong> that makes it pretty straightforward to track all the habits. And with an ever-growing library of over 150 predefined templates, designing a goal tracking routine is never a big deal.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Strides.jpg loading=lazy alt=Strides></p><p>Want to have more control over your habit tracking? No problem? You have the freedom to <strong>make a personalized routine</strong> with all the custom rules. As someone who prefers to have insightful reporting, I have found its <strong>detailed charts</strong> quite helpful. They make it convenient to analyze each data and easily spot the snags. Another feature that has caught my eyes is the option to <a class=link href=https://beebom.com/best-note-apps-iphone/ target=_blank rel=noopener>add extra notes</a> that can prove to be a boon especially for the folks who often forget to do things. In short, Strides is a safe bet for a fully personalized goal tracking.</p><p>_<strong>Price:</strong> Free, in-app purchases available _</p><p><em><strong>Install:</strong> <a class=link href=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/strides-habit-tracker/id672401817 target=_blank rel=noopener>iOS</a></em></p><h2 id=6-habit-bull>6. Habit-Bull</h2><p>While there is a lot to like in Habit-Bull, I would like to highlight three main features that make it worth giving a chance. First and foremost, the habit tracking app offers an <strong>easy way to track multiple habits along with repeated to-dos</strong> in the personalized calendar. And with the intuitive streak counter as well as the success percentage, it helps you keep an eye on the progress without needing to dive into the detail. Perfect for those who want to track their streaks on the move!</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Habit-Bull.jpg loading=lazy alt="Habit Bull"></p><p>Times when you feel a little down or don’t get the desired motivation to continue, some sort of impetus comes in really handy. Considering this crucial aspect, Habit-Bull keeps you charged up with the <strong>inspiring quotes</strong> that can light up the mood and also push you to give your best. Additionally, the app provides a seamless <strong>cloud backup and multi-device syncing</strong> so that all of your data remains secure and easily accessible across devices.</p><p>_<strong>Price:</strong> Free, in-app purchases available _</p><p><em><strong>Install:</strong> <a class=link href=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/habit-bull-daily-goal-tracker/id1041482672 target=_blank rel=noopener>iOS</a> and <a class=link href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oristats.habitbull&hl=en_IN" target=_blank rel=noopener>Android </a></em></p><h2 id=7-loop>7. Loop</h2><p>For those in quest of a <strong>powerful habit tracker designed specifically for Android</strong> devices, Loop appears to be a front-runner. The app may sport a simple design language but it comes with a range of easy-to-use tools that makes tracking habits a painless exercise. Being completely <strong>ad-free and open-source</strong> also helps its cause – to a great extent. It has a little different technique for calculating the habit score. While every repetition strengthens your habit, every missed day makes it weaker. In terms of analyzing your data, I find Loop up to the mark courtesy the presence of several charts. Furthermore, it also makes allows users to <strong>export data to spreadsheets (CSV)</strong> or to a database file (SQLite) which can be helpful for both sharing and compiling data.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Loop.jpg loading=lazy alt=Loop></p><p>_<strong>Price:</strong> Free, in-app purchases available _</p><p><em><strong>Install:</strong> <a class=link href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.isoron.uhabits&hl=en_IN" target=_blank rel=noopener>Android </a></em></p><h2 id=8-habit>8. Habit</h2><p>Due mainly to the <strong>minimal design language and easy-to-use tools</strong>, Habit hasn’t failed to catch my attention. The app aims at making habit tracking an upfront task – free of any complexities. Depending on how you want to embrace good practices and give up the bad ones, you can <strong>schedule habits and monitor your performance</strong>. Thanks to the helpful widget, you can keep an eye on your progress without having to dive into the app. Additionally, the detailed graphs and statistics make you fully aware of how you have gotten better over time and even the areas that haven’t yet been addressed properly. Beyond progress tracking, I have found it quite smooth and snappier. Besides, Habit is also ad-free, letting you use it without any inconvenience.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Habit-daily-tracker.jpg loading=lazy alt="Habit daily tracker"></p><p>_<strong>Price:</strong> Free, in-app purchases available _</p><p><em><strong>Install:</strong> <a class=link href=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/habit-daily-tracker/id1445651730 target=_blank rel=noopener>iOS</a></em></p><h2 id=9-goal-tracker--habit-list--workout-calendar>9. Goal Tracker & Habit List & Workout Calendar</h2><p>Yet another habit tracker designed specifically for Android users! Having given it a close look, I must say that it deserves serious consideration for multiple reasons. For one, the app <strong>goes well beyond the usual habit tracking</strong>. I mean it’s a one-stop platform for tracking goals and developing good habits for improved productivity. That aside, it also allows users to schedule habits with the desired flexibility. And with the <strong>custom alerts</strong>, it reminds them of each task that needs immediate attention. Even better, the app automatically backs up all the data and even allow them to <strong>export to <a class=link href=https://beebom.com/dropbox-altenatives-cloud-storage-services/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Dropbox</a></strong> for easier access across devices.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Daily-view.jpg loading=lazy alt="Goal Tracker & Habit List & Workout Calendar"></p><p>_<strong>Price:</strong> Free, in-app purchases available _</p><p><em><strong>Install:</strong> <a class=link href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.intrasoft.habitgoaltracker" target=_blank rel=noopener>Android </a></em></p><h2 id=10-done>10. Done</h2><p>While Done may not be the most feature-packed habit tracker for iOS, it has got enough to offer a more pragmatic habit tracking experience. You can use this app for both <strong>building great habits and destroying bad ones</strong> at your own pace. With a variety of color options, it lets you add some nice personal touch to goal tracking. Additionally, you can also note down your thoughts with each routine so that they won’t slip out of your mind. As it <strong>also supports Face ID/ Touch ID</strong>, no one will be able to access your personal data without your permission. And if you ever want to share the data with anyone, you can export it in CSV format – which is yet another plus. Lastly, it’s worth noting that Done’s freemium version allows you to create only three habits. To break this limitation, you will need to go for the Done premium ($8.99 – one-time premium upgrade).</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Done-daily-tracker.jpg loading=lazy alt="Done daily tracker"></p><p>_<strong>Price:</strong> Free, in-app purchases available _</p><p><em><strong>Install:</strong> <a class=link href=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/done-a-simple-habit-tracker/id1103961876 target=_blank rel=noopener>iOS</a></em></p><h2 id=choose-the-best-habit-tracking-apps-for-ios-and-android>Choose the Best Habit Tracking Apps for iOS and Android</h2><p>Hopefully, you have found the right app to track habits on your iOS or Android device. As I said above, giving up a habit is never easy. However, you can get the better of it with a good mix of motivation and determination. So, stick to the plan by following the custom rules and taking the much-needed inspiration from life-changing quotes. By the way, which app have you chosen and what are the features you have found appreciable in it?
