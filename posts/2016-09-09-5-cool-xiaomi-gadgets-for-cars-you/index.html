Well, we got a lot of these gadgets from China, and I‚Äôve used them quite a bit in the last couple of weeks, and honestly, I‚Äôve started loving them. So here are 5 of my favorite car gadgets from Xiaomi.</p><h2 id=1-xiaomi-wireless-charger>1. Xiaomi Wireless Charger</h2><p>This is a gadget I personally fell in love with almost as soon as I started using it. The Xiaomi Wireless Charger nails everything there is to consider about a wireless car charger. The design is great, the build is top-notch, it uses USB Type-C, it supports 20W fast wireless charging, and it has sensors built in to automatically open and close the clamps when your phone is near the charger, or when you‚Äôre trying to take the phone out of the charger.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/xiaomi-car-wireless-charger.jpg loading=lazy alt="xiaomi car wireless charger"></p><p>I‚Äôm not coming at this from no experience either, I‚Äôve used quite a few car chargers over the last few years, but this one is good at everything I need a car charger to do for me. In fact, I liked this so much I wrote an individual article just about this charger, and I‚Äôd suggest you go <a class=link href=https://beebom.com/xiaomi-wireless-car-charger-first-impressions/ target=_blank rel=noopener>read that</a> to get a more detailed look at the charger.</p><p><em>If you want, you can get this wireless car charger from Banggood (<a class=link href=https://www.banggood.in/custlink/DDGKQ4R70m target=_blank rel=noopener>‚Çπ3,553</a>)</em></p><h2 id=2-cleanfly-vacuum-cleaner>2. Cleanfly Vacuum Cleaner</h2><p>If you‚Äôre anything like me, chances are you snack in your car, which is all good but it does end up making a mess inside the car. Add to that all the dirt and mud you track into your car with your shoes everyday, and it‚Äôs just sad. That‚Äôs where having a vacuum cleaner can come in really handy, and you guessed it, Xiaomi makes that as well.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cleanfly-vacuum-cleaner-image.jpg loading=lazy alt="cleanfly vacuum cleaner "></p><p>The Cleanfly vacuum cleaner might have a weird name, but the vacuum cleaner itself is really good. For one, it‚Äôs designed exceptionally well. It‚Äôs clean, it‚Äôs minimal, and it‚Äôs matte grey ‚Äî all things that I really like. It‚Äôs also very well balanced when in use. The vacuum cleaner has a centre of gravity that‚Äôs closer to the handle, which makes it easier to use the vacuum cleaner without tiring out your hands. In fact, this might be the most comfortable and versatile car vacuum cleaners I‚Äôve used, and yes, I‚Äôm including the <a class=link href=https://beebom.com/dyson-v11-absolute-pro-review/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Dyson V11 Absolute Pro</a> I reviewed a while back. To be fair though, this isn‚Äôt nearly as powerful as the Dyson, but it‚Äôs a fraction of the price as well.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cleanfly-vacuum-cleaner-image-2.jpg loading=lazy alt="cleanfly vacuum cleaner is portable"></p><p>It charges via the car‚Äôs 12V outlet, or you can just plug in the USB Type-A cable to a regular phone charger in your house if you want. The vacuum cleaner runs for around 15 minutes after a 90 minute full charge, which isn‚Äôt the best thing about it, but it‚Äôs good enough to vacuum a hatchback.</p><p><em>Buy the Cleanfly Vacuum Cleaner from ShareSave (<a class=link href="https://sharesave.mi.com/in/products/4818?from=copyLink" target=_blank rel=noopener>‚Çπ3,766</a>)</em></p><h2 id=3-xiaomi-150psi-tyre-inflator>3. Xiaomi 150PSI Tyre Inflator</h2><p>This is a gadget that was a mystery to almost every one at the Beebom office when we first got this shipped. It looks great, so naturally every one kept looking at it and guessing what it could be. Personally, I thought it could‚Äôve been a smart speaker because of the speaker-like grilles on the sides, or maybe a walkie-talkie (Xiaomi does make those, by the way). However, this is just a really cool looking tyre inflator.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/xiaomi-tyre-inflator-modes.jpg loading=lazy alt="xiaomi tyre inflator modes"></p><p>As the name suggests, it can go up to 150PSI if you need that, but you probably won‚Äôt need that. The inflator can be charged and with one full charge, Xiaomi claims it can fill 5 car tyres. However, in my testing, I found it to be filling around 2 to 3 tyres in a single charge, which is still really good considering its size. Along with that, the tyre inflator comes with preset values for filling air in things like bicycles, bikes, and footballs, which is great because you don‚Äôt have to worry about remembering the pressure values for all those things.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/xiaomi-air-pump-microusb-port.jpg loading=lazy alt="xiaomi air pump uses a microUSB to charge"></p><p>The only things I really have to complain about here are that it takes way too long to fill up a tyre, which can quickly get annoying, and the microUSB charging port it uses. I mean, seriously. Why microUSB? It makes no sense. Other than that though, this is a great tyre inflator that you should definitely consider buying.</p><p><em>Buy the Xiaomi 150PSI Tyre Inflator from Banggood (<a class=link href=https://www.banggood.in/custlink/GDGmsnJKmN target=_blank rel=noopener>‚Çπ7,023</a>)</em></p><h2 id=4-xiaomi-dual-qc30-car-charger>4. Xiaomi Dual QC3.0 Car Charger</h2><p>This particular product is something I started using because it solves a very particular problem for me. See, sometimes I‚Äôm driving with my friends and everyone needs to charge their phones, which means people end up arguing over who gets to plug their phone in to the car-charger.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/xiaomi-dual-quickcharge-3.0-car-charger.jpg loading=lazy alt="xiaomi dual quickcharge 3.0 car charger"></p><p>The Xiaomi Dual QC3.0 car charger however brings <strong>two USB Type-A ports, and a USB Type-C connector.</strong> But there‚Äôs a huge catch there. The USB Type-C connector on this isn‚Äôt a female USB Type-C, which means you can‚Äôt plug in your phone‚Äôs charging cable into this if your phone uses a Type-C to Type-C cable or something. However, Xiaomi sells an accessory that plugs into this male Type-C connector to extend the charger for passengers in the rear as well.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/xiaomi-dual-qc3.0-car-charger-male-usb-c-connector.jpg loading=lazy alt="xiaomi dual qc3.0 car charger male usb c connector"></p><p>What‚Äôs actually very impressive about this charger is the fact that it supports Quick Charge 3.0 on both the USB-A ports simultaneously, so you can fast-charge two smartphones at the same time using this charger. Pretty cool, right?</p><p><em>Buy the Xiaomi Dual QC3.0 Car Charger from Banggood (<a class=link href=https://www.banggood.in/custlink/KDDKQscvKM target=_blank rel=noopener>‚Çπ1,532</a>)</em></p><h2 id=5-xiaomi-dashcam-1s>5. Xiaomi Dashcam 1S</h2><p>There‚Äôs also the Xiaomi Dashcam 1S, which honestly, is a fairly cool gadget, but there are some issues here that I just can‚Äôt get past. I‚Äôll talk about that later.</p><p>The Mi Dashcam 1S comes with a <strong>3-inch display</strong> on the back, along with capacitive buttons to control the camera, and access its menu. There‚Äôs a <strong>140-degree ultra-wide lens up front</strong>, and there are speakers, and a built-in battery as well.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/xiaomi-dashcam-1s-lens.jpg loading=lazy></p><p>The dashcam takes decent quality footage, and works perfectly even at night, which is great. All you need to do is put in a microSD card (which is not included in the box), connect the Dashcam 1S to a power source and that‚Äôs it, it automatically keeps recording videos.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/mi-dashcam-1s-microsd-card.jpg loading=lazy alt="mi dashcam 1s microsd card"></p><p>The thing, however, is that the dashcam is all in Chinese, which means you will have to use Google Translate a lot in order to set it up properly. However, it can connect to the Mi Home app, and you can view all the recorded footage right there in your phone, and even download the footage to your phone if you want, so once you‚Äôre past the set-up stage, you don‚Äôt really need to worry about the fact that there‚Äôs no English support on this yet.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/mi-dashcam-1s-chinese-interface.jpg loading=lazy alt="mi dashcam 1s chinese interface"></p><p>However, there are other problems here as well, big ones. First up, it also uses microUSB for power which is just stupid. But, the bigger issue is that of the wiring, because you need to somehow route the power cable all the way along the side of the car, tape it under the dashboard, and route it properly to the car-charger to power it up, or otherwise it will just dangle around and look really bad. That‚Äôs the reason I‚Äôm not willing to use this Dashcam.</p><p>If you‚Äôre not as lazy as I am, and you‚Äôre willing to put in the work to properly wire this thing, or if you don‚Äôt mind wires dangling around in your car, you can go ahead and buy this.</p><p><em>Buy the Mi Smart Dashcam 1S from ShareSave (<a class=link href="https://sharesave.mi.com/in/products/4436?from=copyLink" target=_blank rel=noopener>‚Çπ4,122</a>)</em></p><p><em>**Note:¬†**Keep in mind that most of these products are priced way higher in India when compared to their Chinese pricing, and they also take a long time to get delivered here. When we ordered these gadgets for ourselves, it took around a month to get delivered.</em></p><h2 id=deck-up-your-car-with-these-cool-xiaomi-car-gadgets>Deck Up Your Car with These Cool Xiaomi Car Gadgets</h2><p>I have been using these car gadgets everyday for the past few weeks, and I loved it. In fact, I‚Äôm planning on keeping some of these for myself, especially that wireless charger with the automatically opening clamps. I love that thing. Other than that though, I also really like the vacuum cleaner, and the dual QC3.0 charger is great too, but it‚Äôs not very useful for me since I‚Äôm an iPhone user, so Quick Charge 3 doesn‚Äôt make much sense for my smartphone.
