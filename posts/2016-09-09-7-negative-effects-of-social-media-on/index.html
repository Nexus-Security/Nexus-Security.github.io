you‚Äôve probably fallen victim to the power that social networking sites have on people. The chances are that you‚Äôve also experienced some of the negative effects of social media on people who use them.</p><p><strong>Unlock the free &ldquo;Facebook Security Checklist&rdquo; now!</strong></p><p>This will sign you up to our newsletter</p><p>Enter your Email</p><p>Unlock</p><p><a class=link href=//www.makeuseof.com/legal/>Read our privacy policy</a></p><p>Unfortunately, the bad effects of social media are all too real for a lot of us. Let‚Äôs look at the negative impact of social media on real people that happens every day.</p><h2 id=how-social-media-is-bad-for-you>How Social Media Is Bad for You</h2><p>You might be surprised to learn that the negative effects of social media are both physical and mental. They can change your perception of the world and yourself. While <a class=link href=//www.makeuseof.com/tag/positive-impact-social-networking-sites-society-opinion/>social media does have some positive effects</a>, it also has a lot in the drawback column.</p><p>Don‚Äôt believe it? Read on for a list of social media‚Äôs negative effects. If you recognize any of them as issues in your own life, it may be time to reduce your usage or even stop using social media altogether.</p><h2 id=1-depression-and-anxiety>1. Depression and Anxiety</h2><p>Do you spend several hours per day browsing through social media? Spending too long on social networking sites could be adversely affecting your mood. In fact, chronic users are more likely to report poor mental health, including symptoms of anxiety and depression.</p><p>It doesn‚Äôt take much thinking to figure out why. Social media lets you see the carefully selected best parts of everyone else‚Äôs lives, which you compare to the negatives in your own life. Comparing yourself to other people is a sure path to anxiety, and social media has only made this easier to do.</p><p>So how do you use social media without causing yourself psychological distress? If you turn to the same research (and common sense), the recommended amount of time you should spend on social networks is around half an hour per day. As with many other potential ills in life, it‚Äôs all about moderation.</p><h2 id=2-cyberbullying>2. Cyberbullying</h2><p>Image Credit: HighwayStarz/<a class=link href=https://depositphotos.com/70434495/stock-photo-teenage-girl-being-bullied-by.html target=_blank rel=noopener>Depositphotos</a></p><p>Before social media, bullying was something that was only possible to do face-to-face. However, now people can bully others online‚Äîanonymously or not. Today everyone knows what cyberbullying is, and most of us have seen what it can do to a person.</p><p>While social media makes it easier to meet new people and make friends, it also enables cruel people to tear into others with little effort. Perpetrators of bullying can use the anonymity that social networks provide to gain people‚Äôs trust and then terrorize them in front of their peers. For instance, they might create a fake profile and act friendly to a classmate, then later betray and embarrass them online.</p><p>These online attacks often leave deep mental scars and even drive people to suicide in some cases. And as it turns out, cyberbullying doesn‚Äôt just affect kids. Adults can become victims of online abuse, too. Since screens hide our faces, you can end up being a jerk on social media and other websites without even realizing it.</p><p>Learn <a class=link href=//www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-hide-your-social-media-profiles/>how to hide your social media profiles</a> if you suffer from this issue.</p><h2 id=3-fomo-fear-of-missing-out>3. FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)</h2><p>Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) is a phenomenon that was born around the same time as the rise of social media. Unsurprisingly, it‚Äôs one of the most widespread negative effects of social media on society.</p><p>FOMO is just what it sounds like: a form of anxiety that you get when you‚Äôre scared of missing out on a positive experience that someone else is having. For example, you might constantly check your messages to see if anyone has invited you out, or focus on your Instagram feed all day to make sure that nobody is doing something cool without you.</p><p>This fear receives constant fuel from what you see on social media. With increased social network use, there‚Äôs a better chance for you to see that someone is having more fun that you are right now. And that‚Äôs exactly what causes FOMO.</p><h2 id=4-unrealistic-expectations>4. Unrealistic Expectations</h2><p>Image Credit: prometeus/<a class=link href=https://depositphotos.com/190513612/stock-photo-making-selfie-on-a-party.html target=_blank rel=noopener>Depositphotos</a></p><p>As most people probably know by now, social media forms unrealistic expectations of life and friendships in our minds.</p><p>Most social media sites have a severe lack of online authenticity. People use Snapchat to share their exciting adventures, post about how much they love their significant other on Facebook, and load up their Instagram page with heavily staged photos.</p><p>But in reality, you have no way of knowing whether this is all a farce. While it looks great on the surface, that person could be in massive debt, on bad terms with their significant other, and just desperate for Instagram likes as a form of validation.</p><p>One simple way out of this mess is for everyone to quit lying on social media. But in the era of Instagram influencers and YouTubers who earn millions from being inauthentic, that isn‚Äôt going to happen anytime soon.</p><h2 id=5-negative-body-image>5. Negative Body Image</h2><p>Speaking of Instagram celebrities, if you look at popular Instagram accounts, you‚Äôll find unbelievably beautiful people wearing expensive clothes on their perfectly shaped bodies.</p><p>Today, body image is an issue for everyone. Of course, seeing so many people who are supposedly perfect (according to society‚Äôs standards) on a daily basis makes you conscious about how different you look from those pictures. And not everyone comes to healthy conclusions in this situation.</p><p>It‚Äôs really important to remember that everybody is human. No one wakes up every day looking like a supermodel, and while many people have gone to great lengths to train their bodies, that‚Äôs not the case for everyone who looks fit. Many people, in search of social media fame, have definitely taken unhealthy routes to appear more attractive.</p><p>Surround yourself with people who love you for who you are, and you won‚Äôt have to stress about Instagram beauty.</p><h2 id=6-unhealthy-sleep-patterns>6. Unhealthy Sleep Patterns</h2><p>On top of increasing the incidents of anxiety and depression, spending too much time on social media can lead to poor sleep. Numerous studies have shown that increased use of social media has a negative effect on your sleep quality.</p><p>If you feel like your sleep patterns have become irregular and have led to a drop in productivity, try to cut down on the amount of time you browse social media.</p><p>This is especially the case when using your phone in bed at night. It‚Äôs all too easy to tell yourself that you‚Äôll spend five minutes checking your Facebook notifications, only to realize an hour later that you‚Äôve been mindlessly scrolling through Twitter content you don‚Äôt even care about. Don‚Äôt let social media algorithms steal your valuable sleep.</p><h2 id=7-general-addiction>7. General Addiction</h2><p>Social media can be more addictive than cigarettes and alcohol. It has a powerful draw for many people that leads to them checking it all the time without even thinking about it.</p><p>If you‚Äôre not sure whether you‚Äôre addicted to social networks, try to remember the last time you went a full day without checking any social media accounts. Do you feel rejected if someone unfollows you? And if your favorite social networks completely disappeared tomorrow, would it make you feel empty and depressed?</p><p>At the end of the day, social media sites want to keep you scrolling for as long as possible so they can show you lots of ads and make more money. Because of <a class=link href=//www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-attention-economy/>the attention economy</a>, these sites need your eyes on them for as long as possible.</p><p>Just because you‚Äôve been going overboard on social media use doesn‚Äôt mean you necessarily need to wipe out all social networking platforms. However, if you think quitting is the best solution for you, it isn‚Äôt a bad idea. In fact, you can find out <a class=link href=//www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-happens-when-you-quit-social-media-i-found-out/>what it‚Äôs like to quit social media</a> through a firsthand story.</p><h2 id=how-to-handle-the-negative-effects-of-social-media>How to Handle the Negative Effects of Social Media</h2><p>As with everything else, there are good and bad aspects of social media. We‚Äôve discussed some of the negative impacts social media has for many, but you‚Äôre the one who must decide whether there‚Äôs more help or harm in it for you personally.</p><p>If you find that social media is having a negative impact on your life, quit. However, if you decide to stay, use our <a class=link href=//www.makeuseof.com/tag/waste-less-time-social-media/>tips to waste less time on social media</a> to maintain your hobby in a healthy manner.</p><p>Read the full article: <a class=link href=https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/negative-effects-social-media/ target=_blank rel=noopener>7 Negative Effects of Social Media on People and Users</a></p><p>from MakeUseOf <a class=link href=https://ift.tt/2GmzQ3z target=_blank rel=noopener>https://ift.tt/2GmzQ3z</a><br>via <a class=link href="https://ifttt.com/?ref=da&site=blogger" target=_blank rel=noopener>IFTTT</a></p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-copyright><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="icon icon-tabler icon-tabler-copyright" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="2" stroke="currentcolor" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path stroke="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="9"/><path d="M14.5 9a3.5 4 0 100 6"/></svg><span>Licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</span></section></footer></article><footer class=site-footer><section class=copyright>&copy;
