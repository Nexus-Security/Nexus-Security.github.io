A post parodied the <a class=link href=https://me.me/i/blacks-black-lives-matter-wypipo-no-all-lives-matter-blacks-08aad1414aba48a8a419eebc790c1162 target=_blank rel=noopener>discomfort</a> many white people seem to feel with the phrase ‚Äúblack lives matter.‚Äù Participants <a class=link href=https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/comments/8gig6z/this_coloniser_doesnt_even_provide_lunch/ target=_blank rel=noopener>riffed on</a> the rapper Kanye West‚Äôs suggestion that slavery had lasted too long <a class=link href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/arts/music/100000005880261/kanye-west-likened-slavery-to-a-choice-history-says-otherwise.html?module=inline" target=_blank rel=noopener>to have been involuntary</a>. Conversations about topics in the news and personal encounters with racial bias were interspersed with sometimes off-color humor about sex, romance and lifestyle advice.</p><p>Given that the vast majority of Reddit users are white, no one seemed to be under the illusion that only black people would weigh in. As one of the forum‚Äôs moderators recalled, the thought was that the white users who held sway in nearly all of <a class=link href=http://redditlist.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Reddit‚Äôs 157,100 other communities</a>, known as subreddits, would see no need to dominate this one.</p><p>The moderators were wrong.</p><p>It can be difficult to tell a person‚Äôs race on Reddit. Its several hundred million users are known to one another only by their screen names, without the profile pictures and biographies that are typical of other social media sites. That can be a boon to free speech, say proponents of the policy. It also encourages hate speech, detractors maintain.</p><p>In the case of the Reddit forum, which was called <a class=link href=https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Black People Twitter</a>, some of the comments appeared to be more an attempt to mock black culture than to appreciate it.</p><p>Many black users came to believe that white users were pretending to be black to give their unpopular opinions more credibility. Some of the posts casually dropped racial slurs. Others repeated anti-black stereotypes about crime, parenting and intelligence. <a class=link href=https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/comments/cl03ps/where_do_i_sign/evs54lp/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Beyonc√© was</a> <a class=link href=https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/comments/cl03ps/where_do_i_sign/evs54lp/ target=_blank rel=noopener>disparaged</a>.</p><p>‚ÄúThese people are white,‚Äù said Tony Hinderman, 23, a black actor in Chicago. ‚ÄúBlack people love Beyonc√©. There is nothing to not love about her.‚Äù</p><p>The weight of unseen white opinion also made itself felt through the Reddit ranking system, in which posts and comments rise or fall in visibility based on users clicking on the ‚Äúup‚Äù or ‚Äúdown‚Äù arrows next to each.</p><p>Image<img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/09/us/09racereddit3/merlin_159955329_b1896e44-93b2-4f18-81f4-a0be186900a8-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale" loading=lazy alt="Wesley Moreno, who was a moderator of the Black People Twitter forum on Reddit until recently, called disruptive comments posted by white users pretending to be black ‚Äúa constant form of gaslighting.‚Äù"></p><p>Wesley Moreno, who was a moderator of the Black People Twitter forum on Reddit until recently, called disruptive comments posted by white users pretending to be black ‚Äúa constant form of gaslighting.‚ÄùCreditCody O&rsquo;Loughlin for The New York Times</p><p>A comment on a post about a first-generation black college student‚Äôs <a class=link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/comments/bf41ts/wholesome_black_tweet/?sort=new" target=_blank rel=noopener>entry to Harvard Medical School</a> ‚Äî ‚Äúyou‚Äôll be attending <a class=link href="https://www.removeddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/comments/bf41ts/wholesome_black_tweet/?sort=new" target=_blank rel=noopener>thanks to affirmative action</a>‚Äù ‚Äî received hundreds of ‚Äúupvotes‚Äù before it was removed by a moderator.

These days the subreddit is run by a multiracial group of more than two dozen moderators, many of whom are black.</p><p>Like all Reddit moderators, they perform tasks like approving posts and banning users; they work without pay, in exchange for mostly free rein to run their subreddit.</p><p>The forum grew rapidly to become one of the 50 most active on Reddit, according to <a class=link href=https://pushshift.io/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Pushshift.io</a>, with tens of thousands of weekly participants and more than half a million readers a day.</p><p>But by last spring, it was having increasing problems with violations of its ‚Äú<a class=link href=https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/comments/8ezy45/an_update_for_some_of_the_rules_bad_faith/ target=_blank rel=noopener>bad-faith participation‚Äù rules</a>. The moderators found themselves shutting down dozens of conversations each week. So they decided on a bold change, one that has unleashed waves of outrage across Reddit for months.</p><p>The most heated comment threads, <a class=link href=https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/comments/bfqeee/bpt_country_club_threads/ target=_blank rel=noopener>they announced</a>, would give priority to nonwhite participants. Anyone who wished to participate would need to send the moderators a photograph of their forearm, proving they were not white.</p><p>Complaints flowed in ‚Äî from proponents of far-right ideologies, avowed liberals and many people in between. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt this just racist?‚Äù read one.</p><p>The forearm photos, according to the controversial new guidelines, had to include commenters‚Äô user names written out by hand, as well as time stamps to make clear they were recent.</p><p>‚ÄúPeople are complaining, but I have yet to figure out a better way to do it,‚Äù a black moderator whose user name is Nasjere told a reporter as he chipped away at a backlog of thousands of forearm photographs one recent afternoon, using various methods to root out fakers.</p><h2 id=brown-forearms-white-fury>Brown forearms, white fury</h2><p>Moderators, most of whom declined to give their real names, reported receiving significant abuse since they began enforcing the policy.</p><p>One user sent a stock photograph of two black men hanging from a noose, with the message, ‚ÄúLet me and my brother in we are both black.‚Äù Others compared the exclusion of white people from some conversations to <a class=link href=https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/b858zz/rblackpeopletwitter_bans_everyone_who_isnt_black/ek134yh/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Jim Crow-era</a> laws that relegated black people to second-class status in all of civic life.</p><p>There was considerable discussion about whether a photograph could demonstrate a person‚Äôs blackness, given the wide variety of skin colors among African-Americans and the complex social meanings of race that extend beyond skin color.</p><p>And the proliferation of consumer DNA tests, which break down geographic ancestry to precise percentages, prompted one critic to query:</p><p>‚ÄúMy mom is 1% Ghanaian, meaning I‚Äôm .5%. Does that count?‚Äù</p><p>Others said it was the height of hypocrisy for a forum full of discussions on combating racial injustice to exclude people on the basis of race. ‚ÄúEver heard of fighting fire with fire?‚Äù <a class=link href=https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/comments/b93w1j/rblackpeopletwitter_is_open_to_everyone_again/ek24sah/ target=_blank rel=noopener>asked the user swiper33</a>. Another user, Sunny1296, wrote, ‚ÄúConfused how it‚Äôs okay in 2019 to exclude over skin tone when we‚Äôre all the same underneath.‚Äù</p><p>Under the new rules, comments are initially open to all. But nonwhite participants are allowed to continue contentious discussions after they are closed to white users. Those threads <a class=link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/search?q=flair_name%3A%22Country%20Club%20Thread%22&restrict_sr=1" target=_blank rel=noopener>are labeled ‚ÄúCountry Club,‚Äù</a> a term the moderators said they chose in reference to a place where black people in America have historically found themselves excluded, and <a class=link href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/us/charleston-rifle-club-black-member.html?module=inline" target=_blank rel=noopener>often still do.</a></p><p>When participants who have been verified as black post a comment on any thread, <a class=link href=https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/comments/cpgtrb/black_privilege/ewqgiv8/ target=_blank rel=noopener>a check mark now appears</a> next to their username. Hispanic, Asian and other nonwhite people can also be added to a list of approved users, though they do not get a check mark.</p><p>There is one way that white people can get on the list as well: Those with a history of thoughtful participation in the subreddit can write to the moderators about what white privilege means to them.</p><p>‚ÄúWe wanted to find a way to allow actual black people to be heard without being drowned out,‚Äù said a black moderator whose Reddit user name is MGLLN. ‚ÄúWe had no idea it would blow up this site.‚Äù</p><h2 id=welcome-to-the-country-club>Welcome to the Country Club</h2><p>The idea for the Country Club threads had its genesis in an April Fools‚Äô prank that was meant to last <a class=link href=https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/comments/b82bq9/announcement_blackpeopletwitter_is_now_for_black/ target=_blank rel=noopener>just a few days</a>.</p><p>Over the previous year, the moderators had banished thousands of obvious provocateurs. Of the many users they suspected of pretending to be black, they had caught a few by researching their posts elsewhere on Reddit: ‚ÄúAs an African American male <a class=link href=https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/comments/agbqv2/meanwhile_at_the_white_house/ee5d6lx/ target=_blank rel=noopener>I would love me some Wendy‚Äôs</a>,‚Äù one user who turned out to be white wrote about the fast food President Trump served to a championship college football team at the White House. ‚ÄúWho the hell calls themselves a ‚Äòmale?‚Äô‚Äù the moderator <a class=link href=https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/comments/agbqv2/meanwhile_at_the_white_house/ee5lsop/ target=_blank rel=noopener>IceBrotha replied</a>.</p><p>More aggravating to some of the moderators were the seemingly well-meaning white participants who appeared to think their questions about police violence ‚Äî questions like ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you think it would have been different if he hadn‚Äôt resisted?‚Äù ‚Äî were original or illuminating. Or those who thought it was important, in discussing the need for <a class=link href=https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/comments/cztgp9/its_so_important_to_have_someone_that_understands/ target=_blank rel=noopener>more black doctors</a>, to suggest that it was best to ‚Äúteach your kids to look up to people regardless of skin color.‚Äù</p><p>So this spring, the moderators decided to use April Fools‚Äô Day to make a pointed joke about their frustrations, announcing that ‚Äúwe are now restricting access on this sub for <a class=link href=https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/comments/b82bq9/announcement_blackpeopletwitter_is_now_for_black/ target=_blank rel=noopener>black folks only</a>.‚Äù</p><p>It was the influx of photographs featuring forearms in all shades of brown that persuaded them to <a class=link href=https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/comments/b93w1j/rblackpeopletwitter_is_open_to_everyone_again/ target=_blank rel=noopener>make the joke rules permanent</a>.</p><p>Some black users scrawled their screen names directly on their skin. Others wrote them on paper. A handful cast aside their anonymity and sent photographs of their faces. One sent a picture of his whole family because he was light-skinned and wanted to prove he was black. Moderators worked around the clock on the first day to verify users.</p><p>And amid the ample outrage, there was also some bliss. One user, Bigg-Tech, received the black check-mark icon that signified acceptance and responded by <a class=link href=https://www.reddit.com/r/BPTmeta/comments/b92eyt/finally_got_verified/ target=_blank rel=noopener>posting a joyful dancing GIF from ‚ÄúSoul Train</a>.‚Äù</p><hr><p>Photo illustration by The New York Times</p><p>from Hacker News <a class=link href=https://ift.tt/2AVPdQ8 target=_blank rel=noopener>https://ift.tt/2AVPdQ8</a></p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-copyright><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="icon icon-tabler icon-tabler-copyright" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="2" stroke="currentcolor" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path stroke="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="9"/><path d="M14.5 9a3.5 4 0 100 6"/></svg><span>Licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</span></section></footer></article><footer class=site-footer><section class=copyright>&copy;
