certificate spamming attack against two high-profile contributors in the OpenPGP community (Robert J. Hansen and Daniel Kahn Gillmor, known in the community as &ldquo;rjh&rdquo; and &ldquo;dkg&rdquo;). This attack exploited a defect in the OpenPGP protocol in order to &ldquo;poison&rdquo; rjh and dkg&rsquo;s OpenPGP certificates. Anyone who attempts to import a poisoned certificate into a vulnerable OpenPGP installation will very likely break their installation, researchers Hansen and Gillmor haveÂ <a class=link href=https://gist.github.com/rjhansen/67ab921ffb4084c865b3618d6955275f target=_blank rel=noopener>warned</a>. Poisoned certificates have since been found on the SKS keyserver network.</p><p><strong>Global Organizations Targeted by Ryuk Ransomware</strong>Â (07/02/2019)<br>The UK&rsquo;s National Cyber Security Center (<a class=link href=http://www.ncsconline.org/ target=_blank rel=noopener>NCSC</a>) published anÂ <a class=link href=https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/ryuk-advisory target=_blank rel=noopener>advisory</a>Â to promote information regarding current Ryuk ransomware campaigns targeting organizations globally. In some cases, Emotet and Trickbot infections have also been identified on networks targeted by Ryuk. The ransomware often stays hidden until a period of time after the initial infection - ranging from days to months -which allows the actor time to carry out reconnaissance inside an infected network, identifying and targeting critical network systems and maximizing the impact of the attack.</p><p><strong>Operation Tripoli Compromised Sites Using Fake Facebook Pages to Take Aim at Libya</strong>Â (07/02/2019)<br><a class=link href=http://www.checkpoint.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Check Point Software</a>Â <a class=link href=https://research.checkpoint.com/operation-tripoli/ target=_blank rel=noopener>spotted</a>Â a large-scale campaign that for years was usingÂ <a class=link href=http://www.facebook.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Facebook</a>Â pages to spread malware across mobile and desktop environments and specifically targeted Libya. The investigation began when the researchers came across a Facebook page impersonating the commander of Libya&rsquo;s National Army, Khalifa Haftar. The research found that the attacker had been manipulating Facebook for years, compromising legitimate Web sites to host malware, and successfully hitting tens of thousands of victims mainly from Libya, but also in Europe, the United States, and Canada. The campaign has been dubbed &ldquo;Operation Tripoli.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Ratsnif Trojans in Heavy Use by OceanLotus Threat Actor</strong>Â (07/02/2019)<br>According toÂ <a class=link href=https://threatvector.cylance.com/en_us/home/threat-spotlight-ratsnif-new-network-vermin-from-oceanlotus.html target=_blank rel=noopener>analysis</a>Â fromÂ <a class=link href=https://www.cylance.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>BlackBerry Cylance</a>, the OceanLotus group is using a suite of remote access Trojans dubbed &ldquo;Ratsnif&rdquo; to leverage new network attack capabilities. The researchers have analyzed the Ratsnif Trojans, which have been under active development since 2016 and combine capabilities like packet sniffing, gateway/device Address Resolution Protocol poisoning, DNS poisoning, HTTP injection, and Media Access Control spoofing. Upon execution, Ratsnif creates a run once mutex named &ldquo;onceinstance&rdquo;, initializes Winsock version 2.2, and harvests system information to send to its attacker&rsquo;s command and control server.</p><p><strong>Sony Online Entertainment Hacker Receives Jail Sentence</strong>Â (07/09/2019)<br>Austin Thompson of Utah was sentenced to 27 months in prison for carrying out a series of denial-of-service attacks against multiple victims between 2013 and 2014, the Justice Department (<a class=link href=http://www.usdoj.gov/ target=_blank rel=noopener>DOJ</a>) announced.

The proposed fine relates to a cyber incident in September 2018. This incident in part involved user traffic to the British Airways Web site being diverted to a fraudulent site. Through this false site, customer details were harvested by the attackers and the personal data of approximately 500,000 customers was compromised. It is believed that the breach began in June 2018. The ICO&rsquo;s investigation has found that a variety of information was compromised by poor security arrangements at the company, including login, payment card, and travel booking details, names, and addresses. In addition, the ICO will hand down a Å“99.2 million ($123 million) fine to the Marriott Starwood hotel chain for a breach in which 383 million guest records were compromised. The ICO said, &ldquo;It is believed the vulnerability began when the systems of the Starwood hotels group were compromised in 2014. Marriott subsequently acquired Starwood in 2016, but the exposure of customer information was not discovered until 2018. The ICO&rsquo;s investigation found that Marriott failed to undertake sufficient due diligence when it bought Starwood and should also have done more to secure its systems.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Attackers Probe Election-Related Organizations</strong>Â (07/18/2019)<br><a class=link href=http://www.microsoft.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Microsoft</a>Â announced that its AccountGuard cyber threat detection service, which launched in August 2018, has identified 781 nation-state attacks taking aim at organizations using the service.

The settlement order imposes restrictions on Facebook&rsquo;s business operations, creates multiple channels of compliance, and requires Facebook to restructure its approach to privacy. The social media giant must establish strong mechanisms to ensure that Facebook executives are accountable for the decisions they make about privacy, and that those decisions are subject to meaningful oversight. To encourage users to share information on its platform, Facebook promises users they can control the privacy of their information through the platform&rsquo;s privacy settings. Following a year-long investigation, the FTC found that Facebook repeatedly used deceptive practices to undermine users&rsquo; privacy preferences. These tactics allowed the company to share users&rsquo; personal information with third-party apps that were downloaded by the user&rsquo;s Facebook &ldquo;friends.&rdquo; The FTC alleges that many users were unaware that Facebook was sharing such information, and therefore did not take the steps needed to opt-out of sharing. &ldquo;Despite repeated promises to its billions of users worldwide that they could control how their personal information is shared, Facebook undermined consumers&rsquo; choices,&rdquo; said FTC Chairman Joe Simons. &ldquo;The magnitude of the $5 billion penalty and sweeping conduct relief are unprecedented in the history of the FTC. The relief is designed not only to punish future violations but, more importantly, to change Facebook&rsquo;s entire privacy culture to decrease the likelihood of continued violations.&rdquo; The $5 billion penalty is the largest ever imposed on any company for violating consumers&rsquo; privacy.</p><p><strong>Former Government Contractor Gets Jail Time for Stealing Classified Data</strong>Â (07/22/2019)<br>Former National Security Agency (<a class=link href=http://www.nsa.gov/ target=_blank rel=noopener>NSA</a>) contractor Harold Martin has been sentenced to nine years in prison for stealing highly classified national defense information for almost 20 years, the Justice Department (<a class=link href=http://www.usdoj.gov/ target=_blank rel=noopener>DOJ</a>) announced.

The FTC alleges that Cambridge Analytica and two defendants, app developer Aleksandr Kogan and former Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix, deceived consumers by falsely claiming they did not collect any personally identifiable information fromÂ <a class=link href=http://www.facebook.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Facebook</a>Â users who were asked to answer survey questions and share some of their Facebook profile data. Kogan is the developer of the GSRApp that was utilized by Facebook users to answer personality-type questions. Kogan, Nix, and Cambridge Analytica used and analyzed the data collected from the app to train an algorithm to generate personality scores for the app users and their Facebook friends. Those personality scores were then matched to US voter records and used by Cambridge Analytica for voter profiling and targeted advertising services. GSRApp told users it would not download any identifiable information - only demographic data - but the FTC has said that those claims were false and the app collected Facebook User IDs, which connects individuals to their Facebook profiles, as well as other personal information such as their gender, birthdate, location, and their Facebook friends list.</p><p><strong>Legitimate WeTransfer Links Exploited to Drop Malware-Laced URLs</strong>Â (07/24/2019)<br><a class=link href=https://cofense.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Cofense</a>Â hasÂ <a class=link href=https://cofense.com/phishing-attackers-abusing-wetransfer-evade-email-gateways/ target=_blank rel=noopener>observed</a>Â a wave of phishing attacks that utilize the legitimate file hosting site WeTransfer to deliver malicious URLs to bypass email gateways.

The attack chain involves searching for exposed or publicly accessible Elasticsearch databases/servers. The malware would invoke a shell with an attacker-crafted search query with encoded Java commands. Once this is successfully carried out, the first malicious script is downloaded from a domain, which, inÂ <a class=link href=http://www.trendmicro.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Trend Micro</a>&lsquo;sÂ <a class=link href=https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/multistage-attack-delivers-billgates-setag-backdoor-can-turn-elasticsearch-databases-into-ddos-botnet-zombies/ target=_blank rel=noopener>analysis</a>, appears to be expendable or easy-to-replace. The first-stage script will attempt to shut down the firewall as well as competing and already-running cryptocurrency mining activities and other processes. The second-stage script is then retrieved, likely from a compromised Web site. Using expendable domains allows the attackers to swap URLs as soon as they are detected.</p><p><strong>Operation LagTime IT Threat Campaign Takes Aim at Asian Infrastructure</strong>Â (07/24/2019)<br><a class=link href=http://www.proofpoint.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Proofpoint</a>Â researchersÂ <a class=link href=https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/chinese-apt-operation-lagtime-it-targets-government-information-technology target=_blank rel=noopener>identified</a>Â a targeted advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign that utilized malicious RTF documents to deliver custom malware to unsuspecting victims. The campaign, dubbed &ldquo;Operation LagTime IT,&rdquo; uses spear phishing as its attack vector and a Microsoft Equation Editor zero-day bug to deliver a custom malware called Cotx RAT. Additionally, this APT group implements Poison Ivy payloads that share overlapping command and control infrastructure with the Cotx campaigns. Based on infrastructure overlaps, post-exploitation techniques, and historic tools used in this operation, Proofpoint analysts attribute this activity to the Chinese APT group known as TA428. The group has targeted government agencies in East Asia overseeing government information technology, domestic affairs, foreign affairs, economic development, and political processes.</p><p><strong>QuickBooks Cloud Host Falls Victim to Ransomware Attack</strong>Â (07/22/2019)<br><a class=link href=http://krebsonsecurity.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>KrebsOnSecurity</a>Â reported that iNSYNQ, a cloud hosting provider, was hit by a ransomware attack that left its network inaccessible and customers unable to reach their data. iNSYNQ specializes in delivering cloud-based QuickBooks accounting software and services.

The case was handled by the False Claims Act and the suit was filed in May 2011 but was not made public until July 31. James Glenn, a Cisco subcontractor who worked at NetDesign in Denmark, said he discovered security holes in the vendor&rsquo;s Video Surveillance Manager (VSM) and notified Cisco in October 2008. The flaws could have enabled attackers to take control of video surveillance cameras and potentially gain access to networks. Cisco did not fix the vulnerabilities and continued to sell the VSM package to customers, including the US government. When Cisco failed to act, Glenn filed a whistleblower case and 18 states joined in. Cisco patched the bugs in 2013 and retired the VSM package a year later.</p><p><strong>Financial Institution in Kazakhstan Is Cobalt Group&rsquo;s New Target</strong>Â (08/01/2019)<br>The Cobalt Group cybercriminal actor has taken aim at a bank in Kazakhstan with a decoy document thatÂ <a class=link href=http://www.checkpoint.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Check Point Software</a>Â researchersÂ <a class=link href=https://research.checkpoint.com/cobalt-group-returns-to-kazakhstan/ target=_blank rel=noopener>say</a>Â may have been lifted from the bank&rsquo;s actual Web site.

By using warshipping, the scientists could infiltrate a network without being detected. Warshipping involves the use of disposable, low-cost, and low-power computers to remotely perform close-proximity attacks, regardless of a cybercriminal&rsquo;s location. A malicious actor can hide a tiny device (similar to the size of a small cellphone) in a package and ship it off to his or her victim to gain access to a specific network. The device, a 3G-enabled, remotely controlled system, can be tucked into the bottom of a packaging box or stuffed inside an item as it is no bigger than the palm of a hand.</p><p><strong>Advisory Details Password Spraying Attacks Targeting Various Services</strong>Â (08/07/2019)<br>The Australian Cyber Security Center (<a class=link href=https://www.cyber.gov.au/ target=_blank rel=noopener>ACSC</a>) isÂ <a class=link href=https://www.cyber.gov.au/publications/advisory-2019-130-password-spray-attacks-detection-and-mitigation-strategies target=_blank rel=noopener>aware</a>Â of a high volume of ongoing password spray attacks targeting Australian organizations. The password spray attacks target users on standard corporate external services such as Webmail, remote desktop access, Active Directory Federated Services, or cloud based services such as Office 365. Depending on the credentials and service, successful authentication can potentially lead to the actor gaining access to corporate emails, the corporate directory, global address books, remote desktop services or administrative access.

The crime was perpetrated by Pakistani citizen Muhammad Fahd, who bribed staff at a Bothell, Washington AT&T call center in order to have carrier-locked smartphones unlocked from the AT&T network before the company&rsquo;s policy would normally allow it. While this act is already considered criminal, the much more concerning aspect of the incident may be the fact that Fahd also paid AT&T staff to insert malware and &ldquo;otherwise misuse&rdquo; the AT&T network for his personal gain. In exchange for facilitating his criminal activity, the participating workers at the call center were bribed to the tune of $428,500 over a five-year period. The numerous charges against Fahd include wire fraud, five charges incidents of Travel Act violations, conspiracy to violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse act, and four counts linked of accessing and damaging protected computers.

By analyzing NetFlow data between December 2018 and June, the researchers found that 28.1% of the cloud environments surveyed had at least one fully established network connection with at least one known Rocke command and control domain. Several of those organizations maintained near daily connections. Meanwhile, 20% of the organizations maintained hourly heartbeats consistent with Rocke tactics, techniques, and procedures. Rocke also released a new backdoor called Godlua, which could function as an agent, allowing the group&rsquo;s actors to perform additional scripted operations, including denial-of-service attacks, network proxying, and two shell capabilities.

The investigation showed that the threat actor had used these devices to gain initial access to corporate networks. In two of the cases, the passwords for the devices were deployed without changing the default manufacturer&rsquo;s passwords, and in the third instance the latest security update had not been applied to the device. After gaining access to each of the IoT devices, the actor ran tcpdump to sniff network traffic on local subnets and enumerated administrative groups for further exploitative purposes. As the actor moved from one device to another, they would drop a simple shell script to establish persistence on the network which allowed extended access to continue hunting.</p><p><strong>Cryptocurrency Theft Rises, Despite Increased Security Measures</strong>Â (08/15/2019)<br>Cybersecurity research firmÂ <a class=link href=https://ciphertrace.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>CipherTrace</a>Â found that cryptocurrency theft is on the rise, despite increased security measures by many sites and exchanges.

Specifically, the article&rsquo;s sources claim the company helped authorities in Uganda intercept encrypted messages and allowed police in Zambia to locate opposition bloggers. Huawei&rsquo;s alleged participation ranged from the provision of Israeli malware to tapping phones and illegally accessing political opponents&rsquo; Facebook pages. Perhaps surprisingly, both governments readily confirmed that they are working with Huawei, but both framed their efforts as combating &ldquo;fake news,&rdquo; rather than suppressing communications from sources with views that differ from their own.</p><p><strong>Kaspersky Study Examines OT/ICS Incidents</strong>Â (08/21/2019)<br><a class=link href=http://www.kaspersky.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Kaspersky Lab</a>Â hasÂ <a class=link href=https://usa.kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/2019_survey-finds-over-half-of-industrial-networks-cybersecurity-incidents-occur-due-to-employee-errors target=_blank rel=noopener>published</a>Â a new study in which it reported that 52 percent of OT/ICS (operational technology and industrial control system) networks incidents were due to &ldquo;employee errors&rdquo; or &ldquo;unintentional actions.&rdquo; TheÂ <a class=link href=https://ics.kaspersky.com/the-state-of-industrial-cybersecurity-2019/ target=_blank rel=noopener>State of Industrial Cybersecurity 2019</a>Â report found this issue to primarily be the result of the growing complexity of industrial infrastructure, as well as a general shortage of professionals who understand how to detect new threats.</p><p><strong>Ransomware Attack Impacts Two Texas Cities</strong>Â (08/22/2019)<br>The cities of Borger and Keene, Texas became two of the latest municipalities to fall victim to a ransomware attack,Â <a class=link href=http://www.sophos.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Sophos</a>Â reported. In total, 22 departments within the two local governments were affected by the attack. Apparently the attackers demanded $2.5 million to restore the government&rsquo;s access to its systems.

The threat group, which may have first become active in April 2018, targets organizations in sectors of strategic national importance, including oil and gas and possibly telecommunications. Its activity is similar to other groups, including OilRig and Elfin, but the researchers suspect this is a new entity entirely. This new group has been dubbed &ldquo;Hexane&rdquo; (also known as LYCEUM) and typically accesses an organization using account credentials obtained via password spraying or brute-force attacks. Using compromised accounts, the threat actors send spearphishing emails with malicious Excel attachments to deliver the DanBot malware, which subsequently deploys post-intrusion tools.</p><p><strong>FTC Reminds Consumers to Be Wary of Romance Scams</strong>Â (08/27/2019)<br>Consumers should be aware of romance scams that are finding their way into inboxes.

Since those advisories were published, the NCSC, NSA, and partner-shared analysis of additional victims and infrastructure determined the Neuron and Nautilus tools were very likely Iranian in origin. Those behind Neuron or Nautilus were almost certainly not aware of, or complicit with, Turla&rsquo;s use of their implants. After acquiring the tools and the data needed to use them operationally, Turla first tested them against victims they had already compromised using their Snake toolkit, and then deployed the Iranian tools directly to additional victims.</p><p><strong>Texas Man Receives 12+ Years in Prison for Phishing LA Superior Court</strong>Â (10/24/2019)<br>A Texas man who was found guilty of hacking into the Los Angeles Superior Court (LASC) computer system, using the system to send approximately two million malicious phishing emails, and fraudulently obtaining hundreds of credit card numbers was sentenced to 145 months in federal prison.

The agency raided two businesses and several homes in Mira Mesa and Mission Hills, California, seizing over $250,000 in cash and 90 iPhones that may include counterfeit parts. Apparently, the operation revolved around acquiring counterfeit iPhone and iPads from China, importing them to the US, and then intentionally breaking those devices and having them replaced, under warranty, byÂ <a class=link href=http://www.apple.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Apple</a>, with genuine iPhones and iPads. The legitimate units were then being returned to China for sale. The crime was allegedly perpetrated by three brothers, Zhiwei Loop Liao, Zhimin Liao, and Zhiting Liao, all of whom are considered fugitives at the time of writing. An additional 11 individuals have been charged in the case, which is believed to have moved more than 10,000 iPhones and iPads during its time in operation.

The case involves two legitimate companies - a Chinese venture capital fund and an Israeli startup - and a wire transfer. After realizing the theft, the startup tapped Check Point for help. Upon analysis, Check Point determined that the attacker had spotted the correspondence between the two companies ahead of the anticipated wire transfer and set up two lookalike domains to resemble the legitimate companies. The attacker then began corresponding with both the venture capital fund and the startup, spoofing the email addresses of each company. Check Point&rsquo;s Matan Ben David said, &ldquo;This infrastructure gave the attacker the ability to conduct the ultimate Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attack.
