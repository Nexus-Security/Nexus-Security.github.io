On the surface, it can seem like jotting down the important points or stating everything word for word. But delving into the world of note-taking begins a realization that there is more to it than that. So if you feel like your note skills are rusty, or if you didn&rsquo;t care much about note-taking, here are some strategies to help you prepare and succeed in this area.</p><h2 id=what-to-do-before-note-taking>What to Do Before Note Taking</h2><p>There are all kinds of strategies and systems in place to be taking notes. Some are more formal methods for taking notes while others are strategies that have helped others in the past. But before jumping into note-taking techniques, there are some things to consider prior to learning:</p><h4 id=adopt-a-note-taking-mindset>Adopt a Note Taking Mindset</h4><p>Even our attitude and behavior plays a factor in our ability to take notes. For example, snacks with high sugar or high salt will impact our ability to pay attention to. This also applies to coffee which - if not consumed in moderation - can impact sleep and your ability to pay attention and focus as well. In this regard, we can see already how mood can impact our ability to take notes. If we‚Äôre not focused or easily distracted, we will have a tougher time putting together accurate notes. But that is a more extreme case. If you‚Äôre someone who doesn‚Äôt drink coffee or has a snack before class, attitude can still play a significant role. Think back to classes that you weren‚Äôt that excited for or that you were bad at. The only reason those topics are not your strong suit can be chalked up to your attitude. Think about it: The topics you excelled at made you feel good and you had a vested interest in. This is no different from other pursuits in your life. Compared to things you lack interest in, it‚Äôs clear that you would make no effort to learn about something that you don‚Äôt want. So attitude makes a difference and this logic can be applied to even topics you‚Äôre not big on. All you need to do is have a positive attitude, pay attention, and study with a classmate or two.</p><h4 id=preparing-before-class>Preparing Before Class</h4><p>First, if you are taking a formal course, it pays to be prepared. One study by Spies and Wilkin((AJPE: <a class=link href=https://www.ajpe.org/doi/full/10.5688/aj680248 target=_blank rel=noopener>Effect of Pre-class Preparation of Legal Cases on In-class Performance</a> )) found that law students who read a legal case before getting to class displayed deeper understanding of the material compared to others. This doesn‚Äôt apply to courses where you are assigned reading but in all manner of courses. With plenty of information made available at our fingertips, there is a lot of opportunities for us to learn about the subject before a course or a training session. This will pay off for you as you‚Äôll spend more time focusing on understanding the tougher aspects of a topic rather than absorbing the information as is.</p><h2 id=7-note-taking-techniques-for-effective-learning>7 Note Taking Techniques for Effective Learning</h2><p>In Miami University&rsquo;s public database, there is a course outlining note-taking and active listening ((MiaMioh: <a class=link href=https://miamioh.instructure.com/courses/62085/pages/note-taking-styles target=_blank rel=noopener>Note Taking Styles - Miami University</a>)). These particular methods are some of the more popular methods for taking notes.</p><h3 id=1-the-outline-method>1. The Outline Method</h3><p>This method is used for simplicity and is one of the easiest methods of taking notes. Anyone can pick up this method and use it with no issues. When using this method, the idea is to <strong>select four or five key points that are going to be covered in a specific lesson</strong>. Under those key points, you write more in-depth sub-points based on what is being discussed on those topics. The idea with this form of note taking is so it doesn‚Äôt overwhelm you. But you‚Äôll pay attention in a different manner. In the case of this approach, if you know what‚Äôs being discussed, you‚Äôll focus on the important aspects of that topic rather than wonder what‚Äôs coming up next. Use this method in cases where:</p><ul><li>You want your notes to be organized from the start.</li><li>To see the relationships between both topics and subtopics.</li><li>You want to convert the points into questions to quiz yourself on later.</li></ul><h3 id=2-the-cornell-method>2. The Cornell Method</h3><p>Developed in the 1950s by Cornell University, this is the most common note taking method around. In fact, the outline method is likely inspired by this method as there are similarities to it. In this method, you are still using key points, but this method goes deeper into the organizing method. For one, the page is broken into three sections:</p><ul><li><strong>a narrow column called the ‚Äúcue‚Äù</strong></li><li><strong>a wider column for your actual notes</strong></li><li><strong>a summary at the bottom</strong></li></ul><p>The cue section is the section where you fill out main points, people, potential test questions and more. This section is devoted to helping you recall larger topics and ideas. The note section is devoted to expanding and explaining those cue points. You still want to summarize them to an extent using headings. When getting into specifics, you want to indent them and use a numbering system, either roman numerals, numbers, or letters. The summary section is the section you write up at the end summarizing all of the information in a clear sentence or two. You want both the summary and the cue to be simple seeing as your notes are where you want all of the details. Here&rsquo;s an example illustrated by Comprehension Hart:((COMPREHENSION STRATEGIES: <a class=link href=http://comprehensionhart.weebly.com/cornell-notes.html target=_blank rel=noopener>Cornell Notes</a>)) <a class=link href=https://cdn.lifehack.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/cornessl-method.png target=_blank rel=noopener><img src=https://cdn.lifehack.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/cornessl-method.png loading=lazy></a> This method is great if you:</p><ul><li>Want notes to be organized even further and easier to review.</li><li>Want to pull out major ideas and concepts quickly.</li></ul><h3 id=3-mind-mapping-method>3. Mind Mapping Method</h3><p>Mind mapping is a method that works for subjects that have interlocking topics or complex and abstract ideas. Chemistry, history, and philosophy are examples where this method shines. The use of the map is to serve as a visual aid for how every topic is related to one another. It also allows you to go into detail on particular ideas or topics. An example of this at work is looking at the French Revolution. First, you‚Äôd start with that concept at the center and then begin branching off that led to events, and people that sparked the French Revolution. You can <strong>start off with broad general ideas</strong> and during the course or when you are reviewing, you can <strong>add in sub-concepts to those branches</strong>. Things like dates, support facts, concepts that you see between people and events. That being said, this method doesn‚Äôt apply to¬† only those kinds of topics. Any kind of topic that you can break into various points can also help as well. Another example can be talking about different forms of learning and using the nodes to discuss each method and what each one is like. Learn more about this method here: <a class=link href=https://www.lifehack.org/articles/work/how-to-mind-map-in-three-small-steps.html target=_blank rel=noopener>How to Mind Map: Visualize Your Cluttered Thoughts in 3 Simple Steps</a> This type of method for note taking is great for:</p><ul><li><a class=link href=https://www.lifehack.org/791669/how-to-use-visual-learning target=_blank rel=noopener>Visual learners</a> who struggle with studying via notes.</li><li>For people who need to remember and connect relationships, and events with topics.</li></ul><h3 id=4-flow-notes-method>4. Flow Notes Method</h3><p>Discussed in a post in College Info Geek,((College Info Geek: <a class=link href=https://collegeinfogeek.com/how-to-take-notes-in-college/ target=_blank rel=noopener>How To Take Better Notes: The 6 Best Note-Taking Systems</a>)) this method is for those who want to maximize active learning in the classroom and save time in reviewing. The idea of flow notes is to treat yourself as a student rather than transcribing word for word. In this method, you‚Äôll <strong>jot down topics, then start drawing arrows, make doodles, diagrams and graphs to get a general idea out there</strong>. This method also helps in drawing other bridges and form connections in various fields or within the subject. If some information reminds you of another piece of information or technique, make a note and jot it down. Take a look at this video to learn a bit more about this method: <a class=link href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?time target=_blank rel=noopener>https://www.youtube.com/watch?time</a>_continue=286&v=uL_YjcGoszo&feature=emb_logo The only catch with this method is that while it‚Äôs great for learning at that moment, you may have a tough time reviewing them later. You may want to pair this method with another method mentioned above.</p><h3 id=5-the-sentence-method>5. The Sentence Method</h3><p>Another simple method and is a lesser version of flow notes. The idea with this is a simple note-taking. You‚Äôre <strong>jotting down everything that‚Äôs being said to the best of your ability</strong>. It‚Äôs genuine transcription at it‚Äôs finest. The problem with this method is that it can be tough to keep up with everything else that‚Äôs happening. If you‚Äôre writing notes by hand, you will definitely be missing key points and ideas. On a computer, you may be able to keep up, however, you may face challenges still. Despite those problems, there are still advantages to this method. Compared to every other method, this provides the most details and information for review:</p><ul><li>You can still be brief by covering the main points.</li><li>Your notes are already simplified for you to study and review them immediately.</li></ul><h3 id=6-charting-method>6. Charting Method</h3><p>Charting notes take the Cornell method and divide a sheet into three columns. Similar to the mind mapping method, this helps you in connecting relationships and facts together between topics. This method is a lazier method than the other ones mentioned above but works for the people who want to <strong>highlight key pieces of information on various topics and want to organize facts</strong> for easy review.</p><h3 id=7-writing-on-slides>7. Writing on Slides</h3><p>The final method is another strategy for people who can‚Äôt be bothered to take extensive notes. This method works well particularly in classes where the instructor provides slides that they‚Äôre using for their lectures. Whether it‚Äôs a handout or you can download them online, all you need to do is <strong>print them off and start writing away on them</strong>. This method is great because it removes a lot of the worry of taking general notes. Since ideas and concepts are already discussed, it‚Äôs a matter of expanding those notes already.</p><h2 id=what-note-taking-techniques-are-the-best>What Note Taking Techniques Are the Best?</h2><p>As you may have noticed, each method is good in its own situation. Depending on what you‚Äôre learning - and your own preferences - each method has advantages. It‚Äôs also worth noting that every person learns and studies in a different manner. With this in mind, consider how you study and figure out the method that best compliments it.</p><h2 id=more-about-learning-fast>More About Learning Fast</h2><ul><li><a class=link href=https://www.lifehack.org/851922/self-directed-learning target=_blank rel=noopener>13 Ways to Develop Self-Directed¬†Learning¬†and¬†Learn¬†Faster</a></li><li><a class=link href=https://www.lifehack.org/849858/how-to-learn-effectively target=_blank rel=noopener>How to¬†Learn¬†Fast and Remember More: 5 Effective Techniques</a></li><li><a class=link href=https://www.lifehack.org/850924/learning-methods target=_blank rel=noopener>Essential¬†Learning¬†Methods to Help You¬†Learn¬†Effectively</a></li></ul><p>from Lifehack - Feed <a class=link href=https://ift.tt/2Xm1ZSG target=_blank rel=noopener>https://ift.tt/2Xm1ZSG</a><br>via <a class=link href="https://ifttt.com/?ref=da&site=blogger" target=_blank rel=noopener>IFTTT</a></p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-copyright><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="icon icon-tabler icon-tabler-copyright" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="2" stroke="currentcolor" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path stroke="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="9"/><path d="M14.5 9a3.5 4 0 100 6"/></svg><span>Licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</span></section></footer></article><footer class=site-footer><section class=copyright>&copy;
