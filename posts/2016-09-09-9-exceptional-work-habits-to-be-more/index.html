tendencies you apply in achieving peak performance in your business or workplace. Good work habits establish a solid foundation for peak performance, efficiency, trust, effective communication, regular attendance, compliance, time management, punctuality, and collaboration. Have you ever extended your job functions and duties to assist your colleagues in a bid to achieve team efficiency and productivity? If yes, you possess good work habits. But that&rsquo;s not all. Successful people understand they need to display exceptional work habits to stand out. Here are 7 of such habits with two bonus-tips on setting priorities:</p><h2 id=1-prioritize-your-mit>1. Prioritize Your MIT</h2><p>Your MIT here means your <a class=link href=https://www.lifehack.org/articles/featured/50-tricks-to-get-things-done-faster-better-and-more-easily.html target=_blank rel=noopener>&lsquo;Most Important Tasks&rsquo;</a>. <strong>It‚Äôs not enough to have a to-do list; you need to establish your Most Important Tasks.</strong> The concept behind prioritizing your MIT is predicated on the fact that some activities are more crucial than others. Therefore, checking off the items on your to-do list might not be enough, as you may end up completing both important and less important tasks. So what&rsquo;s your best approach? Spend some minutes in picking 1 to 3 MITs- the tasks you need to complete before the day ends no matter what. You can then channel your energy on what matters with a renewed focus, as you know they must be completed. Here&rsquo;s what Laura Earnest, a productivity blogger, said about the significance of establishing your MITs as a work habit:((LauraEarnest: <a class=link href=http://lauraearnest.com/limiting-tasks-to-get-more-done/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Limiting Tasks To Get More Done</a>))</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Productive people focus on the most important activities. They also ensure the means of getting those tasks done are the most effective. I believe they possess the capabilities of discerning the most important tasks and are apt in delegating the less important.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><h2 id=2-limit-social-media-use>2. Limit Social Media Use</h2><p>With emails, notifications from social media platforms, and several minor to-dos, you can easily get distracted while trying to engage in productive work. Our Editor-in-chief of Lifehack.org, <a class=link href=https://www.lifehack.org/author/anna-chui target=_blank rel=noopener>Anna Chui</a>, talked about the work habits that help her get ahead in life and business. Here&rsquo;s what she said about limiting social media use:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I limit my social media and IM usage so I can stay focused on what&rsquo;s important to me. I turn off all WhatsApp group notifications and check them only before work, during lunchtime, and after work. I also turn off all social media notifications, so I don&rsquo;t get distracted in the middle of my work. I go on social media only after work and limit time to less than 30 min per day.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p><a class=link href=https://www.lifehack.org/articles/featured/managing-your-social-network-addiction.html target=_blank rel=noopener>Limiting social media usage</a> is a good work habit that can impact how you manage your time and what you make out of it.</p><h2 id=3-be-open-to-feedback>3. Be Open to Feedback</h2><p>The feedback system is a tool to optimize your efficiency in the workplace. When you receive positive or negative feedback from your superordinate, don&rsquo;t take it personally. <a class=link href=https://www.lifehack.org/articles/work/8-ways-receive-feedback-and-turn-them-into-your-strengths.html target=_blank rel=noopener>The goal of feedback</a> is to make you more productive. Here&rsquo;s what Elijah Falode, a Top-rated content writer on Upwork, said on how he manages feedback from clients:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I understand the significance of both public and private feedback on my reputation and work. To deliver a quality job, I spend more time to understand my client&rsquo;s requirement, and then I ask questions. Once the client request for revision, I quickly work on it and ensure the client&rsquo;s requirement has been met, and he or she is satisfied. Each feedback helps me to improve on the job.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><h2 id=4-exercise-daily>4. Exercise Daily</h2><p>You may ask me what exercise has got to do with work habits. The truth is they are correlated. Your physical disposition affects personal productivity. This is why exercise will rank high on the list of exceptional work habits. Several studies have pointed out that physical exercise is one of the essential work habits you need if you want to be healthier and live a happier life. Exercise will help you achieve quality sleep, optimized memory, mental alertness, and better concentration. You can&rsquo;t accomplish this with a sedentary lifestyle. It will even impact your financial life. According to the Journal of Labor Research, those who exercise daily were discovered to earn about nine percent on the average than those who live a sedentary life.((ResearchGate: <a class=link href=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228209063_The_Effect_of_Exercise_on_Earnings_Evidence_from_the_NLSY target=_blank rel=noopener>The Effect of Exercise on Earnings: Evidence from the NLSY</a>))</p><h2 id=5-make-healthy-choices>5. Make Healthy Choices</h2><p>If you continuously make some unhealthy choices, the truth is it will not only impact your mind and body negatively, but it will also affect your professional success. Therefore, <a class=link href=https://www.lifehack.org/789819/healthy-lifestyle-tips target=_blank rel=noopener>making healthy choices is a crucial work habit</a>. Here is how to make informed choices:</p><ul><li>Write down those daily activities that add value to your health to assess your lifestyles.</li><li>List those habits that you think are hazardous to your health.</li><li><a class=link href=https://www.lifehack.org/673363/healthy-habits-that-will-improve-your-overall-well-being-and-make-you-feel-good target=_blank rel=noopener>Select one of the healthy habits</a> and devise a plan to increase it. For instance, if you read for 30 minutes daily, increase it to 60 minutes daily.</li><li>Pick one of the unhealthy choices and plan how to decrease it. For instance, if you are always tempted to taking soda by 4 pm every day to boost your energy, switch to taking herbal tea or water.</li><li>Select one of the <a class=link href=https://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/15-bad-habits-which-always-destroy-your-productivity.html target=_blank rel=noopener>bad work habits</a> and substitute them with <a class=link href=https://www.lifehack.org/articles/work/10-habits-people-who-are-highly-successful-work.html target=_blank rel=noopener>good work habits</a>. For instance, if you browse social media immediately, you wake up in the morning, replace that habit with a yoga exercise or early morning meditation.</li><li>Evaluate your achievement every weekend. If you are not making progress, find out what&rsquo;s the issue and adjust, so you don&rsquo;t repeat the same mistake.</li></ul><h2 id=6-engage-in-reflective-practice>6. Engage in Reflective Practice</h2><p>Reflection is a habit of reflecting on your ideas, thoughts, and actions in a bid to engage in a life-long learning process. It is also paying rapt attention to the values that inform your daily habits. Reflective practice helps you in cultivating vital skills and evaluating your effectiveness instead of going with the flow. It enables you to find out the motives behind your actions and curate a better approach in doing them subsequently. Bren√© Brown is a research professor at the University of Houston. She spends most of her time studying courage, vulnerability, shame, and authenticity. She recommended you:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Talk to yourself like someone you respect, with tough love and honesty.‚Äù</p></blockquote><p>Meanwhile, most people are limited by the outcomes of that endeavor. Radical honesty demands standing in your resolution. This act of honesty will also enable you to make the right decisions, communicate better, and learn.((Psychologies.co.uk: <a class=link href=https://www.psychologies.co.uk/bren%C3%A9-brown-self-reflection target=_blank rel=noopener>Bren√© Brown on self-reflection</a>)) Create a work habit by dedicating some time to ask the following questions:</p><ul><li>Am I organized? Do I recall things?</li><li>Am I focused or get easily distracted? Do I need to reinforce a work habit/</li><li>Which of my skills stands out?</li><li>What are the challenges facing?</li><li>What distractions or tasks may impact my profession or career?</li><li>What impact am I making?</li><li>What makes me happy?</li><li>How do I want to improve every aspect of my life?</li></ul><p>Reflective practice is a work habit that can help you achieve happiness in your personal and professional life.((Medium: <a class=link href=https://medium.com/@elijahfalode89/what-you-need-to-know-about-reflective-practice-d34725513834 target=_blank rel=noopener>What You Need To Know About Reflective Practice</a>))</p><h2 id=7-find-time-to-recharge>7. Find Time To Recharge</h2><p>Your energy carries the same level of importance as your time. It does not make sense having enough time with no energy to remain productive. Yes! It&rsquo;s good to prioritize and also apply some productivity tactics.¬†But you also need to learn how to take care of yourself. Highly effective leaders find time to recharge. This means they get sufficient sleep each night. They also exercise and eat healthily. If you are finding it difficult to concentrate on the job, evaluate your work habits. Jeff Bezos said of getting good sleep:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I prioritize it. I think better and have more energy.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Bezos advocates for eight hours of good sleep. He said,((Business Insider: <a class=link href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-bezos-why-8-hours-sleep-important-when-making-important-decisions-2018-9?IR=T" target=_blank rel=noopener>Jeff Bezos explains why he thinks getting 8 hours of sleep is key to making important decisions in the workplace</a>))</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;If you shortchange good sleep, you may win some additional productive hours, but that productivity will remain an illusion. Quality matters than quantity when it comes to decisions and interactions.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><h2 id=8employ-the-eisenhower-matrix-to-track-long-term-priorities>8.¬†Employ the Eisenhower Matrix to Track Long-Term Priorities</h2><p>Sometimes, while trying to be productive, you focus on the short term. However, Peter Drucker, the renowned management legend, affirmed that:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;There is nothing as useless as efficiently performing activities that deserve no attention at all.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>The Eisenhower Matrix, utilized by Dwilight Eisenhower in making informed decisions while he was a general, was popularized in The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People written by Stephen Covey. This matrix assists you in determining the tasks you should work on and those you should ignore. Do you want to create your Eisenhower Matrix now? Here&rsquo;s how to go about it:((Eisenhower Matrix: <a class=link href=https://www.techtello.com/eisenhower-productivity-matrix/ target=_blank rel=noopener>How to Prioritise and Master Productivity</a>)) <a class=link href=https://cdn.lifehack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Eisenhower-Matrix.png target=_blank rel=noopener><img src=https://cdn.lifehack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Eisenhower-Matrix.png loading=lazy></a> Are you working on urgent tasks that are not important? Devise the means of delegating, automating, or eliminating those tasks. Are you engaged in activities that are not important and urgent? Then ignore those tasks! The Eisenhower Matrix simplifies the establishment of priorities.</p><h2 id=9-utilize-the-8020-rule>9. Utilize the 80/20 rule</h2><p>You need to focus on the most significant tasks. <a class=link href=https://www.lifehack.org/840576/what-is-the-80-20-rule target=_blank rel=noopener>The 80/20 principle</a> is an excellent approach to prioritize your tasks. Vilfredo Pareto, an Italian economist, discovered the principle. It is popularly known as the Pareto principle. According to this principle,</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;80% of your results emanate from 20% of your efforts.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>To develop a good work habit, you need to discover the most rewarding 20% of your activities. Then, devise the means of reducing the 80% of your schedule. This will create more time for you to focus on the most impactful activities.</p><h2 id=final-thoughts>Final Thoughts</h2><p>Highly exceptional people may seem like robots. Sometimes, they have only learned how to prioritize their tasks, surmount challenges, and overcome procrastination. Good work habits are crucial to achieving optimal performance in every aspect of your life. A client gives you a 5-star for quality performance, but he or she does not rate others the same way. Managers and business colleagues will love to collaborate with you when you possess exceptional work habits. Productive work habits will make you stand out in your business and workplace. Clients will value you for your efficiency and hard work Exceptional people are not brilliant than the rest of the world &ndash; they have only developed work habits that make them stand out from the rest of the world.</p><p>from Lifehack - Feed <a class=link href=https://ift.tt/36F66fw target=_blank rel=noopener>https://ift.tt/36F66fw</a><br>via <a class=link href="https://ifttt.com/?ref=da&site=blogger" target=_blank rel=noopener>IFTTT</a></p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-copyright><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="icon icon-tabler icon-tabler-copyright" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="2" stroke="currentcolor" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path stroke="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="9"/><path d="M14.5 9a3.5 4 0 100 6"/></svg><span>Licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</span></section></footer></article><footer class=site-footer><section class=copyright>&copy;
