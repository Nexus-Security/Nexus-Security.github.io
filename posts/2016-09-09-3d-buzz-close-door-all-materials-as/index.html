Perhaps you want to create concept art, or simply create for your own pleasure. Whether you&rsquo;re working with 2D or 3D art, it&rsquo;s important to have a grounding in the rules and basic techniques.</p><p>With that in mind, we asked Derek Stevens to create a series that anyone can follow. Our goal is to help you see the world, both inner and outer, by the rules of art. Over the course of the next two hours, Derek will demonstrate bringing your visions to life. From simple shapes to still life and perspective, all you have to do is follow the rules. And of course, remember how to get to Carnegie Hall. Practice, practice, practice!</p><ol><li>art-101-part-01.zip</li></ol><h3 id=2d-game-art-for-non-artists-free>2D Game Art for Non-Artists (free)</h3><p>In this series, Steve Curtis is going to demonstrate how to harness the power of Photoshop to get beautiful 2D art work for games, even if you’ve never created art before. This is High-Rez art designed to look like modern graphics but with that old school feel. Although it isn’t pixel art, the graphics created could certainly be sized down to create art that has that pixel art feel. This course uses Photoshop, however GIMP and similar programs should suffice. No tablet is required, all of the art in this series was created using only a mouse.</p><p>We will create beautiful cartoon art with a modern edge, and harness light and shading techniques to give our work depth.</p><ol><li>2d-game-art-for-nonartists-part-01.zip</li></ol><h3 id=3ds-max---legacy-video-training>3Ds Max - Legacy Video Training</h3><p>The Legacy Series is an archive of older videos created as free content from throughout the history of 3D Buzz.

These videos have been provided here as a way for you access some of 3D Buzz&rsquo;s earlier content, though it is also helpful to those who have opted out of updating to the most recent version of a particular software package.</p><ol><li>legacy-series-3ds-max-part-01.zip</li><li>legacy-series-3ds-max-part-02.zip</li></ol><h3 id=3ds-max-101>3ds Max 101</h3><p>Throughout this live class, students will be introduced to 3ds Max from the standpoint of the beginner by following techniques Mark Gerhard used to create the cut-scene of a train wreck for an Iphone game called “The Adventures of Marshal Marshmallow” . He will use the steam engine as an example for modeling, and teach the techniques used for the explosions and various effects in the scene. The focus of the class is an understanding how to use and navigate this power program and get you started on your way to your own 3D creations!</p><ol><li>3ds-max-101-part-01.zip</li><li>3ds-max-101-part-02.zip</li></ol><h3 id=3ds-max-how-do-i>3DS Max: How do I?</h3><p>The “How Do I?” series is a collection of short tip-based videos covering very specific topics in a given application. The topics themselves were sent in or collected from users across the internet, and we in turn create a video which answers the question as concisely as possible. These videos are a great way to pick up little tips and tricks, or just as a way to get to know aspects of an application with which you may not yet be familiar.</p><ol><li>how-do-i-3ds-max-part-01.zip</li></ol><h3 id=3ds-max-modeling-on-the-fly---at-at>3Ds Max: Modeling on the Fly - AT-AT</h3><p>Modeling on the Fly is a live video approach to modeling training.

Then you&rsquo;re going to need a way to make your games &ldquo;smarter.&rdquo; Artificial intelligence is one of the core elements of any modern day game production. Convincing your players that their adversary is actually thinking and considering the situation goes a long way toward making your gaming environments more believable. In this new XNA series from 3D Buzz, we take you through your first steps at developing your own game AI systems through the implementation of a simple weighted behavior system.</p><ol><li>ai-programming-behavior-systems-part-01.zip</li></ol><h3 id=ai-programming-pathfinding-with-a>AI Programming: Pathfinding with A*</h3><p>Welcome to &ldquo;A* Pathfinding&rdquo; the second set in our AI Programming series. This entry in the series continues from the topics discussed in &ldquo;Behavior Systems&rdquo; by exploring the world of pathfinding focusing primarily on the A* pathfinding algorithm. Pathfinding is the process of plotting out the shortest or most efficient path between two given points. A* (pronounced ay-star) is a particular pathfinding search algorithm used in many software applications for calculating this path. In determining the path, the A* algorithm takes a &ldquo;distance-to-goal + path-cost&rdquo; score into consideration.</p><ol><li>ai-programming-behavior-systems-part-01.zip</li><li>ai-programming-part-01.zip</li></ol><h3 id=app-development-with-aspnet-mvc>App Development with ASP.net MVC</h3><p>I’m thrilled to be able to announce that our new programming training series for our Member Sponsors, ‘Web Development with ASP.net,’ is now available for streaming here on 3D Buzz!
