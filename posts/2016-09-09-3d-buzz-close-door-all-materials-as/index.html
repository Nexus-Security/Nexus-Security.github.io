Perhaps you want to create concept art, or simply create for your own pleasure. Whether you&rsquo;re working with 2D or 3D art, it&rsquo;s important to have a grounding in the rules and basic techniques.</p><p>With that in mind, we asked Derek Stevens to create a series that anyone can follow. Our goal is to help you see the world, both inner and outer, by the rules of art. Over the course of the next two hours, Derek will demonstrate bringing your visions to life. From simple shapes to still life and perspective, all you have to do is follow the rules. And of course, remember how to get to Carnegie Hall. Practice, practice, practice!</p><ol><li>art-101-part-01.zip</li></ol><h3 id=2d-game-art-for-non-artists-free>2D Game Art for Non-Artists (free)</h3><p>In this series, Steve Curtis is going to demonstrate how to harness the power of Photoshop to get beautiful 2D art work for games, even if you’ve never created art before. This is High-Rez art designed to look like modern graphics but with that old school feel. Although it isn’t pixel art, the graphics created could certainly be sized down to create art that has that pixel art feel. This course uses Photoshop, however GIMP and similar programs should suffice. No tablet is required, all of the art in this series was created using only a mouse.</p><p>We will create beautiful cartoon art with a modern edge, and harness light and shading techniques to give our work depth.</p><ol><li>2d-game-art-for-nonartists-part-01.zip</li></ol><h3 id=3ds-max---legacy-video-training>3Ds Max - Legacy Video Training</h3><p>The Legacy Series is an archive of older videos created as free content from throughout the history of 3D Buzz.

Then you&rsquo;re going to need a way to make your games &ldquo;smarter.&rdquo; Artificial intelligence is one of the core elements of any modern day game production. Convincing your players that their adversary is actually thinking and considering the situation goes a long way toward making your gaming environments more believable. In this new XNA series from 3D Buzz, we take you through your first steps at developing your own game AI systems through the implementation of a simple weighted behavior system.</p><ol><li>ai-programming-behavior-systems-part-01.zip</li></ol><h3 id=ai-programming-pathfinding-with-a>AI Programming: Pathfinding with A*</h3><p>Welcome to &ldquo;A* Pathfinding&rdquo; the second set in our AI Programming series. This entry in the series continues from the topics discussed in &ldquo;Behavior Systems&rdquo; by exploring the world of pathfinding focusing primarily on the A* pathfinding algorithm. Pathfinding is the process of plotting out the shortest or most efficient path between two given points. A* (pronounced ay-star) is a particular pathfinding search algorithm used in many software applications for calculating this path. In determining the path, the A* algorithm takes a &ldquo;distance-to-goal + path-cost&rdquo; score into consideration.</p><ol><li>ai-programming-behavior-systems-part-01.zip</li><li>ai-programming-part-01.zip</li></ol><h3 id=app-development-with-aspnet-mvc>App Development with ASP.net MVC</h3><p>I’m thrilled to be able to announce that our new programming training series for our Member Sponsors, ‘Web Development with ASP.net,’ is now available for streaming here on 3D Buzz!

There are countless scenarios in computer graphics, and programming in general, where an equation might state a rule (or set of rules) that govern something that you&rsquo;re trying to work with. Therefore, the ability to work with and manipulate equations, using the algebraic topics covered in this volume, will be a huge boost to your skill set, whether a programmer or a technical artist.</p><ol><li>mathematics-algebra-part-01.zip</li></ol><h3 id=mathematics-volume-ii---trigonometry>Mathematics: Volume II - Trigonometry</h3><p>Volume II focuses on trigonometry, which is incredibly useful for solving problems relating to triangles.

We&rsquo;ll explore filters, layer styles, layer types, and more to maximize the heavy lifting Photoshop does for us when creating textures. By the end of the course, you&rsquo;ll have a strong start to a library of base textures you can use to create designs for games, web development, and more. You&rsquo;ll practice a little hand painting of textures, and complete 3 projects. Two 2D game pieces and a desktop background.</p><ol><li>photoshop-texture-libraries-part-01.zip</li><li>photoshop-texture-libraries-part-02.zip</li></ol><h3 id=practical-game-development-in-unity-4-level-1>Practical Game Development in Unity 4: Level 1</h3><p>This video series is all about the practical approach to using the tools made available to us in Unity 4 to create our very own video game!
