Asus Zenbook</h3><p>The ZenBook lineup has Asus’ flagship laptops and considering the hardware under its hood, the devices are surely one of the best in the market. Recently, Asus released the Zenbook Duo which has a unique form factor. It <strong>comes with a secondary display called ScreenPad Plus,</strong> similar to the touch bar on Macbooks, but consider it much larger in size and function. You can do a lot of multi-tasking in one tap and frankly I love it. As for the internals, it comes with the latest Intel Core i7 10th Gen processor which is great. Along with that, you also get <strong>1TB of SSD storage, 16GB of RAM</strong> and 2GB of NVIDIA GeForce MX250 graphics memory. Having said that, if you want a laptop with a simple form factor then go with the standard Zenbook 14. It’s equally good and comes with similar internals except for it packs the 8th gen i7 processor.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/13.-Asus-Zenbook.jpg loading=lazy alt="13.

Acer Nitro</h3><p>Acer has a stunning range of affordable gaming products which they popularly refer to Nitro series. The Acer Nitro series is simply the best when it comes to the internal hardware. For instance, you get a dedicated 4GB AMD Radeon RX 560X graphics card with the Ryzen 5 variant. And if you opt for the Intel Core i7 9th Gen variant, you <strong>get the powerful NVIDIA Geforce GTX 1650.</strong> It’s simply amazing that you can get a gaming laptop this powerful at this price. Other than that, both the laptops come with 8GB of RAM and a combination of 256GB of SSD and 1TB of HDD storage. All in all, if you are looking for the best SSD laptop for your gaming need, the Acer Nitro series offers you phenomenal value for the buck.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/14.-Acer-Nitro.jpg loading=lazy alt="14.

The MSI GL65 is one of the company’s top-of-the-line laptops, combining hardware in a beastly looking package. The gaming beast comes with the 9th-Gen Intel Core i7 processor coupled with 8GB of DDR4 RAM.

Asus ROG Strix G</h3><p>If pricing is not a bar for you, the Asus ROG Strix G Core i7 is a killer laptop for gaming. It’s packed with flagship hardware and you would be hard-pressed to find this kind of hardware in this price range. The Asus ROG Strix G <strong>comes with the latest Intel Core i7 9th-gen processor with 16GB of DDR4 RAM, 256GB SSD and 1TB HDD</strong>.

Not to mention, the laptop is equipped with an illuminated chiclet RGB keyboard. Considering all the points, I would say the Asus ROG Strix G is a powerful gaming laptop and you simply can’t go wrong with it. However, if you don’t have that budget then go for the affordable i5 variant. It comes with 8GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD storage, but the GTX 1650 remains even in the affordable one.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/17.-Asus-ROG-Strix-G-1.jpg loading=lazy alt=17.-Asus-ROG-Strix-G></p><h2 id=17-best-laptops-with-ssd-storage-you-can-buy>17 Best Laptops with SSD Storage You Can Buy</h2><p>So, that’s all from our side.
