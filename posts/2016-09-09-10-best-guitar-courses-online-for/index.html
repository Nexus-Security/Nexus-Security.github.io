The main reason behind them quitting guitar is that they are not following a structured class. Following unstructured guitar classes may lead to frustration when the student doesn’t see any tangible progress. That’s why taking a professional guitar course is always preferable to just winging it. But high prices and time commitment may discourage you from taking up a guitar class. That’s where online guitar courses can help you. Not only they are cheap but they also allow you flexibility. You can learn at your pace and see lectures when you have time. So whether you are thinking of taking guitar professionally or just as a creative hobby, these online guitar courses can help you learn your favorite musical instrument.</p><h2 id=best-online-guitar-courses-in-2019>Best Online Guitar Courses in 2019</h2><p>In this article, I have mentioned several types of guitar classes. Some take a very formal approach to guitar lessons while others are funky and filled with fun. Some are meant to take you towards a professional level while others are meant just for nurturing your passion and hobby for learning guitar. So, choose the course that meets your criteria. With that said, let’s get into our list, shall we?</p><h2 id=1-complete-guitar-system--beginner-to-advanced>1. Complete Guitar System – Beginner to Advanced</h2><p>If you have never touched a guitar before and want to start from scratch then this is the online guitar course for you. The course <strong>brings logical step-by-step methods to help you master guitar</strong> so you can not only play songs but also learn guitar theory. It is a vast course with 34.5 hours of video content and 158 downloadable resources. This guitar course will guide you throughout your learning journey. The course is taught by Erich Andreas who has been teaching people guitar professionally for the last 30 years. His YouTube videos have amassed more than 50 million views.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1-Best-Guitar-Courses-Online-on-Udemy.jpg loading=lazy alt="1 Best Guitar Courses Online on Udemy"></p><p>The course that we are featuring here has been <strong>taken by more than 100,000 students and has an overall rating of 4.5 stars</strong>. The best part about this course is that you don’t need any prior knowledge of guitar or music theory. The course starts at the first steps so its gold for beginners. Finally, since this course is on Udemy, you don’t have to subscribe to it. You just pay a onetime fee and have lifetime access to it. If you are a beginner and looking for a guitar course, do not miss out on this one.</p><p><em><strong>Course Rating:</strong> 4.5 (Rated by 16,636 students)</em></p><p><em><strong>Difficulty level:</strong> Beginner</em></p><p><em><strong>Buy Course on Udemy:</strong> <a class=link href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=vwtqSuskR*M&offerid=624447.11601&type=3&subid=0" target=_blank rel=noopener>Starting at $10.99</a></em></p><h2 id=2-the-professional-guitar-masterclass>2. The Professional Guitar Masterclass</h2><p>Another great guitar course online is the “The Professional Guitar Masterclass” on Udemy. While beginners can take this course, I think it’s best suited for guitar players who have a basic understating of the instrument. What I love about this course is that it aims to <strong>take students from imitation to creation</strong>. In any kind of art form, we first start by imitating our favorite creators and it takes time before we find our own voice. The aim of this course is to cut down that time and help you find your voice sooner. The course does that by teaching you to move away from memorizing chords and tunes and playing the guitar by understanding the underlying music theory.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2-Best-Guitar-Courses-Online-on-Udemy.jpg loading=lazy alt="2 Best Guitar Courses Online on Udemy"></p><p>As I mentioned before, this course is not for beginners. It’s for guitarists who feel that their improvement has plateaued. It’s for players who want to <strong>learn music theory, who want to plug the holes in their craft,</strong> who want to learn everything about the guitar’s neck, who want to be able to play any kind of song, and most importantly, it is for players who want to find their own voice. If that sounds like something you want, you should check it out right now.</p><p><em><strong>Course Rating:</strong> 4.4 (Rated by 4,172 students)</em></p><p><em><strong>Difficulty level:</strong> Intermediate</em></p><p><em><strong>Buy Course on Udemy:</strong> <a class=link href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=vwtqSuskR*M&offerid=624447.11602&type=3&subid=0" target=_blank rel=noopener>Starting at $10.99</a></em></p><h2 id=3-ultimate-beginner-guitar-masterclass-2019>3.

This is the perfect guitar course for hobbyist guitarists who just want to play their favorite songs for themselves and their friends and family.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/3-Best-Guitar-Courses-Online-on-Udemy.jpg loading=lazy alt="3 Best Guitar Courses Online on Udemy"></p><p>The course won’t take you through the hard theoretical stuff which usually turns casual players off. Instead, this is a <strong>crisp and small course which teaches you those important pieces of guitar techniques that provide the most improvements</strong>. The course is only 12 hours long so you don’t need to spend months finishing this one. Of course, if you want to become better you have to practice more, but you can get the basics down in no time. However, that also means that if you want to take the guitar professionally, you should keep clear of this course and focus on other courses mentioned on this list.</p><p><em><strong>Course Rating: 4.6</strong> (Rated by 2,329 students)</em></p><p><em><strong>Difficulty level:</strong> Beginner</em></p><p><em><strong>Buy Course on Udemy:</strong> <a class=link href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=vwtqSuskR*M&offerid=624447.11603&type=3&subid=0" target=_blank rel=noopener>Starting at $10.99</a></em></p><h2 id=4-fender-play>4. Fender Play</h2><p>Another great online guitar course for new guitar players is from Fender Play. Just like the course mentioned above, the Fender Play course focuses on helping you learn guitar using popular songs that you love. However, the course offers much more than the one mentioned above. The main difference here is that Fender Play also gives you access to advanced guitar training courses. The <strong>course is structured well and you have complete control over what you want to learn</strong>. Apart from teaching you electric and acoustic guitars, Fender Play also has classes for bass guitar and ukulele. So, the learning opportunity is much more diverse here. I also love the fact that there are multiple instructors making sure that you are always learning from the best.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/4.-Fender-Play.jpg loading=lazy alt="4. Fender Play"></p><p>There’s also <strong>a community of new guitar players just like you so you can always feel motivated</strong> and ask questions if you ever get confused. That being said, all these extra features come at a price. Fender Play is not cheap as it charges a subscription-based pricing system. The company charges $9.99/month or $89.99/year. They do offer discounts from time to time and have a generous trial period so you can check them out before buying the subscription. Fender Play is one of the best places to learn guitar online so you should check it out.</p><p><em><strong>Course Rating:</strong> NA</em></p><p><em><strong>Difficulty level:</strong> Beginner to Advanced</em></p><p><em><strong>Subscribe to Fender Play:</strong> <a class=link href=https://www.fender.com/play target=_blank rel=noopener>$9.99/month or $89.99/year</a></em></p><h2 id=5-guitar-tricks>5. Guitar Tricks</h2><p>Just like “Fender Play”, Guitar Tricks is a kind of an online academy for learning guitar. It is, by the way, one of the most popular guitar courses that you can find online. The company has been <strong>offering guitar lessons since 1998 and has to date taught 3 million people</strong> to play guitar. Guitar Tricks offers a very gentle climb in your guitar learning journey so you never feel frustrated. Its lessons are interconnected and organized to get slightly harder as you progress. So you end up mastering hard techniques overtime which you might have never believed you could. Just like Fender Play, you will also find multiple instructors here. They <strong>also provide one-on-one private lessons for people who need it</strong>.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/5.-Guitar-Tricks.jpg loading=lazy alt="5. Guitar Tricks"></p><p>But that will cost extra. That brings me to one of the biggest drawbacks of Guitar Tricks, which is its pricing. Not only the service charges a subscription pricing, but they also price it a bit high at $19.99/month. Do I think it’s worth it? Well, if you can afford to pay and are serious about your guitar, sure it is. However, for most people, the one-time buy courses are more than enough. And if you want extra Fender Play is still half as expensive as Guitar Tricks. You have a free trial, so you can check out the service before paying so there’s no harm in checking it out, is there?</p><p><em><strong>Course Rating:</strong> NA</em></p><p><em><strong>Difficulty level:</strong> Beginner to Advanced</em></p><p><em><strong>Subscribe to Guitar Tricks:</strong> <a class=link href=https://www.guitartricks.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>$19.95/month or $179.99/year</a></em></p><h2 id=6-jamplay>6. JamPlay</h2><p>Joining the roster of online guitar academy is “JamPlay” which is yet another good guitar lesson provider online. Just like Fender Play and Guitar Tricks, JamPlay is an online subscription service that gets you access to quality content taught by world-class guitar teachers and players. JamPlay offers new guitar players a structured path to start their guitar learning journey. Whether you have never held a guitar before or you are a good guitar player, JamPlay can improve your current guitar skills. There are more than 450 courses on JamPlay with 6500 lessons. <strong>They cover 128 different styles so you can learn country, metal, blues, or anything else that interests you</strong>. They keep updating their lessons with popular songs so you can not only find lessons on old classics but also new breakthrough titles. Like the above two, JamPlay offers a free trial so you should check it out before deciding on which service you want to subscribe to.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/6.-JamPlay.jpg loading=lazy alt="6.

ArtistWorks</h2><p>ArtistWorks is the one-stop solution for all your guitar learning needs. Whether you want to <strong>learn Rock Guitar, Bluegrass Guitar, Jazz Guitar, Classical Guitar</strong> or any other genre of guitar music, you can find exceptional classes on that here. Apart from acoustic and electric guitar, ArtistWorks also hosts courses on banjo, bass guitar, piano, ukulele, mandolin, violin, and a myriad of other instruments.

ArtistWorks"></p><p>As such, the <strong>courses are quite comprehensive and require a ton of effort from your part</strong>. Also, the service is quite costly as you get access to all the courses for a single subscription pricing. Most people won’t be able to justify that kind of money on guitar lessons. But if money is no concern for you and you want an in-depth technical knowledge of the instrument that you are learning, this is the place to be.</p><p><em><strong>Course Rating:</strong> NA</em></p><p><em><strong>Difficulty level:</strong> Beginner to Advanced</em></p><p><em><strong>Subscribe to ArtistWorks:</strong> <a class=link href=https://artistworks.com/plans-and-pricing target=_blank rel=noopener>$35.00/month (3 month plan) or $279/year</a></em></p><h2 id=8-ultimate-beginner-electric-guitar-masterclass-2019>8. Ultimate Beginner Electric Guitar Masterclass (2019)</h2><p>Another great online guitar course for beginners is the “Ultimate Beginner Electric Guitar Masterclass (2019)”. This course is <strong>meant for hobbyists and guitar enthusiasts who want to learn guitar for their pleasure</strong> and are not necessarily looking to make a professional career in the field. You will learn to play iconic and fun riffs and songs, understand the basics of music theory, read music tabs with ease, understand and implement <strong>new playing techniques, master the guitar fret-board and power chords,</strong> among other things.

Spice-Up Your Guitar Cover Songs: Develop Your Unique Style</h2><p>If subscription pricing is not your jam and you want a clean and simple course to help elevate your status from a boring to an interesting guitar player, then this is the course for you. Once you take this course, you will become a much more interesting guitar player. <strong>Songs that you’ve played before in a certain, plain way, will now open up to your many new creative choices</strong>.

Learn Guitar on YouTube</h2><p>If you cannot afford to pay anything and still want to take guitar lessons online, worry not, as there are <strong>several good YouTube channels that teach guitar for free.</strong> Of course, their lessons will not be as well structured and vigorous as the paid ones but it’s a great place to start if you don’t want to spend any money. If you are a hobbyist, there’s a high chance you won’t need any paid course and can learn guitar from watching lessons on YouTube itself. While searching for guitar lessons, keep in mind to keep away from channels that promise spectacular results in a week or month. Always stick to reliable resources and do a little bit of research before settling on a channel.
