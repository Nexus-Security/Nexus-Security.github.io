And rightly so, as it‚Äôs not only compatible but also more secure than other file formats. The one thing where PDF lacks is the ability to edit the document. That‚Äôs exactly what creates the need to have a PDF editing app to edit, annotate, or even convert other file types into PDFs. While the market is full of PDF editors, not all of them are secure and perform the assigned tasks with the desired efficiency. To help you track down the right contender for your professional or personal demand, we have lined up some of the best PDF editors that get the job done. So, let‚Äôs explore the roundup and pick out a complete PDF solution right now!</p><h2 id=top-10-pdf-editors-you-shouldnt-miss-out-in-2020>Top 10 PDF Editors You Shouldn‚Äôt Miss Out in 2020</h2><p>When it comes to choosing a PDF editor, you‚Äôve got to be very selective. Therefore, I think a little brainstorming up front is a must.</p><h3 id=what-pdf-editor-should-you-choose>What PDF Editor Should You Choose?</h3><p>Let‚Äôs get the big elephant out of the way first up! The choice of your PDF editor boils down to two pivotal aspects: Professional and Personal needs. Though other essential factors like proficiency, ease-of-use, and affordability also have major roles to play. If efficiency and top-of-the-line tools matter a lot and you are skilled enough to get the most out of advanced editing features, go for a full-fledged PDF editor. That‚Äôs as straightforward as it sounds.</p><p>But just in case you have to deal with PDFs only once in a blue moon, then opt for lightweight or online PDF editors that are available for free. Most of them come with all the basic tools to let you convert and annotate PDF files with ease. Keeping both the requirements in mind, we have selected both paid and free PDF editing apps/software. Now that the talk is over, it‚Äôs the right time to get started.</p><h2 id=1-foxit-phantompdf>1. Foxit PhantomPDF</h2><p>If versatility tops your priority list, Foxit PhantomPDF would be the right answer to your needs. Despite being a powerful PDF editor, PhantomPDF is pretty easy to maneuver, allowing you to <strong>create and edit docs at will</strong>. Plus, it also comes with several handy tools to let you keep all of your PDFs organized so that there is no clutter. Another notable feature is the PDF converter that lets you <strong>convert docs into PDFs</strong> without disturbing the layout, which is a big deal if you don‚Äôt want to compromise with quality.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Fox.jpg loading=lazy alt="Foxit PhantomPDF"></p><p>As someone who has to deal with PDFs more often than not especially in professional environments, I always look for a <strong>seamless collaboration feature</strong>. And from what I have experienced, PhantomPDF looks good enough to provide an intuitive collaboration so that the entire team can work together on a project. Moreover, it also allows easy sharing and <strong>integration with ECMs and cloud storage</strong> which can be quite helpful for businesses. Everything considered; PhantomPDF has got the goods to stake the claim of being one of the best PDF editors in the market.</p><p><em><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free, $79 for Standard version & $99 for Business</em></p><p>_<strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows and macOS¬†_</p><p><em><strong>Visit:</strong> <a class=link href=https://www.foxitsoftware.com/pdf-editor/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Website¬†</a></em></p><h2 id=2-nuance-power-pdf>2. Nuance Power PDF</h2><p>Nuance offering has long been one of the top PDF editors across the board. So, I don‚Äôt think many of you would be surprised to find this app ranking highly in this lineup. The highlight of this software has always been <strong>a range of powerful tools</strong> that offer better control over PDF editing. Whether it‚Äôs annotating PDF files, converting docs into PDF or transforming paper documents and images into editable PDFs, the app has covered all the essential aspects.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nuance-Power-PDF-.jpg loading=lazy alt="Nuance Power PDF"></p><p>Power PDF editor also works pretty well in merging and splitting PDFs. Times when you are creating a big project or an <a class=link href=https://beebom.com/best-online-presentation-tools/ target=_blank rel=noopener>impressive presentation</a>, the ability to combine multiple PDFs and other collection of docs like Word, Excel, PowerPoint into a single searchable PDF become very handy. The <a class=link href=https://beebom.com/best-grammarly-alternatives/ target=_blank rel=noopener><strong>integrated spell checker</strong></a> plays a vital role in making sure your document remains free from misspellings when you are filling out forms.</p><p>Not just that, the app also offers an efficient way to reduce the file size of PDFs so that you can upload them on the web or send them via email with ease. On top of all, you can encrypt your files using <strong>40-bit and 128-bit encryption</strong> to offer the required shield to your data and have the required control over¬†whether the document can be viewed, printed, edited, copied or annotated.</p><p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free trial, $129-$179</p><p><strong>Supported Platforms:</strong> Windows and macOS</p><p><em><strong>Visit:</strong> <a class=link href=https://www.nuancesoftwarestore.com/power-pdf-standard/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Website</a></em></p><h2 id=3-wondershare-pdfelement>3. Wondershare PDFelement</h2><p>If I were to pick an <strong>all-in-one PDF editor</strong> that can meet the demand of both pros and normal users, I would go for Wondershare PDFelement. What gives this software an edge over many other counterparts is the flexibility. For all being packed with high-end tools, it <strong>doesn‚Äôt require an extensive learning curve</strong>, unlike many other rivals. In terms of editing PDF files, the software keeps everything straightforward. Furthermore, it has got probably the most advanced OCR technology that easily turns scans into fully editable documents in more than 25 languages.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iSkySoft.jpg loading=lazy alt="Wondershare PDF editor "></p><p>Another feature that makes it a fine tool is the ability to <strong>convert PDFs</strong> into many other file types such as Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, HTML, image, and more. Aside from converting PDF files fast, it also ensures their layouts remain intact. Just in case you want to safeguard your files from prying eyes, you can choose to use the password-protection feature to <strong>encrypt your docs</strong> before sharing them.

Adobe Acrobat Reader DC</h2><p>In the seemingly crowded market of PDF editors, ‚ÄúAdobe Acrobat Reader‚Äù has always stood out for me. Granted, it‚Äôs way more expensive than many other premium offerings and also warrant a steep learning curve that can immediately put off normal users. However, if <strong>pro-level PDF editing</strong> is what you are after, overlooking Acrobat Reader isn‚Äôt the right way to go. The app is quite good at viewing, printing and commenting on PDF without compromising on quality.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Debe-.jpg loading=lazy alt="PDF Editor: Adobe Acrobat Reader DC"></p><p>In terms of versatility, Acrobat is ahead of the curve thanks to the support for a number of file formats.

While so many other PDF editors offer document signing features, I think it provides more flexibility in terms of customing signatures. Besides, the app has also looked proficient on the <strong>collaboration</strong> front which is very useful for teamwork. Not just that, it also provides a bit convenient way to review docs. Keeping in mind all these notable features, PDF Architect is a worthy choice for having a reliable PDF solution for professional and personal requirements.</p><p><em><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free, $49/year (standard) $69/year (professional) $89/year (Pro+OCR)</em></p><p>_<strong>Supported Platforms:</strong>¬†Windows¬†_</p><p><em><strong>Visit:</strong> <a class=link href=https://www.pdfforge.org/pdfarchitect target=_blank rel=noopener>Website¬†</a></em></p><h2 id=7-sejda>7.
