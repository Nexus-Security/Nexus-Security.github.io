are incredibly useful tools to have in your networking arsenal. They can keep your identity protected online, allow you to browse safely even on shady WiFi networks, help you circumvent a lot of regional restrictions on websites, access blocked content on the web, and do a lot more. So, if you’re looking to protect your privacy while browsing the internet on your iPhone, <em><strong>here are the best free VPN apps for iPhone that you can use:</strong></em></p><h2 id=1-tunnelbear>1. TunnelBear</h2><p>TunnelBear is a very well known VPN app. The TunnelBear app for iOS will allow you to connect to a VPN, and browse securely from a number of locations. You can choose to let the app decide on the best location to VPN from, or you can select the location that you want. In the free plan, TunnelBear offers <strong>500 MB of data per month</strong>, and you can get an additional 1 GB of data by tweeting at the TunnelBear handle. The app supports countries like <strong>US, Sweden, Switzerland</strong>, among many others.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/tunnelbear.jpeg loading=lazy alt=tunnelbear></p><p><em><a class=link href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tunnelbear-free-vpn-unlimited/id564842283?mt=8" target=_blank rel=noopener>Download</a> from the App Store (Free, with in-app purchases)</em></p><h2 id=2-vpn-by-surfeasy>2. VPN by SurfEasy</h2><p>One of the highest rated apps on the App Store – VPN by SurfEasy is definitely a good VPN app. By default, the app chooses the most optimum server location to route your traffic through, but if you want, you can change the location to a country that you prefer. SurfEasy offers a number of countries that you can choose to VPN from. The app caps the <strong>data limit to 250 MB</strong>, but you can get more data by completing the rewards available in the app. These rewards are things like: confirming email, rating the app, and more. None of the rewards require a lot of time to complete, so you can easily get some more data if you want. You can also <strong>upgrade your plan</strong> to the unlimited data plan at anytime, from the “Upgrades” tab in the app.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/surfeasy.jpeg loading=lazy alt=surfeasy></p><p><em><a class=link href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vpn-by-surfeasy-free-vpn-proxy/id633495655?mt=8" target=_blank rel=noopener>Download</a> from the App Store (Free, with in-app purchases)</em></p><h2 id=3-hotspot-shield>3. Hotspot Shield</h2><p>Hotspot Shield is another iOS VPN app that has received high ratings in the App Store. The app asks you to sign up (or sign in), when you first launch it. You can skip it, if you want to use it without creating an account. By default, the app <strong>connects you from a US location</strong>, and this can’t be changed in the free version of the app. If you want features like changing locations, or getting unlimited streaming data, you will have to subscribe to the Elite version of Hotspot Shield – a process you can complete with an in-app purchase. If you had already purchased Hotspot Shield Elite, the app even gives you an <strong>option to restore your purchase</strong>, so you can simply get started with your Hotspot Shield subscription.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/hotspot-shield.jpeg loading=lazy alt=hotspot-shield></p><p><em><a class=link href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hotspot-shield-free-privacy/id443369807?mt=8" target=_blank rel=noopener>Download</a> from the App Store (Free, with in-app purchases)</em></p><h2 id=4-betternet>4. Betternet</h2><p>Betternet is a very minimally designed, and easy to use VPN app, with highly positive ratings on the App Store. You can use the app for free, but in the <strong>free version you can only choose from 8 cities in the US</strong>. If you want to access the other countries supported by the app, you will have to become a premium user. You can do this with an in-app purchase. Premium membership will also give you additional features, such as a <strong>faster connection</strong>, along with high quality support for any problem that you might face. Betternet is, as far as VPN apps go, the easiest to use VPN app that you can get on the App Store.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/betternet.jpeg loading=lazy alt=betternet></p><p><em><a class=link href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/free-vpn-proxy-betternet-unlimited/id946659216?mt=8" target=_blank rel=noopener>Download</a> from the App Store (Free, with in-app purchases)</em></p><h2 id=5-vpn-in-touch>5. VPN in Touch</h2><p>Another VPN app for the iPhone that you can try, is called VPN in Touch. The first thing to know about this app, is that you <strong>can’t use it without registering</strong>. However, registering on the app is easy, and once you’ve done that, you’re taken to main interface of the app. Here, you can choose from a number of locations, enable data savings and more. The app starts you off with a <strong>free subscription to the Premium plan for 6 days</strong>, after which you will have to extend your subscription. The app works well, and is definitely worth a try.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/vpn-in-touch.jpeg loading=lazy alt=vpn-in-touch></p><p><em><a class=link href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vpn-in-touch-free-vpn-proxy/id464241430?mt=8" target=_blank rel=noopener>Download</a> from the App Store (Free, with in-app purchases)</em></p><h2 id=6-vpn-proxy-by-seed4me>6. VPN Proxy by Seed4.Me</h2><p>VPN Proxy is another free VPN app for iOS that you can use to protect your privacy online, and to circumvent geo-restricted websites, and content. The app has a <strong>straight to the point interface</strong>, starting off by letting you select the location you want to VPN from. Once you have done that, you will be asked to install a VPN profile, to enable VPN access from the app. The app works fine, and can surely be used in case you don’t want to use the other apps on this list for some reason. Installation of the VPN profile is done through a website that you’ll have to open in Safari, and agree to the terms and conditions for. Once you have done all that, you will be able to freely browse the internet, without worrying about your privacy online.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/seed4me.jpeg loading=lazy alt=seed4me></p><p><em><a class=link href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vpn-proxy-by-seed4.me-free/id860180339?mt=8" target=_blank rel=noopener>Download</a> from the App Store (Free, with in-app purchases)</em></p><h2 id=7-vpn-master-free>7. VPN Master Free</h2><p>You can also check out VPN Master Free, for browsing through a VPN network on your iPhone. The app has a <strong>very nice interface, and works quite fast</strong>. By default, the app connects you through whatever location it deems best for higher speeds, and stability. However, you can choose from a <strong>number of other locations</strong> that are available in the app. There are only <strong>seven locations available in the free version</strong> of the app, and you can unlock VIP to get access to a lot of other locations, as well. The VIP service in the app can be subscribed to at $2.99 per month.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/vpn-master.jpeg loading=lazy alt=vpn-master></p><p><em><a class=link href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vpn-master-free-vpn-proxy/id1025707485?mt=8" target=_blank rel=noopener>Download</a> from the App Store (Free, with in-app purchases)</em></p><h2 id=8-opera-vpn>8. Opera VPN</h2><p>Opera, the well known browser, also has a free VPN service for iOS. The Opera VPN app is <strong>completely free to use</strong>, although it doesn’t have a lot of different locations that you can connect through. Once you have installed the app, and the VPN profile, you can start browsing the web safely. By default, the app is set to connect to the closest region, for optimal speed, and stable connection; however, you can choose to connect through any one of the <strong>5 available countries</strong>. Opera VPN features two tabs: Stats, and Settings. In the Settings tab, you can enable or disable the VPN itself, and <strong>block trackers</strong>, etc from the websites you visit.

While this isn’t exactly a VPN app, the 1.1.1.1 DNS app (iOS/Android) uses a VPN to route your search traffic to Cloudflare’s free 1.1.1.1 DNS. Cloudflare promises that it will never store your personal information on its servers, and that it won’t sell your data to third parties. Plus, there’s no registration required on Cloudflare to use their free DNS, and unlike most VPN services that have monthly usage limits, Cloudflare’s service is completely free for unlimited usage. You can check out our article on <a class=link href=https://beebom.com/use-cloudflare-dns-visit-blocked-websites/ target=_blank rel=noopener>how to set up Cloudflare’s 1.1.1.1 DNS</a> in case you don’t want to use the app.</p><p><strong>SEE ALSO: <a class=link href=https://beebom.com/how-block-unknown-callers-iphone-natively/ target=_blank rel=noopener>How to Block Unknown Callers in iPhone Natively</a></strong></p><h2 id=use-these-iphone-vpn-apps-to-secure-your-online-privacy>Use These iPhone VPN Apps to Secure Your Online Privacy</h2><p>While using VPN apps usually slows down the speed with which you can access the web, it’s still advisable to use VPN services (the good ones), especially when you’re browsing on a Public network. VPNs can also let you access geo-locked content, that you would otherwise not be able to access. There are a lot of advantages of using a VPN server to browse the internet. So, if you’re even remotely conscious about your privacy online, you should definitely consider using a VPN app for your iPhone.
