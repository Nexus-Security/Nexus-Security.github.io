What does that mean? Narrowly, it means something about the force of the man‚Äôs personality and its effects on those who worked for him at Apple. More broadly, it has something to do with his gradual emergence as a cultural icon over the past decade. The wave of emotion that washed across the Internet following the news of his death is evidence of how important he was to many people. Business leaders don‚Äôt often come to have that sort of cultural resonance. Apple‚Äôs storefronts became impromptu shrines and memorials, something we can safely say will not happen at gas stations or supermarkets when the CEOs of Exxon Mobil or Nestl√© pass on.</p><p><a class=link href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/zokuga/6228737557/ title="Steve Jobs memorial, Apple Store Upper West Side by Dan Nguyen @ New York City, on Flickr" target=_blank rel=noopener><img src=http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6060/6228737557_5db9213fdc_b.jpg loading=lazy alt="Steve Jobs memorial, Apple Store Upper West Side"></a></p><p>There has been a smaller but still noticeable backlash from those who found the scale and content of these initial reactions bizarre or repellent. They argued, variously, that personal expressions of grief by ordinary people for the billionaire CEO of a giant company are simply irrational; that those who insisted on giving Jobs full credit for Apple‚Äôs visionary products nevertheless happily absolved him of any responsibility for the conditions endured by workers in the factories where those products are made; or simply that Jobs was a personally unpleasant character unworthy of the love heaped upon him.</p><p>Whichever way you see it, there is clearly more at work here than measured assessments of someone who excelled in maximizing shareholder value. Jobs‚Äô charisma is at the heart of it.</p><h2 id=charismatic-authority>Charismatic Authority</h2><p>Writing in the early part of the twentieth century, <a class=link href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Weber target=_blank rel=noopener>Max Weber</a> wondered why people followed the wishes and demands of others in the absence of direct coercion. He thought there were three sources of legitimate authority: <em>charismatic</em>, <em>traditional</em>, and <em>legal-rational</em>. The first rests on loyalty to a specific person. You follow a person because of who they are. The second rests on loyalty to tradition. You follow a person because they are in an age-old role, such as Father, or Coach, or Priest. And the third rests on loyalty to a set of codified rules that are accepted on principle: you follow a person because of your assent to the legally-established office they occupy, such as Judge, or Supervisor, or President.</p><p>In practice, Weber thought, these forms would be mixed-up or layered one on the other or nested together. But he held to the idea that the different principles mattered. Weber argued that legal-rational authority was on the rise historically, and that it predominated in the modern world. The organizational manifestation of this form of authority is the bureaucracy, most obviously in the form of the State. It is also, though, closely related to the calculative rationality of capitalist markets and the institution of the modern corporation.</p><p><img src=https://kieranhealy.org/files/misc/charismatic.jpg loading=lazy></p><p>Despite the rise of the rationalized bureaucracy, Weber thought charisma remained an important and indeed ineradicable force in society. Charisma is a quality attributed to individuals, but it is more than <em>personality</em> or <em>charm</em> or <em>celebrity</em> or <em>glamour</em>. Although it is associated with religious leadership (the root of the word means ‚Äúthe gift of divine grace‚Äù), Weber didn‚Äôt care if the claims of charismatic leaders are ultimately provably correct or incorrect, true or false. Calling someone charismatic is a description, not an endorsement. For Weber, charisma is</p><blockquote><p>a certain quality of an individual personality whereby [someone] is set apart from ordinary men and treated as endowed with supernatural, super-human, or at least specifically exceptional powers or qualities. These are regarded as not accessible to the ordinary person ‚Ä¶ and on the basis of them the individual concerned is treated as a leader.</p></blockquote><p>The idea that Jobs created a <a class=link href="http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&story=Reality_Distortion_Field.txt&topic=Reality%20Distortion&sortOrder=Sort%20by%20Date&detail=medium" target=_blank rel=noopener>reality distortion field</a> around himself was half-jokingly coined by <a class=link href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bud_Tribble target=_blank rel=noopener>Bud Tribble</a>, who worked on the Macintosh project. But charismatic leadership is not just a cheap Jedi mind trick. Charisma is partly a personal quality, but also a social relation. Because it is a basis for legitimate authority, it‚Äôs something people must <em>recognize</em> and in some way <em>assent to</em> in order for it to be effective. Charismatic leaders are internally driven, but they also need to be externally recognized as exceptional and, crucially, they must succeed to some degree in order to find the followers they seek:</p><blockquote><p>Charisma knows only inner determination and inner restraint ‚Ä¶ and [the leader] demands obedience and a following by virtue of his mission. His success determines whether he finds them. His charismatic claim breaks down if his mission is not recognized by those to whom he feels he has been sent. If they recognize him, he is their master‚Äîso long as he knows how to maintain recognition through proving himself.</p></blockquote><p>Or to put it another way, <a class=link href="http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Real_Artists_Ship.txt" target=_blank rel=noopener>real artists ship</a>. The leader must deliver, at least to the satisfaction of his team or band of followers. Once he does, though, Weber argues that ‚Äúit is the duty of those to whom he addresses his mission to recognize him as their charismatically qualified leader‚Äù.</p><p>Charismatic leaders, by the way, do not have to be kind, ethical, or pleasant people:</p><blockquote><p>How the quality in question would be ultimately judged from any ethical, aesthetic, or other such point of view is ‚Ä¶ indifferent for purposes of definition. What is important is how the individual is actually regarded by ‚Ä¶ his ‚Äúfollowers‚Äù or ‚Äúdisciples‚Äù.</p></blockquote><h2 id=charisma-and-internal-organization>Charisma and Internal Organization</h2><p>Charismatic leadership is personal in nature and, to begin with, organizationally flat.</p><blockquote><p>The administrative staff of a charismatic leader does not consist of ‚Äúofficials‚Äù ‚Ä¶ It is not chosen on the basis of social privilege ‚Ä¶ There is no hierarchy: the leader merely intervenes in general or in individual cases when he considers the members of his staff inadequate to a task with which they have been entrusted.</p></blockquote><p><img src=https://kieranhealy.org/files/misc/pirate_flag.jpg loading=lazy></p><p>As John Lilly <a class=link href=http://lilly.tumblr.com/post/11230723028/steve-jobs# target=_blank rel=noopener>remarks</a>, ‚ÄúThe stories of how brutal he could be on the people around him ‚Äî employees, competitors, and everyone else ‚Äî are legion, and they‚Äôre not apocryphal. He could be deeply dehumanizing and belittling to the people around him ‚Ä¶ As a leader of people, you have to respect how much he (and more importantly, his teams) accomplished. But I struggle with some of the ways that he led, and how they affected good people.‚Äù The combination of inner vision, contempt for rules, and the ability to moblize others results in a leadership style that is at once rebellious and autocratic. <a class=link href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2968750" target=_blank rel=noopener>It‚Äôs better to be a pirate than join the navy</a>, but the <a class=link href="http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&story=Pirate_Flag.txt&topic=Retreats&sortOrder=Sort%20by%20Date" target=_blank rel=noopener>Pirate Captain</a> is in charge. He can interfere anywhere and his authority is absolute: <a class=link href="http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&story=Sound_By_Monday.txt&topic=Management&sortOrder=Sort%20by%20Date&detail=medium" target=_blank rel=noopener>‚ÄúIf I don‚Äôt hear great sound coming out of that prototype by Monday morning, we‚Äôre going to remove the amplifier‚Äù</a> ‚ÄúI think he‚Äôs bluffing‚Äù, Andy Hertzfeld told Burrell Smith after this demand. ‚ÄúBut what if he‚Äôs not?‚Äù</p><p>Charismatic leaders create new things, and new standards, deliberately setting themselves against the received wisdom‚Äîespecially written rules:</p><blockquote><p>From a substantive point of view, every charismatic authority would have to subscribe to the proposition, ‚ÄúIt is written that ‚Ä¶ but <em>I</em> say ‚Ä¶‚Äù The genuine prophet ‚Ä¶ preaches, creates, or demands <em>new</em> obligations. ‚Ä¶ When such an authority comes into conflict with the competing authority of another ‚Ä¶ the only recourse is to some kind of a contest ‚Ä¶ In principle only one side can be in the right ‚Ä¶</p></blockquote><p>Weber has some more to say about the attitude of the charismatic leader to the world of rational economic planning and bureaucratic administration:</p><blockquote><p>‚Ä¶ Charisma lives in, though not off, this world. Whenever it appears, it consitutes a ‚Äúcalling‚Äù in the most emphatic sense of the word, a ‚Äúmission‚Äù or a ‚Äúduty‚Äù ‚Ä¶ It is not that charisma always means the renunciation of property or even of acquisition ‚Ä¶ What is despised is traditional or rational everyday economizing ‚Ä¶ It repudiates any sort of involvement in the everyday, routine world.</p></blockquote><p><img src=https://kieranhealy.org/files/misc/jobs-home.jpg loading=lazy></p><p>In terms of personal style, this can be seen in the well-known photograph of Jobs sitting on the floor in his unfurnished house, or in his preference for particular kinds of eyeglasses or shoes or wristwatches. It is not so much a renunciation of material possessions as a disregard for the usual reasons for owning them, and a rejection of the parts of the world that don‚Äôt measure up. The photograph is meant to evoke a sort of monastic asceticism, certainly, but on closer inspection you notice the room is illuminated by what looks like a Tiffany lamp. Jobs admired <a class=link href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Lewis_Tiffany target=_blank rel=noopener>Charles Lewis Tiffany</a> for his ability to mass-produce beautiful things. As Larry Ellison remarked <a class=link href=http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2009/technology/0911/gallery.steve_jobs_testimonials.fortune/3.html target=_blank rel=noopener>‚ÄúThe difference between me and Steve is that I‚Äôm willing to live with the best the world can provide.</a> With Steve that‚Äôs not always good enough.‚Äù In much the same way, when it came to managing his organization the charismatic emphasis on a vocation or calling coupled with a contempt for ordinary measures of success resulted in questions like <a class=link href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sculley#1983.E2.80.9393_:_Apple target=_blank rel=noopener>‚ÄúDo you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life</a> or come with me and change the world?‚Äù This moment with John Sculley, by the way, is the <a class=link href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%201:16-17&version=NKJV" target=_blank rel=noopener>Mark 1:16-17</a> of the Apple mythos.</p><p>Weber describes charismatic authority in a partly idealized form. He notes that it‚Äôs only at the very beginning of a charismatic leader‚Äôs career that such a flat organization can be maintained, or the nuts and bolts of planning and specialization be blithely ignored. For one thing, the leader has to deliver on his promises in a way that satisfies those who are following him. For another, he needs help to get anything done.</p><h2 id=the-routinization-of-charisma>The Routinization of Charisma</h2><p>Any successful organization‚Äîcharismatic or not‚Äîfaces the problem of maintaining itself as a coherent entity as it gets bigger. How do you keep things working smoothly and effectively as the structure expands and differentiates? Simply getting bigger makes the organization harder to coordinate. More layers are necessary, there‚Äôs a greater distance between the center and the periphery, communication between units requires more time and overhead, there are more people to manage and more opportunities for politics. Positions and offices within the organization become turf to occupy and defend for their own sake. And so on.</p><p>Charismatic organizations, however, face an additional problem. A paradox of charismatic authority is that the leader changes the world‚Äîat least, the followers‚Äô world‚Äîbut once the leader dies, or moves on, those left behind must face the problem of how to preserve the new world the leader made. Charismatic leadership is transformative. Its mode of action is intense, personal, and often turbulent. But in its aftermath, those left behind may see themselves as having a legacy to preserve, a flame to keep alive, a vision to enact. There is a shift from transformation to preservation. With it comes the danger of calcification and stagnation.</p><p>This does not mean that the life of the group becomes static right away. To the contrary, many charismatic movements are also expansionary organizations, often especially in the aftermath of their founder‚Äôs passing. They want to convert others. That means energetic efforts to spread the word by conversion, co-optation, or coercion. But whatever about its edges, the <em>core</em> members of the organization quickly face the problem of how to codify and institutionalize the personal vision of the original leader. This is the problem of the routinization of charisma.</p><p><img src=https://kieranhealy.org/files/misc/whatnow.jpg loading=lazy></p><p>It is very hard to preserve the legacy of a charismatic founder within the structure of an organization. Most obviously, the perennial question of what the leader would do <em>now</em> must be settled by those left behind. Even if everyone is honestly committed in principle to preserving the founder‚Äôs legacy, as opposed to imposing their own plans, and even if everyone agrees in general outline about what the founder‚Äôs vision <em>was</em>, different people still will give different answers to the question, ‚ÄúWhat would the leader have done in this situation?‚Äù</p><p>It would be easy to see Steve Jobs as just the sort of egomanical leader who would sooner sink his ship than see someone else at the helm. But this is not what happened. Jobs faced and solved the short-run leadership problem by the standard method of choosing a successor. What‚Äôs more striking is that he also saw and attacked the longer-term institutional problem. In addition to picking a new leader and cultivating an echelon of executives that in his view were up to the job, he hired the sociologist Joel Podolny to run ‚ÄúApple University‚Äù. (Podolny is now in charge of the company‚Äôs entire HR division). Initially, no-one outside the firm knew what Apple University was going to be. Many thought it was going to be some sort of extension of the educational offerings on iTunes. But it turned out to be much more ambitious and inwardly directed than that: Podolny was charged with anatomizing how Apple worked internally and turning that knowledge into something formally transmissable to new staff. At the time of his hire, <a class=link href=http://www.kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2008/10/23/apple-hires-joel-podolny/ target=_blank rel=noopener>I noted</a> that Podolny‚Äôs research in <a class=link href=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8034.html target=_blank rel=noopener><em>Status Signals</em></a> meant that he was much better-positioned than many bog-standard analysts to understand how Apple works. Whether that strategy will be successful of course remains to be seen. Charismatic leaders are notorious for being unable to envision their creation surviving without them and so avoid planning for that inevitability. In the wake of the founder‚Äôs death many charismatic organizations rapidly collapse, succumb to schisms and infighting, or drift aimlessly toward the rocks like rudderless galleons. Jobs and the rest of Apple clearly worked hard to avoid that fate.</p><h2 id=charisma-craft-and-the-division-of-labor>Charisma, Craft, and the Division of Labor</h2><p>So far I have been talking about Jobs internal relationship to the organization he founded. What about the broader community of people who used Apple‚Äôs products? Most of the public emotion came from them. To some outside this group, the strength of their response seemed preposterous‚Äîa grotesque effulgence of maudlin sentiment confirming every cultish, fanboy stererotype; and all for the love of a billionaire businessman who ran a company that made computers and phones. What to make of this side of things?</p><p>The double-edged logic of charisma is once again useful here. Charismatic authority is fundamentally destructive of the past, but the feelings of loyalty or commitment it generates can become the raw material for nostalgia. This seems especially true when those feelings are detached from any first-hand experience of the person they are directed towards. People inside Apple worked with the possiblity of having to face a living, breathing, perhaps very annoyed Steve Jobs. Their commitment to the organization‚Äîand their feelings for its leader‚Äîhad some depth as a consequence. For people who just use Apple products, though, there is no such connection. This means ‚ÄúSteve Jobs‚Äù could become a wish-fulfillment figure on whom to project one‚Äôs own feelings‚Äîa kind of celebrity, in other words, rather than an organizational leader. The connection <em>feels</em> strong because of one‚Äôs own life-course and the role of some piece of computer hardware or software in it: the first Mac you owned and what you did with it, the code you write now and the standards you set for it. Their legendary social awkwardness notwithstanding, nerd culture has a thick streak of sentimentality in it, often tied to the cultural objects of pre-adolescence. (If you don‚Äôt believe me, browse around <a class=link href=http://www.reddit.com target=_blank rel=noopener>Reddit</a> and wait for some posts titled ‚ÄúDoes anyone else remember this guy/game/TV show ‚Ä¶?‚Äú) It‚Äôs the positive end of an emotional dipole that has at its negative end the sterile, teenaged rage of anonymous online comment threads. From there, it can be just a short hop to an extravagant emotionality that quickly becomes kitsch: the nerd equivalent of a <a class=link href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=princess+diana+porcelain+bride+doll" target=_blank rel=noopener>Princess Diana Doll</a>, a <a class=link href=http://rsa.cwrl.utexas.edu/node/2418 target=_blank rel=noopener>Commemorative 9‚ÅÑ11 Musical Lighter</a>, or a <a class=link href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=velvet+elvis" target=_blank rel=noopener>Velvet Elvis</a>.</p><p>No-one had less time for that sort of treacle than Jobs himself. When he returned to Apple in 1997, he cleared out a large quantity of memorabilia from the company and <a class=link href=http://news.stanford.edu/pr/97/971119apple.html target=_blank rel=noopener>gave it away to Stanford</a>. Similarly, those swept up in the emotion of it all should probably remember that, as <a class=link href=http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/37-a-story-of-triumph target=_blank rel=noopener>John Siracusa remarked last week</a>, Steve Jobs was not your friend.</p><p>There‚Äôs more to it than kitsch, though. Jobs <em>was</em> indirectly responsible for many people‚Äôs careers‚Äîat least, that‚Äôs what many working in and around the world of software development and web design felt as they looked back. There‚Äôs little reason to doubt them. For a whole swathe of developers, programmers, designers, and writers, Apple‚Äôs products catalyzed their own interest in technology while confirming their belief in the value of good design. <a class=link href=http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/10/on-the-life-legacy-and-media-r.html#comment-9461040 target=_blank rel=noopener>Kathy Sierra</a> provides a good example:</p><blockquote><p>We do not mourn Steve because of our feelings for Steve, but because of our feelings about ourselves. ‚Ä¶ Personally, I believe that much of our feelings for Steve Jobs are not because of our ‚Äúworship‚Äù of his ‚Äúgenius‚Äù, but because his work has helped us discover our own.</p></blockquote><p>Or, in a slightly different way, <a class=link href=http://5by5.tv/specials/2 target=_blank rel=noopener>Merlin Mann:</a></p><blockquote><p>You gotta be kidding me, you want me to use a Mac? Those things are toys, right? ‚Ä¶ I eventually bought my own toy. I wrote my thesis on a toy. I learned desktop publishing on a toy. And after I graduated, every job I‚Äôve had since then has involved one of those toys. And it‚Äôs true to this day. I take photos of my daughter on a toy. My kid and I make music together on a toy. ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm really glad Steve Jobs made the toy, I‚Äôm really glad he kept making it better and better, and I‚Äôm really grateful to live in a time when you can have such wonderful toys right in your pocket.</p></blockquote><p><img src=https://kieranhealy.org/files/misc/ipadchild.jpg loading=lazy></p><p>This personal connection people feel with Apple‚Äôs products, together with Jobs‚Äô own standards of excellence in design and manufacturing, opens up a potentially uncomfortable channel. Apple used to be a niche company, serving a very small portion of the consumer electronics market. Its products were much more expensive than those of its competitors. That‚Äôs all changed now. (‚ÄúStill angry how in 2001 Apple used their illegal monopoly of 3% of the market to force us into this hellish nightmare of devices that work‚Äù, <a class=link href=https://twitter.com/#!/wilshipley/status/123202323941040128 target=_blank rel=noopener>Wil Shipley drily noted</a>.)</p><p>During Jobs‚Äô second tenure as CEO, Apple found a way to to institutionalize its ability to reliably innovate new products and bring them to huge new markets. They have coped far, far better than average with many of the problems that come with rapid growth. This has been accomplished partly though the company‚Äôs ability to decouple from its supply and manufacturing chain while still controlling it through logistical expertise and, more recently, sheer market power. This has allowed Apple to remain sharply focused on hardware and software design, and sales. In an earlier era, the result of such rapid growth would have been a far larger, vertically integrated company with many more factories and workers to directly manage. Instead, Apple has been able to protect its product-centered core‚Äîthe part of the company made in the image of Steve Jobs‚Äîand still take full advantage of a globalized, disaggregated production regime, without being weighed down by it. This was Tim Cook‚Äôs main achievement as COO. To echo <a class=link href=http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/37-a-story-of-triumph target=_blank rel=noopener>John Siracusa again</a> (you really should be listening to his podcast), the result is a company that continues to act like a startup even though it‚Äôs huge. <a class=link href=http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2007/01/we_make_the_who/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Apple makes the whole widget</a>‚Äîdesign, software, hardware, service‚Äîbut without owning the factories where the widgets are actually assembled.</p><p><img src=https://kieranhealy.org/files/misc/foxconn.jpg loading=lazy></p><p>This organizational success created the conditions for some of the backlash we saw last week. It is very unusual to see a company with such a large market have so much sentiment associated with it. At present, three aspects of the company now sit together in an awkward way. The first is the quite personal nature of Apple‚Äôs products‚Äîat your desk, in your hand, in your pocket‚Äîtogether with the fact that many people use them for creative or otherwise personally meaningful work. The second is the public success of Jobs‚Äô relentless focus on excellent, elegant, beautiful design: <a class=link href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/30/magazine/the-guts-of-a-new-machine.html?pagewanted=2&src=pm" target=_blank rel=noopener>‚ÄúDesign is how it works.</a>‚Äú The whole thing, not just the packaging. And the third is that, because it‚Äôs a huge company selling in a mass market, Apple‚Äôs products are assembled in factories in China by low-paid workers working in grim, relentless, dangerous conditions.</p><p>This is a well-recognized problem with technological utopias: goods that are simple and elegant to <em>use</em> are often difficult and dangerous to <em>make</em>. A wide gap may open between the consumers and the producers of beautiful pieces of personal technology: it‚Äôs an elegant, creative, meaningful future for me, but a lifetime toiling on a Foxconn production line for thee. This gulf is worse for a company like Apple precisely because there‚Äôs so much emphasis placed on the intimate quality of the object, and such close attention paid to its design. Jobs <em>wanted</em> people to love his products, take care to notice their craftsmanship, and be creative with them. They were supposed to help you make and do awesome things. But this love and attention to creativity is severed from the manufacturing process.</p><p>Too bad, you might say. Such are the hard exigencies of business life. Many a CEO would agree. But Jobs‚Äô outlook makes that sort of cold, rationalized calculation difficult to sustain in a way that‚Äôs consistent with the company‚Äôs vision of itself. Charisma rejects this sort of thinking. <a class=link href="http://www.folklore.org/ProjectView.py?project=Macintosh&characters=Steve%20Jobs&detail=medium" target=_blank rel=noopener>‚ÄúI want it to be as beautiful as possible,</a> ‚Äú Jobs insisted of a prototype Macintosh circuit board, ‚Äúeven if it‚Äôs inside the box. A great carpenter isn‚Äôt going to use lousy wood for the back of a cabinet, even though nobody‚Äôs going to see it.‚Äù For a long time, though, Jobs was happy to use lousy labor and bad tools behind the cabinet. Eventually, people took a look around the back. The result was a sort of cognitive dissonance.</p><p>The tension doesn‚Äôt arise just because the products are mass-produced rather than true craft items. After all, in a modern economy <a class=link href=http://www.kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2007/10/03/invisible-hands/ target=_blank rel=noopener>there‚Äôs no escape from the division of labor</a>. Every good and service you encounter from your first cup of coffee in the morning to the paste on your toothbrush at night is implicated in a huge, interdependent, intensely specialized network of exchange. You can‚Äôt get away from it. Even the most intense survivalists dangle at the end of a supply chain of gear, goods, and cultural know-how. As a consumer, the question is which parts of this web you feel you ought to care about. Should your paper be recycled? Should your coffee be fair-trade? Should you stay away from tropical hardwoods, seek out local foods? Now, what about those consumer electronics you love so much?</p><p>The factories that make iPads and MacBooks also make components for other firms, but no-one paid much attention to the labor or environmental records of Samsung or Dell. People don‚Äôt care about those products enough. Because Apple was relatively small for so long, its customers did not feel much pressure to care much in that direction, either. There weren‚Äôt enough of them, anyway. But during its remarkable expansion in the 2000s, environmental and labor activists realized that the effort Apple had invested in its product design and marketing, together with the personal connection many people felt to their Macs, iPads, and iPhones, meant the company was a clear target for social movement activism and consumer pressure. Like the Nike boycotts of the 1990s, the emotional ties people had to the brand‚Äîwhich the company had spent so much time building and profiting from‚Äîwere there to be appealed to and mobilized for other purposes. It worked, too. Nike pioneered the idea of a corporation that made tangible products while not owning any production facilities, but this decoupled structure wasn‚Äôt enough to save them from criticism. In Apple‚Äôs case, it became harder and harder for the charismatic leader to wash his hands of this aspect of his creation.</p><h2 id=the-half-life-of-charisma>The Half-Life of Charisma</h2><p><img src=https://kieranhealy.org/files/misc/mac-signatures.jpg loading=lazy></p><p>One last story from Andy Hertzfeld about the development of the Macintosh:</p><blockquote><p><a class=link href="http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Signing_Party.txt" target=_blank rel=noopener>Since the Macintosh team were artists</a>, it was only appropriate that we sign our work. Steve came up with the awesome idea of having each team member‚Äôs signature engraved on the hard tool that molded the plastic case, so our signatures would appear inside the case of every Mac that rolled off the production line. Most customers would never see them, since you needed a special tool to look inside, but we would take pride in knowing that our names were in there, even if no one else knew.</p></blockquote><p>How will Jobs‚Äô charisma persist at Apple? I wonder most whether his death will make it easier or harder for those who want to monitor and improve Apple‚Äôs labor and environmental practices. On the one hand, for much of his career Jobs showed absolutely no interest in these or related issues‚Äîhis strictly personal liberal values notwithstanding. On the other hand, once Apple moved from its niche position into a mass market, the way his charismatic vision was built into the organization made it increasingly difficult for both Apple and Jobs to dissociate themselves from the conditions under which their products were made. There was too much of him in the iPhone and iPad, and he had successfully convinced many of his customers to see themselves and their creative lives in those products, too. Jobs was at times visibly irritated by the pressure from environmental activists. But the company responded to it, nevertheless.</p><p>The signatures hidden inside the original Macintosh model suggest how Jobs‚Äô vision might have been extended to the production side of things. Though latent or ignored for a long time, with Apple‚Äôs transformation it might have reasserted itself‚Äîshoved along by outside pressure‚Äîin a way that made concerns with manufacturing conditions consistent with Apple‚Äôs overall view of itself. Like bad wiring and bad taste, bad production would ritually pollute the founders vision of things, and the users‚Äô experience of them, in a way that demanded some kind of systematic response.</p><p>Apple has shown <a class=link href=http://www.apple.com/environment/reports/ target=_blank rel=noopener>some movement</a> in <a class=link href=http://www.apple.com/supplierresponsibility/ target=_blank rel=noopener>this direction</a>, though there is room for plenty more. Now that Cook‚Äîthe logistics guy‚Äîis in charge, a significant shift seems likely only if it is impelled from the outside. The natural constituency to give the needed push is that same group of people who found themselves unexpectedly affected by Jobs‚Äô death. They face their own small crisis of charismatic routinization. They can choose to remember Jobs in a way that emphasizes only his personal character, which risks going down the Velvet Elvis route and instituting a sterile cult of personality that Jobs would have himself despised. Or they might press Apple to be more thoroughgoing and expansive in its commitment to the general principles Jobs cared about, and built into the core part of the company he made‚Äîpride in craft, devotion to excellence, a determination to use technology to enable creativity as widely as possible. <a class=link href=http://www.npr.org/2011/10/06/141115121/steve-jobs-computer-science-is-a-liberal-art target=_blank rel=noopener>The intersection of technology and the liberal arts.</a> Of course, he might have rejected that interpretation. I don‚Äôt know. Steve Jobs was not my friend. But it will be interesting to see whether the new Apple will feel any pressure to exemplify his principles in this sphere‚Äîand whether enough of the company‚Äôs many fans will feel Jobs‚Äô memory deserves no less.</p><p><a class=link href=https://kieranhealy.org/categories/ target=_blank rel=noopener>All Categories</a></p><p>from Hacker News <a class=link href=https://ift.tt/2he3r3K target=_blank rel=noopener>https://ift.tt/2he3r3K</a></p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-copyright><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="icon icon-tabler icon-tabler-copyright" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="2" stroke="currentcolor" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path stroke="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="9"/><path d="M14.5 9a3.5 4 0 100 6"/></svg><span>Licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</span></section></footer></article><footer class=site-footer><section class=copyright>&copy;
