Besides being my personal favourite court (and that is no secret), over the past few years the CJEU has become a cornerstone of EU copyright harmonization, and has defined such things as the scope of economic rights, exceptions and limitations, the residual freedom of Member States in areas harmonized at the EU level <strong>[see <a class=link href="https://academic.oup.com/jiplp/article/9/7/585/2910877?searchresult=1" target=_blank rel=noopener>here</a> for an article written a few years ago regarding Member States’ own freedom in the field of copyright]</strong>. </p><p>Recently, the CJEU has been asked by a few national courts questions that are even more basic and – because of this – probably more crucial than the above. They can be summed up as follows: what is needed for copyright protection to arise in the first place?</p><p>Whilst a question like this is one that is posed in the first class of any copyright course, answering it has not proved straightforward at all (take note, students!).</p><p>Ten years ago, the CJEU issued its seminal decision in <em>Infopaq</em> <strong>[Kat-anniversary post <a class=link href=http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/07/todays-10-year-anniversary-of-cjeu.html target=_blank rel=noopener>here</a>]</strong>, in which it de fact harmonized the standard of originality beyond what EU legislature had done in relation to software, databases and photographs. </p><p>Since then, the Court has further refined the concept of originality and provided hints that, indeed, the implications of this string of cases would go beyond the key concept of what is ‘original’ <strong>[see <a class=link href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2468104" target=_blank rel=noopener>here</a> for an article that I wrote a few years ago regarding the implications of CJEU case law for subject matter harmonization]</strong>. Recently, that this was indeed the case became apparent in <em>Levola Hengelo</em> <strong>[Katposts <a class=link href="http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/search/max-results=7?q=levola+hengelo" target=_blank rel=noopener>here</a>]</strong>, in which the CJEU defined the concept of ‘work’. </p><p>This year, the overall process which began with <em>Infopaq</em> has culminated in the judgment in <em>Cofemel</em> <strong>[Katpost <a class=link href=http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/09/the-cofemel-decision-well-beyond-simple.html target=_blank rel=noopener>here</a>]</strong>. The CJEU clarified that, indeed, for copyright protection to arise what is only required is (1) a work which (2) is sufficiently original. The judgment, which is not surprising, has immediate implications for copyright protection of designs, but goes well beyond that. </p><p>It is the IPKat copyright decision of the year because, indeed, it makes it apparent once and - hopefully - for all how profound the harmonization carried by the CJEU has been.</p><p><strong>Most important piece of legislation</strong></p><p><a class=link href=https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EZ1FxNTFjzE/XgsOpLQYXeI/AAAAAAAANHM/mx-H-VUAxNAkQhxA7ZEBRL4vTP2E_t9pgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screenshot%2B2019-12-31%2Bat%2B10.02.17.png target=_blank rel=noopener><img src=https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EZ1FxNTFjzE/XgsOpLQYXeI/AAAAAAAANHM/mx-H-VUAxNAkQhxA7ZEBRL4vTP2E_t9pgCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/Screenshot%2B2019-12-31%2Bat%2B10.02.17.png loading=lazy></a></p><p>There is no doubt here: it is the <strong><a class=link href=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2019/790/oj target=_blank rel=noopener>Directive 2017/790 on copyright in the Digital Single Market</a></strong> (DSM Directive) <strong>[Katposts <a class=link href="http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/search/max-results=7?q=dsm+directive+series" target=_blank rel=noopener>here</a>]</strong>, which became law in mid-2019. Now, EU Member States have time until June 2021 to transpose it into their own legal systems. </p><p>As far as the UK is concerned, the big question mark is not whether this soon to be former EU Member State will have to transpose it (under the current Brexit timeframe, it appears that such obligation will not exist), but whether it would wish to do so or, in any case, adopt domestic legislation that mirrors the content of the EU directive.</p><p>The Directive is important in that it shows: first, how controversial copyright policy- and law-making can be; second, how difficult it is to reconcile conflicting interests (including, of course business interests); and, finally, how copyright legislation can have an impact on very different fields and sectors.</p><p>The text of the directive is <em>not always</em> crystal-clear and this means that the story around it is far from over. It seems unavoidable that uncertainties will arise, in the first place, at the national transposition level (some EU Member States have already begun this process) and then at the application phase. Courts, including the CJEU, will likely be busy for years to come. </p><p><strong>Copyright person of the year</strong></p><p><a class=link href=https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5SJ0Mckf2jU/XgsO0FNkhjI/AAAAAAAANHQ/TuGMM_J1ADEWvM7lBD0AHYGkcB7Xiz87ACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/DSC_0002-300x199.jpg target=_blank rel=noopener><img src=https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5SJ0Mckf2jU/XgsO0FNkhjI/AAAAAAAANHQ/TuGMM_J1ADEWvM7lBD0AHYGkcB7Xiz87ACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/DSC_0002-300x199.jpg loading=lazy></a></p><p><em>Lord Justice Arnold</em></p><p>This year’s copyright person is someone who: (1) has been pivotal to shaping – inter alia - domestic copyright law; (2) has had a profound and fruitful dialogue with the CJEU on a range of different IP issues over the years; and (3) has influenced other countries’ courts and approaches, particularly with regard to online enforcement.</p><p>It is Sir Richard Arnold, who – this year – has been elevated from the High Court to the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, thus becoming Lord Justice Arnold <strong>[Katpost <a class=link href=http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/07/mr-justice-arnold-to-become-lord.html target=_blank rel=noopener>here</a>]</strong>.</p><p>Since <em>Newzbin 2</em> <strong>[the first copyright blocking injunction in the UK: Katpost <a class=link href=http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2011/07/son-of-newzbin-another-victory-for-film.html target=_blank rel=noopener>here</a>]</strong> in 2011, Lord Justice Arnold has shaped the UK IP enforcement landscape. He probably holds the personal record as the individual judge who has referred the highest number of cases to the CJEU (not just in the field of copyright), and his decisions have been studied and have had a profound impact in other jurisdictions, both EU and non-EU ones.</p><p>The IPKat wishes to celebrate his much-deserved elevation and looks forward to reading and commenting on future judgments. </p><p><strong>Most important unresolved issue</strong></p><p><a class=link href=https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jIxVv8so28k/XgsPD20A4JI/AAAAAAAANHc/NtsNabv-s08CrUBU5vxlgJKXd-qI1ns4ACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/the-letter-b-the-alphabet-22186966-500-500.jpg target=_blank rel=noopener><img src=https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jIxVv8so28k/XgsPD20A4JI/AAAAAAAANHc/NtsNabv-s08CrUBU5vxlgJKXd-qI1ns4ACLcBGAsYHQ/s200/the-letter-b-the-alphabet-22186966-500-500.jpg loading=lazy></a></p><p>The B-word is of course something that will continue shaping the IP debate in 2020. Whilst copyright is likely to be less affected - at least immediately - than registered rights, the departure of the UK from the EU and the future relationship between them will have fundamental implications also for this IP right.</p><p>Seen from an EU IP perspective, one of the biggest and yet least discussed issues will be the fact that UK courts will likely lose their power to refer cases to the CJEU (see currently <a class=link href=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/16/section/6/enacted target=_blank rel=noopener><strong>s6 of the Withdrawal Act 2018</strong></a>).
