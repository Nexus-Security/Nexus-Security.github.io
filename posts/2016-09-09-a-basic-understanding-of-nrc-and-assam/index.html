Today&rsquo;s article is on the NRC and the Assam Accord</p><p><strong>What is the National Register of Citizens (NRC)</strong></p><p><strong>T</strong>he<br>National Register of Citizens (NRC) has become another political football. The<br>BJP‚Äôs decades-old stand on the NRC has remained the same. From the party‚Äôs<br>manifesto in the 1996 general election to the 2019 general election, the BJP<br>has remained firm on completing an NRC to curb illegal migration into India,<br>especially in the north-eastern states from Bangladesh.</p><p>In the 1996 manifesto, the party articulated <strong>three<br>Ds: detection, deletion, and deportation</strong> ‚Äì detection of illegal immigrants,<br>deletion of their names from the electoral rolls, and deportation to the<br>country of their origin.</p><p>In the 2019 manifesto, the party declared that: _‚ÄúThere has been a huge change in the cultural and linguistic identity<br>of some areas due to illegal immigration, resulting in an adverse impact on<br>local people‚Äôs livelihood and employment. We will complete the National<br>Register of Citizens process in these areas on priority. In future we will<br>implement the NRC in a phased manner in other parts of the country. We will<br>continue to undertake effective steps to prevent illegal immigration in the<br>north-eastern states. For this we will further strengthen our border security.‚Äù</p><p>_</p><p><strong>What is the Assam Accord?</strong></p><p><strong>T</strong>he reader must note that the NRC idea is not the<br>BJP‚Äôs baby. The NRC idea, first proposed in 1951, took root in the 1970s when<br>the All Assam Students Union (AASU) launched a mass movement after its scrutiny<br>of the local electoral rolls revealed names of a large number of illegal<br>Bangladeshis. The AASU protested vehemently with its ‚ÄòDs‚Äô demand: detection,<br>deletion, and deportation ‚Äì detection of illegal immigrants, deletion of their<br>names from the electoral rolls, and deportation to Bangladesh. The protest<br>gained popular traction as it touched a raw nerve of the locals: they had been impacted<br>adversely, especially demographically and economically, by the presence of illegal<br>Bangladeshis.</p><p>However, it was only in August 1985 when the Rajiv Gandhi-led Congress<br>Government and the AASU signed the Assam Accord. The central feature of the<br>Assam Accord were the 3 Ds: detection, deletion, and deportation ‚Äì detection of<br>illegal immigrants, deletion of their names from the electoral rolls, and<br>deportation to Bangladesh.</p><p>Under the Assam Accord, the Citizenship Act was<br>amended to include clause 6A that provided for the classification of immigrants<br>in Assam:¬†</p><ul><li><p>those who came before 1966 (including Hindu refugees who fled East<br>Pakistan during the 1965 war);¬†</p></li><li><p>those who came between 1966 and 24 March 1971 (when war with Pakistan<br>officially commenced); and¬†</p></li><li><p>those who came after 25 March 1971 (war refugees and later illegal<br>immigrants).¬†</p></li></ul><p>Citizenship was to be given to all those who migrated before 1966 from<br>east Bengal and east Pakistan. Those who came between 1966 and 1971 were to be<br>disenfranchised and granted citizenship after due process. Those who came after<br>24 March 1971 were to be detected and deported.</p><p>Subsequent governments at both the Centre and in<br>Assam failed to complete the NRC. Fed up with the indifferent attitude of the<br>state government, the AASU knocked on the doors of the Supreme Court, which ruled<br>that the NRC, promised under the Assam Accord, must be completed under its<br>supervision.</p><p>Now, it is clear that the NRC in Assam was (i) a<br>provision of the Assam Accord, to which the Congress was a party; (ii) held in<br>the state after the Supreme Court of India called for its implementation and<br>(iii) the central government has had no role in its completion.</p><p>The draft NRC in Assam registered 2,89,83,677 out of the<br>state‚Äôs 3.3 crore population (census-based). The rest were left out; in other<br>words, they could be classified as ‚Äòillegal immigrants‚Äô. It is here that the<br>Bangladesh Government comes in; in case, Bangladesh refuses to acknowledge these<br>four million as its own citizens, they run the risk of being labelled ‚Äòstateless‚Äô.</p><p>For now, t<a class=link href=https://www.blogger.com/null target=_blank rel=noopener></a>he BJP‚Äôs flip-flop has<br>only muddled the NRC debate. Things get murky when the ruling party does not lend<br>clarity on its current stance, especially considering the several misgivings<br>about documentation and proof of citizenship.</p><p>**Identifying illegal foreigners ‚Äì whose job is it?</p><p>****T**he<br>Central Government is vested with powers to deport a foreign national under<br>section 3(2)(c) of the Foreigners Act, 1946. These powers to identify and<br>deport¬†illegally staying¬†foreign nationals¬†have also been<br>delegated to the State Governments/ Union Territory Administrations and the<br>Bureau of Immigration under the Foreigners Act, 1946. Detection and<br>deportation of such illegal immigrants is a continuous process. Statistical data of cases regarding illegal immigrants is not centrally<br>maintained.</p><p>I think the BJP should run a better PR machine with focus on three central aspects of the CAA:¬†(a) that the CAA is an amendment to the existing Citizenship Act, 1955,<br>(b) that it only speeds up the process of granting citizenship to members of<br>certain communities, and (c) that it does not relate to the citizens of India.</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-copyright><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="icon icon-tabler icon-tabler-copyright" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="2" stroke="currentcolor" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path stroke="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="9"/><path d="M14.5 9a3.5 4 0 100 6"/></svg><span>Licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</span></section></footer></article><footer class=site-footer><section class=copyright>&copy;
