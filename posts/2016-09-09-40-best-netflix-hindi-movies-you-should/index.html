rel=noopener>feature international movies</a> and <a class=link href=https://beebom.com/best-tv-series-on-netflix/ target=_blank rel=noopener>shows</a> but also offers a great selection of Indian movies. The catalog of Indian movies on Netflix is second to none, with the service offering some of the best movies that Bollywood has ever produced. So, if you are a Bollywood movie aficionado or want to play a movie for your family, you will find some really good options on Netflix. So, if you are looking to indulge yourself with some good Netflix Hindi movies, here are the 40 best Bollywood movies on Netflix you can watch in 2020.</p><h2 id=best-netflix-hindi-movies-in-2020>Best Netflix Hindi Movies in 2020</h2><h2 id=1-the-lunchbox-2013>1. The Lunchbox (2013)</h2><p>Let’s start our article with one of the most under-rated and a gem of a movie produced by Bollywood which is The Lunchbox. The story of Lunchbox revolves around an Indian housewife and an older man. The movie starts with a simple premise. <strong>What if the critically acclaimed Mumbai Dabbawala misplaced a lunchbox?</strong> With this simple hook, we are led into a story which is full of love, family, and emotions and takes you on a journey that you will never be able to forget. What happens you ask? Well, you will have to watch the movie to find out, won’t you? The Lunchbox is one of the best Netflix hindi movies to watch.</p><p><a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/title/70278932 target=_blank rel=noopener>Check out</a> The Lunchbox on Netflix</p><h2 id=2-queen-2014>2. Queen (2014)</h2><p>One of my favorite Hindi movies of all time is Queen. The story revolves around a traditional family girl who has never set her foot out of her comfort zone and now decided to tour Europe on her own. What forces her to take this step and what happens afterward is the whole story of the movie. The <a class=link href=https://beebom.com/best-comedy-movies-on-netflix/ target=_blank rel=noopener>movie is hilarious</a> and sad at the same time. <strong>Kangana Ranawat who plays the lead character Rani has killed with her performance in this movie</strong>. This is one Netflix Hindi movie that you won’t regret watching.</p><p><a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/title/80032081 target=_blank rel=noopener>Check out</a> Queen on Netflix</p><h2 id=3-manto-2018>3. Manto (2018)</h2><p>Manto is the <strong>life story of controversial and troubled Indo-Pakistani writer Sadat Hussain Manto</strong>. The story focuses on the artistic and censorship challenges faced by the writers while he was creating his work. The main character Manto is being played by ever awesome Nawazuddin Siddiqui and might I say it is his one of the best performances yet. The plot is gripping and will hold you till the last minute. I enjoyed watching this movie a lot and highly recommend to all Netflix viewers.</p><p><a class=link href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81039383?so=su" target=_blank rel=noopener>Check Out</a> Manto on Netflix</p><h2 id=4-special-26-2013>4. Special 26 (2013)</h2><p>While Hollywood is full of great con movies, it’s something that Bollywood has never been able to get right, that is until Special 26 hit the theaters. Starring Akshay Kumar, t<strong>he movie revolves around a con man and his team who pose as CBI and Income Tax officers</strong> to rob prominent rich businessmen and politicians who are evading tax. If you love con movies and are looking for good Netflix Hindi movies, you are going to love this one.</p><p><a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/title/70273637 target=_blank rel=noopener>Check Out</a> Special 26 on Netflix</p><h2 id=5-no-one-killed-jessica-2011>5. No One Killed Jessica (2011)</h2><p>Released in 2011, No One Killed Jessica might be quite old but the storyline still holds true. The story revolves around a girl who is trying to get justice for the murder of her younger sister. <strong>You will see betrayal, corruption, and everything else that we have come to expect from India’s criminal justice system</strong>. This is a must watch who likes a good thriller movie.</p><p><a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/title/70139076 target=_blank rel=noopener>Check out</a> No One Killed Jessica on Netflix</p><h2 id=6-brahman-naman-2018>6. Brahman Naman (2018)</h2><p>If you love raunchy comedy movies, then this one is just for you. The movie doesn’t boast of any A-list actors or directors but what it does pack is <strong>a tight and gripping storyline which will leave you in tears with laughter.</strong> The story revolves around a group of young men who are a part of a quiz team and are looking to lose their virginity. While this move is not for everyone, if you love raunchy comedies, you should definitely see it once.</p><p><a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/title/80097355 target=_blank rel=noopener>Check out</a> Brahman on Netflix</p><h2 id=7-bareilly-ki-barfi-2017>7. Bareilly ki Barfi (2017)</h2><p>Released in 2017, Bareilly ki Barfi is a movie which will tickle your funny bones in all the right places. Boasting of a talented star cast including Ayushmann Khurrana, Kriti Sanon, Rajkummar Rao, and my favorite Pankaj Tripathi, <strong>the story revolves around Bitti who is a free-spirited small-town girl who lives her life on her own terms</strong>. What happens to her when she meets Chirag Dubey (Ayushman) and Pritam Vidrohi (Rajkumar Rao) is the whole movie. This one is an entertainment bomb.</p><p><a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/title/81016193 target=_blank rel=noopener>Check out</a> Bareilly ki Barfi</p><h2 id=8-pad-man-2018>8. Pad Man (2018)</h2><p>Pad Man is the real-life story of Arunachalam Muruganantham who created a cheap solution for sanitary pads aiming to help millions of women in India. The main character is played by Akshay Kumar who is excellent on screen and <strong>exceptionally displays the trials and tribulations that Muruganantham had to face in real life</strong>. Of course, there’s also trademark Akshay Kumar humor to make you laugh. This is a very good movie to watch.</p><p><a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/title/81016191 target=_blank rel=noopener>Check out</a> Pad Man on Netflix</p><h2 id=9-mom-2017>9. Mom (2017)</h2><p>Mom is the last work of Bollywood superstar Sridevi who sadly passed away this year. The story revolves around a mother (played by Sridevi) who is exacting revenge on a group of boys who attacked her daughter and escape justice. <strong>While the movie follows a by the number revenge plot, the exceptional and heart-wrenching performance of Sridevi makes it worth watching</strong>. If you are a fan of her, you should definitely keep this Netflix Hindi movie in your watchlist.</p><p><a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/title/80201175 target=_blank rel=noopener>Check out</a> Mom on Netflix</p><h2 id=10-udta-punjab-2016>10. Udta Punjab (2016)</h2><p>Udta Punjab is a collection of stories which focuses on drug abuse in the affluent north Indian State of Punjab and how the youth there have been corrupted by this addiction. <strong>Not only does the movie push a social agenda but it is also accompanied by jaw-dropping performances from the likes of Shahid Kapoo</strong>r, Alia Bhatt and more. This movie is not for the faint of heart so make sure you know what you are getting into before you start streaming this one.</p><p><a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/title/80118002 target=_blank rel=noopener>Check out</a> Udta Punjab on Netflix</p><h2 id=11-drishyam-2015>11. Drishyam (2015)</h2><p>Based on the Malyalam super hit movie of the same name, <strong>Drishyam is a story about  a man who will do anything to save his family.</strong> Ajay Devan plays the lead character and he has killed with his performance in this role. To talk more about this movie will mean that I will have to give key plot points away and I don’t want to do that. Just know that this is one of the best thriller movies Bollywood has ever produced.</p><p><a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/title/80068117 target=_blank rel=noopener>Check out</a> Drishyam on on Netflix</p><h2 id=12-pink-2016>12. Pink (2016)</h2><p>Pink (2016) is a great Hindi movie on Netflix which hits on the patriarchal nature of Indian society which is ready to blame girls on each and every turn. <strong>The movie is made great by the exceptional performance of Amitabh Bachchan who plays the role of a retired lawyer</strong> who picks up practicing again to save three young women who are implicated in a crime. If you love a good crime drama, you are going to enjoy this one.</p><p><a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/title/80144448 target=_blank rel=noopener>Check out</a> Pink on Netflix</p><h2 id=13-a-wednesday-2008>13. A Wednesday (2008)</h2><p>This is one of my all-time favorite movies of Bollywood. The movie marks a height in Indian cinema which is rarely achieved. The story is about a common man who is fed up with terrorist attacks and decides to do something himself. <strong>It features two of the biggest actors of Indian cinema; Naseeruddin Shah and Anupam Kher and puts them against each other</strong>. The resulting dialogue and conversation are just jaw-dropping. A real gem of Hindi movies, A Wednesday is a must watch.</p><p><a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/title/70107499 target=_blank rel=noopener>Check out</a> A Wednesday on Netflix</p><h2 id=14-bahubali-2015-and-bahubali-2-2017>14. Bahubali (2015) and Bahubali 2 (2017)</h2><p>Bahubali and its sequel Bahubali 2 are probably the most hyped movies of India and deservedly so. No movie has ended on such a cliffhanger as Bahubali. <strong>The period drama featuring Prabhas has been directed by the critically acclaimed, S.S. Rajamouli</strong>. While this is not technically a Bollywood movie, it was made in collaboration with Dharma Production, and I had to include it on this list.</p><p>Check Out (<a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/title/80204117 target=_blank rel=noopener>1</a> / <a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/title/80203996 target=_blank rel=noopener>2</a>) Bahubali on Netflix</p><h2 id=15-dear-zindagi-2016>15. Dear Zindagi (2016)</h2><p>I had stopped expecting good movies from Shahrukh Khan after Chennai express and I was mostly right. However, the release of Dear Zindagi changed all that. <strong>Seeing Shahrukh in a story driven plot is something of an anomaly these days and hence Dear Zindagi is a must watch</strong>. Propelled by a gripping storyline and great performances from Alia Bhatt and Shahrukh Khan, this is a movie that you don’t want to miss.</p><p><a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/title/80158042 target=_blank rel=noopener>Check out</a> Dear Zindagi on Netflix</p><h2 id=16-pk>16. PK</h2><p>PK is a story filled with humor and warmth. The story revolves around an alien who has come to earth but has lost his clothes along with the only device he can use to communicate with his spaceship. See Amir Khan playing this alien who is having a hard time adjusting on earth. <strong>The movie touches on various social customs and religious superstitions.</strong> This is a great Hindi movie and should be on your Netflix watch list.</p><p><a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/title/70303496 target=_blank rel=noopener>Check out</a> Pk on Netflix</p><h2 id=17-masaan-2015>17. Masaan (2015)</h2><p>Masaan is yet another small budget Hindi movie which will make you believe in the power of free Hindi cinema. <strong>The movie focuses on two different stories portraying loss and how people deal with it.</strong> The story deals with complex topics of the social fabric of India and delivers a good watch along with a strong social message.</p><p><a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/title/80059331 target=_blank rel=noopener>Check out</a> Masaan on Netflix</p><h2 id=18-sanju-2018>18. Sanju (2018)</h2><p>Whether you believe in the story of Sanjay Dutt portrayed in this movie or not, no one can deny that it’s a great watch. Ranbir Kapoor plays as Sanjay Dutt and he is excellent. <strong>From Sanjay Dutt’s voice to his body language, Ranbir has nailed everything To-a-T in this performance</strong>. The movie is also quite entertaining. If you admire great individual performance, this is a good Hindi movie to watch and it’s available on Netflix so get watching now.</p><p><a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/title/81020508 target=_blank rel=noopener>Check out</a> Sanju on Netflix</p><h2 id=19-madras-cafe-2013>19. Madras Cafe (2013)</h2><p>Another great Netflix Hindi movie, Madras Cafe is an action thriller movie which showcases the journey of an Indian intelligence agent to a war-torn coastal island to break a resolute rebel group and meet a passionate journalist. <strong>The movie stars John Abraham and it is probably his best performance in any movie.</strong> He is not just a pile of muscle and shows that if given good a script, he can act too. Do check this movie out.</p><p><a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/title/70293703 target=_blank rel=noopener>Check out</a> Madras Cafe on Netflix</p><h2 id=20-margarita-with-a-straw-2014>20. Margarita With A Straw (2014)</h2><p>Another movie which showcases a great individual performance is Margarita With A Straw. The movie revolves around a young woman with cerebral palsy (played by enigmatic Kalki Koechlin) who moves to New York to study. <strong>The movie is about love and self-discovery</strong> and you are going to enjoy watching it on a weekend.</p><p><a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/title/80018695 target=_blank rel=noopener>Check out</a> Margarita With A Straw on Netflix</p><h2 id=21-gurgaon-2017>21. Gurgaon (2017)</h2><p>A Netflix original Hindi movie, Gurgaon features an awesome acting performance from its star cast. Pankaj Tripathi is especially great in this movie. <strong>The plot of the movie revolves around kidnapping and is as gripping as a crime thriller can be</strong>. The movie focuses on human character and how mean and dark we humans can get. Oh yes, just when you start thinking it’s a movie, remember that it’s loosely based on a true story.</p><p><a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/title/80990815 target=_blank rel=noopener>Check out</a> Gurgaon on Netflix</p><h2 id=22-ugly-2013>22. Ugly (2013)</h2><p>If Gurgaon didn’t succeed in dwindling your faith in humanity, Anurag Kashayp’s 2013 thriller Ugly will. You will learn how low humans can get to achieve what they want in their lives. <strong>A story of human deception, ego, and jealousy will leave your faith shattered, especially with its last scene</strong>. Be sure that you are ready for this movie as it’s not for light-hearted viewers. It’s available on Netflix and is a great Hindi movie to watch.</p><p><a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/title/70285730 target=_blank rel=noopener>Check out</a> Ugly on Netflix</p><h2 id=23-taare-zameen-par-2007>23. Taare Zameen Par (2007)</h2><p>Taare Zameen Par deals with the topic of dyslexia and how parents who don’t understand their children can unknowingly ruin their lives. <strong>It also showcases the importance of a good teacher in your life.</strong> The movie is very emotional and you might drop a tear or two.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/taare-zameen-par-image.jpg loading=lazy></p><p><a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/title/70087087 target=_blank rel=noopener>Check out</a> Taare Zameen Par on Netflix</p><h2 id=24-barfi-2012>24. Barfi (2012)</h2><p>Barfi is a story about three people who fall in love and how their life changes with each decision they make. The lead character is Burfi, played by extremely talented Ranbir Kapoor who has given one of the best performance of his career in this movie. <strong>This movie will make you reconsider society’s definition of abnormal and normal</strong>.

Swades (2004)</h2><p>Swades is one of the best movies of Shahrukh Khan. While the movie bombed on box office, it has attained a cult status among its fans since then. <strong>The movie is a simple story about an NRI who returns to India to take her nanny to America</strong>. In doing so, he rediscovers his roots and understands why it’s important to stay in his own country and work for its advancement.</p><p><a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/title/70019491 target=_blank rel=noopener>Check out</a> Swades on Netflix</p><h2 id=26-stree-2018>26. Stree (2018)</h2><p>Directed by Amar Kaushik, Stree is <strong>a great mix of comedy and horror</strong>. The movie is based on the Bangalore urban legend called Nala Ba (come tomorrow) and revolves around a spirit that knocks on people’s doors at night. Starring the <strong>national award winner Rajkumar Rao and Shraddha Kapoor</strong>, it has a gripping story. Plus, the likes of Pankaj Tripathi, Aparshakti Khurana, and Abhishek Banerjee have done quite well in the supporting roles. As for the box-office success, the movie was able to mint ₹280.76 crores against the budget of just ₹25 crores.</p><p><a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/in/title/81113921 target=_blank rel=noopener>Check out</a> Stree on Netflix</p><h2 id=27-kabir-singh-2019>27. Kabir Singh (2019)</h2><p>This one is primed for Shahid Kapoor fans! Directed by Sandeep Vanga, the movie is a <strong>remake of Telugu film called “Arjun Reddy”</strong> (2017, also made by Sandeep). The story revolves around a surgeon called Kabir Singh (Shahid Kapoor) who becomes self-destructive after his girlfriend Preeti (Kiara Advani) leaves him. Thanks largely to the commendable acting of Shahid, the film scores big numbers on the box-office, <strong>amassing over ₹379 crores</strong> to be the second highest-grossing film of 2019.</p><p><a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/in/title/81107545 target=_blank rel=noopener>Check out</a> Kabir Singh  on Netflix</p><h2 id=28-andhadhun-2018>28. Andhadhun (2018)</h2><p>If you have a liking for a <strong>black comedy crime thriller film</strong>, chances are Andhadhun will win you over. The film is about a piano player Akash (Ayushmann Khurrana) pretending to be visually-impaired. His life gets embroiled into too many problems when he witnesses the murder of a former film actor. Aside from Ayushmann, <strong>Tabu and Radhika Apte have played pivotal roles</strong> in the movie. The intriguing plot coupled with the loving songs composed by Amit Trivedi makes it a must-watch for the folks who are fond of black comedy.</p><p><a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/in/title/81039381 target=_blank rel=noopener>Check out</a> Andhadhun on Netflix</p><h2 id=29-kahaani-2012>29. Kahaani (2012)</h2><p>If a <strong>killer mystery thriller</strong> is what you are after, give serious consideration to Kahaani. Co-written, produced, and directed by Sujoy Ghosh, the movie <strong>follows the life of a pregnant woman</strong> (Vidya Bagchi) showcasing her endless struggle to find her missing husband. Aside from Vidya Balan, Nawazuddin Siddiqui has also played a significant role in the movie. It won critical acclaim for exploring themes of feminism and motherhood in a society largely dominated by males. Moreover, the screenplay and cinematography also received high praise for being classy.</p><p><a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/in/title/70236020 target=_blank rel=noopener>Check out</a> Kahaani on Netflix</p><h2 id=30-the-sky-is-pink-2019>30. The Sky Is Pink (2019)</h2><p>Should you wish to go for a <strong>heart-touching biographical movie</strong>, “The Sky Is Pink” could be worth checking out. The film is about the family of Aisha Chaudhary, a <strong>14-year old motivational speaker</strong> who died due to pulmonary fibrosis. Priyanka Chopra has donned the role of Aisha’s (Zaira Wasim), while Farhan Akhtar has played the role of her father. Apart from showing the difficult times that the family goes through, the movie also displays an emotional love-story between PC and Akhtar.</p><p><a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/in/title/81037373 target=_blank rel=noopener>Check out</a> The Sky Is Pink on Netflix</p><h2 id=31-dangal-2016>31. Dangal (2016)</h2><p>I don’t think there are too many Bollywood sports films that are as memorable as Dangal. Mr. perfectionist “Aamir Khan” has excelled in his role as a <strong>former wrestler (Mahavir Singh)</strong> who pursues the gold medal he never won by training his two strong-willed daughters named Geeta Phogat and Babita Kumari. Set in the Indian state of Haryana, the film is loosely <strong>based on the Phogat family</strong> and its tryst with the coveted medals at the Commonwealth Games. Beyond the story, Pritam’s music and Amitabh Bhattacharya’s lyrics are also worthy of praise.</p><p><a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/in/title/80166185 target=_blank rel=noopener>Check out</a> Dangal on Netflix</p><h2 id=32-motichoor-chaknachoor-2019>32. Motichoor Chaknachoor (2019)</h2><p>Though Motichoor Chaknachoor couldn’t rock the box-office, it has got all sorts of ingredients to be a notable pick. The movie is <strong>about a 36-year-old man “Pushpinder Tyagi”</strong> (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) who is working in Dubai. Tyagi is desperately trying to find a girl to marry back home in Bhopal. During the hunt of a suitable wife, he meets a much younger neighbor Anita (Athiya Shetty) who is willing to <strong>marry someone settled abroad</strong>. Though Nawazuddin has performed his role quite well, it’s Athiya who is kind of stolen the show.</p><p><a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/in/title/81116576 target=_blank rel=noopener>Check out</a> Motichoor Chaknachoor on Netflix</p><h2 id=33-force-2-2016>33. Force 2 (2016)</h2><p>For filling your showtime with plenty of hardcore action, you can’t go wrong with Force 2. It’s the <strong>sequel to the 2011 Force film</strong> that had done exceedingly well on the silver screen. Starring John Abraham as ACP Yashwardhan, this action thriller is about <strong>a brave police offers who teams up with a RAW agent</strong> to expose an inside informer who leaks sensitive information to a foreign agency. Apart from raw action scenes, the movie also shows nice chemistry between John and Sonakshi Sinha, the leading lady of the movie.</p><p><a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/in/title/80159955 target=_blank rel=noopener>Check out</a> Force 2 on Netflix</p><h2 id=34-bhool-bhulaiyaa-2007>34. Bhool Bhulaiyaa (2007)</h2><p>Bhool Bhulaiyaa is the sort of movie that you will enjoy watching time and again. This <strong>comedy horror film is an official remake of the 1993 Malayalam film Manichitrathazhu.</strong> The movie is about an NRI and his wife who decide to live in an ancestral house ignoring the warnings about ghosts. And when unexpected things start taking place, he has to take the help of a psychiatrist (Akshay Kumar) to solve the mystery. Due mainly to the fascinating story, the film <strong>received universal critical acclaim</strong> and also proved to be a massive hit. Moreover, Vidya Balan’s performance is considered one of her best.</p><p><a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/in/title/70082633 target=_blank rel=noopener>Check out</a> Bhool Bhulaiyaa on Netflix</p><h2 id=35-parmanu-the-story-of-pokhran-2018>35. Parmanu: The Story of Pokhran (2018)</h2><p>For the folks who are on the lookout for a scintillating <strong>historical action drama film</strong>, “Parmanu: The Story of Pokhran” appears to be a fine bet. The film is directed by Abhishek Sharma and features John Abraham, Diana Penty and Boman Irani in major roles. If you haven’t already guessed it, let me tell you that it’s based on the <strong>nuclear bomb test explosions conducted by the Indian Army</strong> at Pokhran in 1998 during Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s government. In a nutshell, Parmanu is an ode to the amazing bravery of the Indian Army and the resolute scientists.</p><p><a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/in/title/81005453 target=_blank rel=noopener>Check out</a> Parmanu: The Story of Pokhran on Netflix</p><h2 id=36-veerey-ki-wedding-2018>36. Veerey Ki Wedding (2018)</h2><p>Hunting for some light-hearted romantic-comedy movie? If yes, why not give a chance to Veerey Ki Wedding as it’s got both <strong>a ton of comedies and plenty of romantic twists</strong> to light up your showtime. The film showcases the marriage adventure of Veer Arora (Pulkit Samrat) who is madly in love with a ‘dilli ki kudi’ Geet (Kriti Kharbanda) and wants to marry her. But things take an <strong>unexpected turn during meet-the-parents session.</strong></p><p><a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/in/title/81213873 target=_blank rel=noopener>Check out</a> Veerey Ki Wedding on Netflix</p><h2 id=37-judwaa-2-2017>37. Judwaa 2 (2017)</h2><p>Judwaa 2 is a <strong>reboot of the 1997 superhit film Judwaa</strong> starring Salman Khan. The movie has been directed by David Dhawan and features Varun Dhawan, Jacqueline Fernandez and Taapsee Pannu in the lead roles. It follows the life of Raja and Prem <strong>(the completely contrasting twins who were separated at birth but are connected through reflexes)</strong> who come together as adults to fight an underground smuggling kingpin to save their family. Varun looks spot on in the dual-avatar, while Jacqueline and Taapsee have performed their parts elegantly which makes the action-comedy a nice watch. Bole to paisa vasool (worth the money you pay)!</p><p><a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/in/title/80236906 target=_blank rel=noopener>Check out</a> Judwaa 2 on Netflix</p><h2 id=38-toilet-ek-prem-katha-2017>38. Toilet: Ek Prem Katha (2017)</h2><p>As a satirical comedy, “Toilet: Ek Prem Katha” has lived up to my billing. And rightly so as the movie is a pretty interesting <strong>representation of government campaigns to improve sanitation conditions in India</strong> with the sole focus on the elimination of the open defecation. With an impressive cast led by the likes of Akshay Kumar, Bhumi Pednekar, Anupam Kher, and Sudhir Pandey, the film succeeds in highlighting India’s toilet problem with a great mix of love and comedy. So, it deserves a shot in this roundup of the top Bollywood movies on Netflix.</p><p><a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/in/title/80199962 target=_blank rel=noopener>Check out</a> Toilet: Ek Prem Katha on Netflix</p><h2 id=39-3-idiots-2009>39. 3 Idiots (2009)</h2><p>No matter how many times you have streamed 3 Idiots, you may fall for it every time it’s on the horizon. So, I’m not going to miss out on this <strong>coming-of-age comedy-drama</strong> that’s undoubtedly one of the best Bollywood movies on Netflix. Directed by Rajkumar Hirani, the film features Aamir Khan, Madhavan, Sharman Joshi, Kareena Kapoor, and Boman Irani in major roles. As for the plot, it revolves around <strong>three students at an Indian engineering college</strong> giving a satirical touch to the social pressures under an Indian education system.</p><p><a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/title/70121522 target=_blank rel=noopener>Check out</a> 3 Idiots on Netflix</p><h2 id=40-tamasha-2015>40. Tamasha (2015)</h2><p>If a modern romantic film is what you are willing to stream, Tamasha would be my recommendation for multiple reasons. First and foremost, this movie is about <strong>real-life ex-flames: Ranbir Kapoor and Deepika Padukone</strong>. The film (directed by Imtiaz Ali) is set around Ved Vardhan Sahni (Ranbir) and showcases his life in three different stages: a nine-year-old child, a 19-year-old teenager, and a 30-year-old adult. With <strong>A.R Rahman’s soundtrack</strong> and Irshad Kamil’s lyrics, Tamasha won’t fail to touch your heart, should you have a penchant for romantic flicks.</p><p><a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/in/title/80087743 target=_blank rel=noopener>Check out</a> Tamasha on Netflix</p><h2 id=enjoy-these-great-netflix-hindi-movies>Enjoy These Great Netflix Hindi Movies</h2><p>The 40 movies that I have mentioned in this list are some of the best movies Bollywood has ever produced.
