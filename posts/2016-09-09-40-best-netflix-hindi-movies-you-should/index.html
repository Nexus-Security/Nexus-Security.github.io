href=https://beebom.com/best-netflix-movies/ target=_blank rel=noopener>feature international movies</a> and <a class=link href=https://beebom.com/best-tv-series-on-netflix/ target=_blank rel=noopener>shows</a> but also offers a great selection of Indian movies. The catalog of Indian movies on Netflix is second to none, with the service offering some of the best movies that Bollywood has ever produced. So, if you are a Bollywood movie aficionado or want to play a movie for your family, you will find some really good options on Netflix. So, if you are looking to indulge yourself with some good Netflix Hindi movies, here are the 40 best Bollywood movies on Netflix you can watch in 2020.</p><h2 id=best-netflix-hindi-movies-in-2020>Best Netflix Hindi Movies in 2020</h2><h2 id=1-the-lunchbox-2013>1. The Lunchbox (2013)</h2><p>Let’s start our article with one of the most under-rated and a gem of a movie produced by Bollywood which is The Lunchbox. The story of Lunchbox revolves around an Indian housewife and an older man. The movie starts with a simple premise. <strong>What if the critically acclaimed Mumbai Dabbawala misplaced a lunchbox?</strong> With this simple hook, we are led into a story which is full of love, family, and emotions and takes you on a journey that you will never be able to forget. What happens you ask? Well, you will have to watch the movie to find out, won’t you? The Lunchbox is one of the best Netflix hindi movies to watch.</p><p><a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/title/70278932 target=_blank rel=noopener>Check out</a> The Lunchbox on Netflix</p><h2 id=2-queen-2014>2. Queen (2014)</h2><p>One of my favorite Hindi movies of all time is Queen. The story revolves around a traditional family girl who has never set her foot out of her comfort zone and now decided to tour Europe on her own. What forces her to take this step and what happens afterward is the whole story of the movie. The <a class=link href=https://beebom.com/best-comedy-movies-on-netflix/ target=_blank rel=noopener>movie is hilarious</a> and sad at the same time. <strong>Kangana Ranawat who plays the lead character Rani has killed with her performance in this movie</strong>. This is one Netflix Hindi movie that you won’t regret watching.</p><p><a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/title/80032081 target=_blank rel=noopener>Check out</a> Queen on Netflix</p><h2 id=3-manto-2018>3. Manto (2018)</h2><p>Manto is the <strong>life story of controversial and troubled Indo-Pakistani writer Sadat Hussain Manto</strong>. The story focuses on the artistic and censorship challenges faced by the writers while he was creating his work. The main character Manto is being played by ever awesome Nawazuddin Siddiqui and might I say it is his one of the best performances yet. The plot is gripping and will hold you till the last minute. I enjoyed watching this movie a lot and highly recommend to all Netflix viewers.</p><p><a class=link href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81039383?so=su" target=_blank rel=noopener>Check Out</a> Manto on Netflix</p><h2 id=4-special-26-2013>4. Special 26 (2013)</h2><p>While Hollywood is full of great con movies, it’s something that Bollywood has never been able to get right, that is until Special 26 hit the theaters. Starring Akshay Kumar, t<strong>he movie revolves around a con man and his team who pose as CBI and Income Tax officers</strong> to rob prominent rich businessmen and politicians who are evading tax. If you love con movies and are looking for good Netflix Hindi movies, you are going to love this one.</p><p><a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/title/70273637 target=_blank rel=noopener>Check Out</a> Special 26 on Netflix</p><h2 id=5-no-one-killed-jessica-2011>5. No One Killed Jessica (2011)</h2><p>Released in 2011, No One Killed Jessica might be quite old but the storyline still holds true. The story revolves around a girl who is trying to get justice for the murder of her younger sister. <strong>You will see betrayal, corruption, and everything else that we have come to expect from India’s criminal justice system</strong>. This is a must watch who likes a good thriller movie.</p><p><a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/title/70139076 target=_blank rel=noopener>Check out</a> No One Killed Jessica on Netflix</p><h2 id=6-brahman-naman-2018>6. Brahman Naman (2018)</h2><p>If you love raunchy comedy movies, then this one is just for you. The movie doesn’t boast of any A-list actors or directors but what it does pack is <strong>a tight and gripping storyline which will leave you in tears with laughter.</strong> The story revolves around a group of young men who are a part of a quiz team and are looking to lose their virginity. While this move is not for everyone, if you love raunchy comedies, you should definitely see it once.</p><p><a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/title/80097355 target=_blank rel=noopener>Check out</a> Brahman on Netflix</p><h2 id=7-bareilly-ki-barfi-2017>7. Bareilly ki Barfi (2017)</h2><p>Released in 2017, Bareilly ki Barfi is a movie which will tickle your funny bones in all the right places. Boasting of a talented star cast including Ayushmann Khurrana, Kriti Sanon, Rajkummar Rao, and my favorite Pankaj Tripathi, <strong>the story revolves around Bitti who is a free-spirited small-town girl who lives her life on her own terms</strong>. What happens to her when she meets Chirag Dubey (Ayushman) and Pritam Vidrohi (Rajkumar Rao) is the whole movie. This one is an entertainment bomb.</p><p><a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/title/81016193 target=_blank rel=noopener>Check out</a> Bareilly ki Barfi</p><h2 id=8-pad-man-2018>8. Pad Man (2018)</h2><p>Pad Man is the real-life story of Arunachalam Muruganantham who created a cheap solution for sanitary pads aiming to help millions of women in India. The main character is played by Akshay Kumar who is excellent on screen and <strong>exceptionally displays the trials and tribulations that Muruganantham had to face in real life</strong>.

Mom (2017)</h2><p>Mom is the last work of Bollywood superstar Sridevi who sadly passed away this year. The story revolves around a mother (played by Sridevi) who is exacting revenge on a group of boys who attacked her daughter and escape justice. <strong>While the movie follows a by the number revenge plot, the exceptional and heart-wrenching performance of Sridevi makes it worth watching</strong>.

No movie has ended on such a cliffhanger as Bahubali. <strong>The period drama featuring Prabhas has been directed by the critically acclaimed, S.S. Rajamouli</strong>. While this is not technically a Bollywood movie, it was made in collaboration with Dharma Production, and I had to include it on this list.</p><p>Check Out (<a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/title/80204117 target=_blank rel=noopener>1</a> / <a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/title/80203996 target=_blank rel=noopener>2</a>) Bahubali on Netflix</p><h2 id=15-dear-zindagi-2016>15. Dear Zindagi (2016)</h2><p>I had stopped expecting good movies from Shahrukh Khan after Chennai express and I was mostly right. However, the release of Dear Zindagi changed all that. <strong>Seeing Shahrukh in a story driven plot is something of an anomaly these days and hence Dear Zindagi is a must watch</strong>. Propelled by a gripping storyline and great performances from Alia Bhatt and Shahrukh Khan, this is a movie that you don’t want to miss.</p><p><a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/title/80158042 target=_blank rel=noopener>Check out</a> Dear Zindagi on Netflix</p><h2 id=16-pk>16.

Gurgaon (2017)</h2><p>A Netflix original Hindi movie, Gurgaon features an awesome acting performance from its star cast. Pankaj Tripathi is especially great in this movie. <strong>The plot of the movie revolves around kidnapping and is as gripping as a crime thriller can be</strong>. The movie focuses on human character and how mean and dark we humans can get.

Dangal (2016)</h2><p>I don’t think there are too many Bollywood sports films that are as memorable as Dangal. Mr. perfectionist “Aamir Khan” has excelled in his role as a <strong>former wrestler (Mahavir Singh)</strong> who pursues the gold medal he never won by training his two strong-willed daughters named Geeta Phogat and Babita Kumari. Set in the Indian state of Haryana, the film is loosely <strong>based on the Phogat family</strong> and its tryst with the coveted medals at the Commonwealth Games.

The film is directed by Abhishek Sharma and features John Abraham, Diana Penty and Boman Irani in major roles. If you haven’t already guessed it, let me tell you that it’s based on the <strong>nuclear bomb test explosions conducted by the Indian Army</strong> at Pokhran in 1998 during Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s government. In a nutshell, Parmanu is an ode to the amazing bravery of the Indian Army and the resolute scientists.</p><p><a class=link href=https://www.netflix.com/in/title/81005453 target=_blank rel=noopener>Check out</a> Parmanu: The Story of Pokhran on Netflix</p><h2 id=36-veerey-ki-wedding-2018>36.

The movie has been directed by David Dhawan and features Varun Dhawan, Jacqueline Fernandez and Taapsee Pannu in the lead roles. It follows the life of Raja and Prem <strong>(the completely contrasting twins who were separated at birth but are connected through reflexes)</strong> who come together as adults to fight an underground smuggling kingpin to save their family. Varun looks spot on in the dual-avatar, while Jacqueline and Taapsee have performed their parts elegantly which makes the action-comedy a nice watch.

Toilet: Ek Prem Katha (2017)</h2><p>As a satirical comedy, “Toilet: Ek Prem Katha” has lived up to my billing. And rightly so as the movie is a pretty interesting <strong>representation of government campaigns to improve sanitation conditions in India</strong> with the sole focus on the elimination of the open defecation. With an impressive cast led by the likes of Akshay Kumar, Bhumi Pednekar, Anupam Kher, and Sudhir Pandey, the film succeeds in highlighting India’s toilet problem with a great mix of love and comedy.

Tamasha (2015)</h2><p>If a modern romantic film is what you are willing to stream, Tamasha would be my recommendation for multiple reasons. First and foremost, this movie is about <strong>real-life ex-flames: Ranbir Kapoor and Deepika Padukone</strong>. The film (directed by Imtiaz Ali) is set around Ved Vardhan Sahni (Ranbir) and showcases his life in three different stages: a nine-year-old child, a 19-year-old teenager, and a 30-year-old adult.
