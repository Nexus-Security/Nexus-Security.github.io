However, if you&rsquo;re looking at this guide and you&rsquo;re not actually up to Episode 7 yet, then it goes without saying that you&rsquo;re going to be at least a little bit spoiled scrolling through here. <strong>TURN AWAY NOW IF YOU&rsquo;RE NOT UP TO EPISODE 4.</strong></p><p>Now the thing to keep in mind is that a big part of Death Stranding is the flexibility of the environment and the creativity of how you want to forge a path forward. There are a whole heap of different ways to tackle each mission, and on top of that, the map you encounter might also be different to the one you see in this guide&ndash;that&rsquo;s thanks to the multiplayer aspect of the game, where members of the community will clear different paths and place helpful structures in different ways depending on your personal game.</p><p>That said, this walkthrough will give you a good idea about what you need to do.

At the end of the last episode, we were just about to meet up with Guillermo Del Toro at his cabin and have a nice night in together, and now we&rsquo;re… here? What happened?</p><p>Well, no time to sit around and soak in the atmosphere, time to go to the sewers!</p><p>You&rsquo;ll notice that all the cargo you were carrying will be scattered across the street ahead (and potentially behind you). Move briskly from cover to cover and grab your stuff.</p><p>If you still have access to the armor plates you got from the Photographer last episode, equip them. If you need to leave some stuff behind, choose stuff that isn&rsquo;t useful for combat because, surprise, you&rsquo;re in a warzone.</p><h2 id=episode-7---tanks-for-the-memories>Episode 7 - Tanks For The Memories</h2><p><img src=https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/172/1720905/3603542-ds-episode07-00026.jpg loading=lazy></p><h3 id=heading-2></h3><p>The street will open up a larger avenue where you&rsquo;ll see some tanks rolling by.

On the far end, on the right hand side, you&rsquo;ll see a set of stairs leading down to it.</p><p>The entrance to the sewer, where you need to be, is just on the opposite side of the canal (you can just see it in this screenshot in the top-left)</p><h2 id=episode-7---shine-a-light>Episode 7 - Shine A Light</h2><p><img src=https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/172/1720905/3603545-ds-episode07-00029.jpg loading=lazy></p><h3 id=heading-5></h3><p>Once you&rsquo;re down in the sewers, your odradek will turn into a spotlight.

Make your way through with confidence.</p><h2 id=episode-7---stock-up>Episode 7 - Stock Up</h2><p><img src=https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/172/1720905/3603546-ds-episode07-00030.jpg loading=lazy></p><h3 id=heading-6></h3><p>Have you been noticing the blood bags and grenades strewn around down here? Make sure to pick them up! You&rsquo;re going to need them soon.</p><p>The blood bag pictured in this screenshot is on a ledge, and just past that you&rsquo;ll find a set of stairs that will lead straight to your next objective and a cutscene.</p><h2 id=episode-7---reunited-at-last>Episode 7 - Reunited At Last</h2><p><img src=https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/172/1720905/3603547-ds-episode07-00031.jpg loading=lazy></p><h3 id=heading-7></h3><p>Hey, look at that!

Hematic rounds will drain your blood, meaning you&rsquo;ll have less health in reserve. Regular rounds are fine for this section.</p><h2 id=episode-7---dont-make-me-do-this-mads>Episode 7 - Don&rsquo;t Make Me Do This, Mads!</h2><p><img src=https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/172/1720905/3603550-ds-episode07-00034.jpg loading=lazy></p><h3 id=heading-10></h3><p>Mads Mikkelsen will be amongst those soldiers, but he&rsquo;s far more aggressive. So play it safe, stay behind cover so you can take a breather if you need to, and take him down (remember, the game will go into slow motion to confirm your kills)</p><p>At the end of this fight, you might notice that you&rsquo;re running out of ammunition. Thankfully, there are additional guns and grenades strewn across the arena, and I definitely recommend you make it a priority to pick them up and make sure you always have a spare weapon on hand&ndash;punching these enemies isn&rsquo;t exactly an effective tactic.</p><p>Follow your odradek in order to track down where your next fight will be. Mads will also leave red footprints, which can be tracked after an odradek scan.</p><h2 id=episode-7---mad-mikkelsen>Episode 7 - Mad Mikkelsen</h2><p><img src=https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/172/1720905/3603551-ds-episode07-00035.jpg loading=lazy></p><h3 id=heading-11></h3><p>Now, be aware that Mads has a couple of new tricks up his sleeve from the last time you saw him in Episode 7. He now has a kind of flame projectile he can send your way to damage you (pictured) and he can quickly create new soldiers to hassle you with if you leave him alone for long enough.</p><p>My strategy here was to keep moving, for one, and to try and close the distance quickly and take advantage of the shotgun&rsquo;s fast firing rate and reload&ndash;he&rsquo;ll stagger for half a second and it&rsquo;s easy to keep him in this loop if your shots are mostly on-target.</p><h2 id=episode-7---grenade-me-maybe>Episode 7 - Grenade Me, Maybe</h2><p><img src=https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/172/1720905/3603552-ds-episode07-00036.jpg loading=lazy></p><h3 id=heading-12></h3><p>If you manage to track Mads&rsquo; footprints and have a good idea of where the next cluster of soldiers will be, using a grenade can make quick work of them.</p><p>You&rsquo;ll need to take him and his soldiers down a total of three times, so make sure you&rsquo;re stocking up on spare weapons and blood packs around the arena.</p><h2 id=episode-7---another-shower>Episode 7 - Another Shower</h2><p><img src=https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/172/1720905/3603553-ds-episode07-00002.jpg loading=lazy></p><h3 id=heading-13></h3><p>Once you&rsquo;re done taking care of Mads, you&rsquo;ll be treated to a few cutscenes and find yourself back in the private room. Take a shower to continue. This game is all about showering now.</p><p>Leave your room when the game lets you stop showering.</p><h2 id=episode-7---time-to-find-the-heart>Episode 7 - Time To Find The Heart</h2><p><img src=https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/172/1720905/3603566-ds-episode07-00003.jpg loading=lazy></p><h3 id=heading-14></h3><p>But wait! This episode isn&rsquo;t over yet, we still have one more big mountain hike to do!</p><p>We&rsquo;re going to visit our pal Heartman in the flesh, and guess where he lives? Oh, do you think it might be next to the <strong><em>ridiculously enormous lake shaped like a freaking heart</em></strong> just south of Mountain Knot City?</p><p>Yeah. Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s right.</p><h2 id=episode-7---corpse-party-aint-over>Episode 7 - Corpse Party Ain&rsquo;t Over</h2><p><img src=https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/172/1720905/3603567-ds-episode07-00004.jpg loading=lazy></p><h3 id=heading-15></h3><p>Oh look, and Heartman wants you to deliver a corpse to him. That&rsquo;s just swell.</p><p>Climbing up mountains with a corpse on your back will be extra troublesome because of their tendency to throw you off balance more easily, but thankfully, we still have that intricate system of zip lines we established all around the mountains from last episode to help us out. Right? Am I right?</p><p>Before you head out, make sure you&rsquo;re wearing your all-terrain legs and power gloves. Stock up on Level 2 PCCs just in case you need to continue to expand the intricate series of zip lines you established in the last chapter.</p><p>If you don&rsquo;t have many zip lines set up, and you&rsquo;ll be climbing up in a more manual fashion, note that you&rsquo;ll have to stash your climbing gear in a floating carrier&ndash;the corpse must be carried on your back.</p><h2 id=episode-7---zip-line-friends>Episode 7 - Zip Line Friends!</h2><p><img src=https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/172/1720905/3603568-ds-episode07-00005.jpg loading=lazy></p><h3 id=heading-16></h3><p>You can either head directly south of Mountain Knot City up the steep, snowy mountain to get a head start, or head over to the Doctor&rsquo;s place for a roundabout, but more gradual route up (you&rsquo;ll likey need to use quite a few ladders and climbing anchors to safely tackle the ups and downs.)</p><p>If you do take this slightly longer route, rest assured that once you hit the snow, it&rsquo;s an easier (albeit steep) route.</p><p>OR you can be a cool person and ride that sweet zip line over to the Doctor&rsquo;s place and up the mountain!</p><h2 id=episode-7---wheeeee>Episode 7 - Wheeeee!</h2><p><img src=https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/172/1720905/3603569-ds-episode07-00007.jpg loading=lazy></p><h3 id=heading-17></h3><p>Do you think the corpse is enjoying this rush as much as Norman Reedus is?</p><h2 id=episode-7---reedus-express-coming-through>Episode 7 - Reedus Express, Coming Through!</h2><p><img src=https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/172/1720905/3603571-ds-episode07-00011.jpg loading=lazy></p><h3 id=heading-18></h3><p>Almost there!</p><h2 id=episode-7---and-here-we-are>Episode 7 - And Here We Are!</h2><p><img src=https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/172/1720905/3603570-ds-episode07-00010.jpg loading=lazy></p><h3 id=heading-19></h3><p>So easy, am I right?

Our Episode 8 walkthrough will be coming in shortly, so stay tuned for that!</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-copyright><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="icon icon-tabler icon-tabler-copyright" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="2" stroke="currentcolor" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path stroke="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="9"/><path d="M14.5 9a3.5 4 0 100 6"/></svg><span>Licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</span></section></footer></article><footer class=site-footer><section class=copyright>&copy;
