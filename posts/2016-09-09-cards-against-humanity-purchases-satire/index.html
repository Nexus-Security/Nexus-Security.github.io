loading=lazy></p><p>Cards Against Humanity, the card game company, purchased ClickHole.com from its owners at G/O Media on Monday for an undisclosed amount in an all-cash deal, BuzzFeed News has learned. ClickHole‚Äôs employees will become the majority owners of the site. Although terms were not disclosed, the Wall Street Journal <a class=link href=https://www.wsj.com/articles/deadspin-resignations-threaten-new-owners-turnaround-11572658871 target=_blank rel=noopener>reported in November</a> that the sale price was likely to be less than $1 million. The Onion, which created ClickHole, will remain a part of G/O Media.</p><p>Max Temkin, the cofounder of Cards Against Humanity, told BuzzFeed News that the deal will allow ClickHole to bring on additional staff ‚Äî it currently has only five full-time employees ‚Äî and explore new revenue streams. He also said the site would operate independently, with financial support from Cards Against Humanity. ClickHole staffers will not be involved in writing any Cards Against Humanity content.</p><p>A spokesperson for G/O Media confirmed the deal to BuzzFeed News.</p><p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre giving them funding, and if they ask us, we‚Äôll be an advisor,‚Äù Temkin told BuzzFeed News, saying that the ClickHole team will operate independently, with financial support. ‚ÄúWe just want to give them a chance to do their thing. They‚Äôre really capable ‚Äî really smart and innovative. And I don&rsquo;t know if they‚Äôve had that opportunity before to try all these creative [ideas for the site].‚Äù</p><p>Steve Etheridge, editor-in-chief of ClickHole, told BuzzFeed News, ‚Äúwe&rsquo;re leaving a place with a very robust editorial infrastructure to essentially go build a new digital media company from scratch. Cards is giving us total freedom to do our thing, but that freedom comes with a lot of new responsibility, and we really just want to get it right. Our goal is to make ClickHole better than ever before.‚Äù</p><p>The Onion launched ClickHole in 2014 as a send-up of sites like Upworthy and BuzzFeed. It moved on to satirizing online political discourse with PatriotHole and ResistanceHole. Yet it has consistently transcended mere parody and created its own sublimely absurd universe. Quizzes like ‚ÄúWhich One of My Garbage Sons Are You?‚Äù or its running series of fake banal quotes from celebrities earned it a loyal, independent following.</p><p>In its short existence, ClickHole has changed hands multiple times. Univision purchased its parent company, Onion Inc., in 2016. That same year, Univision also purchased what was left of Gawker Media. Univision later sold many of its assets, including ClickHole, as well as sites like Jezebel, Deadspin, and the Root to private equity firm Great Hill Partners as G/O Media. The transition has not been smooth. Two of the most senior staffers at ClickHole were laid off by new management in April 2019. G/O Media writers have routinely criticized and <a class=link href=https://johncook.kinja.com/jim-spanfeller-is-a-herb-by-emma-carmichael-1839545670 target=_blank rel=noopener>mocked</a> the company‚Äôs CEO, Jim Spanfeller. Politics site Splinter was shuttered, and after a feud with management over editorial independence, the <a class=link href=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/01/business/deadspin-staff-quits.html target=_blank rel=noopener>entire staff</a> of Deadspin quit.</p><p>‚ÄúWe will be sad to leave all our friends at The Onion except for this one guy Nick, who sucks,‚Äù Etheridge told BuzzFeed News. ‚ÄúThe good news is that security at The Onion office is very poor, so we can break in and visit our friends any time we want."</p><p>‚ÄúOur goal is to take some of the pressure off of them so they can shake some of these managerial shakes ups they‚Äôve had and just focus on making amazing comedy,‚Äù Temkin told BuzzFeed News.</p><p>Both Cards Against Humanity and ClickHole are based in Chicago, and according to Temkin, their staffs have known one another from the local comedy scene for years, which led to discussions of the sale in 2019.</p><p>Cards Against Humanity was created by Temkin and his high school friends in 2012 and was an early Kickstarter hit. Its popularity spread by word of mouth and on the <a class=link href=https://www.buzzfeed.com/awesomer/times-cards-against-humanity-was-too-real target=_blank rel=noopener>internet</a>. It has also come in for a lot of <a class=link href=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/07/magazine/letter-of-complaint-cards-against-humanity.html target=_blank rel=noopener>criticism</a> that its cards contain racist or anti-trans jokes. A card for ‚Äúpassable transvestites‚Äù was removed <a class=link href=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/rachelzarrell/theres-one-cards-against-humanity-card-the-creator-regrets-m target=_blank rel=noopener>from the game</a>, and <a class=link href=https://www.tmz.com/2017/12/29/target-apologizes-anti-semetic-cards-against-humanity-game/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Target stopped</a> selling a Jewish-themed expansion pack after complaints that it was anti-Semitic. Temkin was <a class=link href=https://gawker.com/remember-when-the-cards-against-humanity-guy-was-accuse-1621559973 target=_blank rel=noopener>accused</a> of sexual assault in 2014, an allegation he <a class=link href=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-case-against-cards-against-humanity-is-max-temkin-a-horrible-person target=_blank rel=noopener>denied</a>. The company also waded into controversy in 2017 when it <a class=link href=https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/15/us/cards-against-humanity-land-grab-trnd/index.html target=_blank rel=noopener>purchased a plot of land</a> along the US‚ÄìMexico border in an effort to set up a legal fight over Trump&rsquo;s border wall.</p><p>This won‚Äôt be the first venture outside of card games for Cards Against Humanity. This year, it plans to open a board game‚Äìthemed <a class=link href=https://chicago.eater.com/2020/1/16/21069199/cards-against-humanity-restaurant-chicago-board-game-cafe-info-town-square-games-food-drink-preview target=_blank rel=noopener>bar and restaurant</a> in Chicago.</p><p>As for the sale price, Etheridge said, ‚ÄúClickHole was incredibly expensive because we are the only website in the world that has <a class=link href="https://www.clickhole.com/clickholes-treasure-1826617007?rev=1580409038683" target=_blank rel=noopener>treasure</a>.
