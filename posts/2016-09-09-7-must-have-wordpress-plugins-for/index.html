By automating some of your workflow, you can keep your blog running smoothly with fresh content and tools for building your audience.</p><p>Below, we’ve shared some must-have plugins for WordPress bloggers. They’ll help you with a variety of key responsibilities, including managing your social media platforms and sourcing content. Let’s get started!</p><h2 id=1-yoast-seohttpswordpressorgpluginswordpress-seo>1. <a class=link href=https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Yoast SEO</a></h2><p><img src=https://wpmayor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yoast-seo-plugin.png loading=lazy alt="The Yoast SEO plugin."></p><p><a class=link href=https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Yoast SEO</a> is one of the most popular and well-known WordPress plugins. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) can be tricky, so having some guidance available right in your WordPress dashboard is extremely helpful. This plugin is an asset to any type of website, but particularly for those that have large volumes of content.</p><p>Making sure your content is picked up by search engines can provide a significant boost in your site’s visibility. Yoast provides suggestions right in the WordPress editor about optimizing your posts for keywords and improving their readability:</p><p><img src=https://wpmayor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yoast-readbility.png loading=lazy alt="The readability suggestions in Yoast SEO."></p><p>Some of the other features this plugin provides include:</p><ul><li>Previews of your posts in Google search results</li><li>Breadcrumbs for improving your site’s navigation</li><li>Duplicate content prevention to avoid repeat URLs</li></ul><p>Especially if your blog is still small, getting started with the free version of Yoast is ideal. However, the <a class=link href=https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/ target=_blank rel=noopener>premium plugin</a> includes many <a class=link href=https://wpmayor.com/top-3-seo-optimization-plugins-free-vs-premium-version/ target=_blank rel=noopener>additional features</a> that will help boost your site’s visibility further. It provides internal linking suggestions and notifies you about outdated posts. Licenses start at $89 per year.</p><p>There are other SEO plugins out there that are also gaining in popularity, so if you’ve used any others that are worth mentioning, please share them in the comments below.</p><h2 id=2-blog2socialhttpswpmayorcomlinkblog2social>2. <a class=link href=https://wpmayor.com/link/blog2social/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Blog2Social</a></h2><p><img src=https://wpmayor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/blog2social-plugin.png loading=lazy alt="The Blog2Social plugin."></p><p>Social media is a powerful way to connect with your blog’s readers. Posting regularly isn’t always easy, however. <a class=link href=https://wpmayor.com/link/blog2social/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Blog2Social</a> automatically shares new blog content on your social accounts so your followers can stay up-to-date on your latest activity.</p><p>Without an audience, a blog isn’t as meaningful. Growing your following creates more opportunities for you to monetize your posts and connect with readers. Social media is one way to draw recurring visitors back to your site on a regular basis, and <a class=link href=https://wpmayor.com/blog2social-review-easily-share-wordpress-content-on-social-media/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Blog2Social can help</a>.</p><p>Beyond automating posts for new content, this plugin can also:</p><ul><li>Schedule social media posts for high-traffic times to increase visibility</li><li>Customize posts with hashtags, emojis, and more</li><li>Re-post older content to renew interest in it</li></ul><p>The free version covers all the basics – 13 networks including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest as well as all the features listed above. With <a class=link href=https://wpmayor.com/link/blog2social/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Blog2Social Premium</a>, however, you can also manage your <a class=link href=https://www.google.com/business/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Google My Business</a> profile, schedule curated content, and create a social media calendar. Plans start at $79 per year.</p><h2 id=3-all-in-one-wp-security--firewallhttpswordpressorgpluginsall-in-one-wp-security-and-firewall>3. <a class=link href=https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-wp-security-and-firewall/ target=_blank rel=noopener>All In One WP Security & Firewall</a></h2><p><img src=https://wpmayor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/wp-security-firewall.png loading=lazy alt="The All In One WP Security & Firewall plugin."></p><p>WordPress security is a must no matter what type of site you have. However, there are some particular concerns bloggers have to consider. In addition to the usual risks of hackers and malware, you’ll have to find ways to protect your content from thieves who might try to pass it off as their own.</p><p>There are many WordPress security plugins out there, but <a class=link href=https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-wp-security-and-firewall/ target=_blank rel=noopener>All In One WP Security & Firewall</a> lets you disable right-clicking on your website. This prevents visitors from copying and pasting the posts you worked to create into their own websites.</p><p>It can also handle your security basics, such as:</p><ul><li>Brute force attack prevention with login attempt limits</li><li>File scanning to search for malware</li><li>Firewall protection to prevent malicious scripts from reaching your site’s code</li></ul><p>This plugin is completely free. However, keep in mind that one security plugin isn’t enough to protect your site completely. Make sure to look <a class=link href=https://wpmayor.com/wordpress-security-beyond-wordpress-security-plugins/ target=_blank rel=noopener>beyond plugins</a> for ways to keep your site safe, too.</p><h2 id=4-akismethttpswordpressorgpluginsakismet>4. <a class=link href=https://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Akismet</a></h2><p><img src=https://wpmayor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/akismet-plugin.png loading=lazy alt="The Akismet plugin."></p><p><a class=link href=https://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Akismet</a> is a spam-prevention plugin. It checks your site’s comments and forms submissions for suspicious content. Your blog’s readers will hopefully be engaging with your site in these ways, so making sure they’re clear of malicious links is key.</p><p>Spam can include links to low-quality sites, hidden malware downloads, or even just comments that aren’t relevant to your blog. Keeping your posts free of these annoying and sometimes dangerous things will improve the reading experience for your visitors and your site’s security as well.</p><p>Akismet can help moderate your comments by:</p><ul><li>Showing a status history for each comment, so you can see which ones have been marked as spam</li><li>Displaying the URLs of any links included, revealing any that may be misleading to readers</li><li>Enabling you to discard the worst spam comments and block them completely so they don’t take up server space or impact performance</li></ul><p>You can sign up for an Akismet personal plan – which is recommended for blogs – for free. There are also plans for <a class=link href=https://akismet.com/wordpress/ target=_blank rel=noopener>business and enterprise-level sites</a> available for a monthly rate of $5 or $50, respectively.</p><h2 id=5-wp-scheduled-postshttpswpmayorcomlinkwp-scheduled-posts>5. <a class=link href=https://wpmayor.com/link/wp-scheduled-posts/ target=_blank rel=noopener>WP Scheduled Posts</a></h2><p><img src=https://wpmayor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/schedule-posts-plugin.png loading=lazy alt="The WP Scheduled Posts plugin."></p><p>You can’t have a blog without posts. Ideally, you’ll want to <a class=link href=https://wpmayor.com/how-to-manage-your-content-with-wp-scheduled-posts/ target=_blank rel=noopener>create a schedule</a> so that your site is regularly updated with fresh content. This requires a fair amount of forethought, planning, and organization to maintain.</p><p>A calendar is a simple way to keep your future posts and content strategy on track, and <a class=link href=https://wpmayor.com/link/wp-scheduled-posts/ target=_blank rel=noopener>WP Scheduled Posts</a> adds one right in your WordPress dashboard:</p><p><img src=https://wpmayor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/scheduled-posts-calendar.png loading=lazy alt="A scheduled posts calendar."></p><p>It also enables you to create and schedule posts from your calendar, so you can have an overview of your blog’s upcoming content while you continue to plan ahead. Plus, you can automate publication to get posts up on time even if you have to be away from your computer.</p><p>WP Scheduled Posts includes:</p><ul><li>A dashboard widget that displays upcoming publications</li><li>Drag-and-drop functionality in the posts calendar for easy scheduling</li><li>Easy multi-author management, as you can see everyone’s posts from the calendar</li></ul><p>The free version of this plugin works just fine for single-author sites and those with time to check in on their blogs daily. However, <a class=link href=https://wpmayor.com/link/wp-scheduled-posts/ target=_blank rel=noopener>WP Scheduled Posts Pro</a> includes additional automation for those with bigger sites.</p><p>This premium plugin enables you to specify the time interval between posts and then auto-schedules them. It also includes a ‘missed schedule handler’ to catch and publish any content that slips through the cracks. Licenses start at $39 per year, with a 25 percent renewal discount.</p><h2 id=6-google-analytics-dashboardhttpswpmayorcomlinkmonster-insights-by-monsterinsights>6. <a class=link href=https://wpmayor.com/link/monster-insights/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Google Analytics Dashboard</a> by MonsterInsights</h2><p><img src=https://wpmayor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/google-analytics-plugin.png loading=lazy alt="The Google Analytics Dashboard plugin by MonsterInsights."></p><p>An important part of succeeding as a blogger is driving traffic. Understanding how your readers are finding their way to your site can help you step up your marketing strategy to draw in new visitors. <a class=link href=https://analytics.google.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Google Analytics</a> is one of the most popular platforms for tracking user behavior for this purpose:</p><p><img src=https://wpmayor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/google-analytics-dashboard.png loading=lazy alt="The Google Analytics dashboard."></p><p>The drawback of this is that you have to bounce back and forth between your WordPress dashboard and your Google Analytics account. With <a class=link href=https://wpmayor.com/link/monster-insights/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Google Analytics Dashboard</a> by MonsterInsights, however, you can view the most <a class=link href=https://wpmayor.com/best-google-analytics-plugins-wordpress/ target=_blank rel=noopener>important user data from your site’s back end</a>.</p><p>This plugin can also help you:</p><ul><li>Simplify the Google Analytics setup process so you don’t have to manually add code to your site</li><li>View content reports seeing which of your posts are attracting the most attention</li><li>Use author tracking to see which writers are the most popular on multi-author blogs</li></ul><p>The free version of Google Analytics Dashboard displays four pieces of information – the number of sessions and pageviews for the past 30 days, the average session duration, and your current bounce rate. However, Google Analytics provides far more data than this.</p><p>With the <a class=link href=https://wpmayor.com/link/monster-insights/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Pro version of the plugin</a>, you can view more in your WordPress dashboard. It also enables you to customize which data is visible so you can focus on the analytics that is most important to you. Licenses start at $99.50 per year.</p><h2 id=7-wp-rss-aggregatorhttpswpmayorcomlinkwprssaggregator>7. <a class=link href=https://wpmayor.com/link/wprssaggregator/ target=_blank rel=noopener>WP RSS Aggregator</a></h2><p><img src=https://wpmayor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/wp-rss-aggregator.png loading=lazy alt="The WP RSS Aggregator plugin."></p><p>Fresh content is vital to every blog, but coming up with post topics and writing articles is time-consuming. Especially if you’re balancing other responsibilities with managing your site, this can prove challenging. To help compensate, some incorporate <a class=link href=https://wpmayor.com/top-tips-for-effective-content-curation-strategies/ target=_blank rel=noopener>content curation</a> into their strategy.</p><p>If you think this may be a helpful solution for you, <a class=link href=https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-rss-aggregator/ target=_blank rel=noopener>WP RSS Aggregator</a> can help.
