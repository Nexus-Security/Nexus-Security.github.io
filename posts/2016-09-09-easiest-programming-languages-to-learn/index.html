There are so many different programming languages, and each has its own purpose. Sometimes even experts have to spend time carefully evaluating which to use for a particular task, so don’t feel like you’re alone!</p><p>With that said, if you’re interested in learning more about the 17 easiest coding languages, you’re in the right place!</p><h2 id=what-are-the-easiest-programming-languages-to-learn><strong>What are the Easiest Programming Languages to Learn?</strong></h2><p><a class=link href=https://careerkarma.com/blog/easiest-programming-languages-to-learn/software-engineering-infographic-instructions/ target=_blank rel=noopener><img src="https://744025.smushcdn.com/1245953/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/easiest-programming-languages-to-learn-1.jpg?lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1" loading=lazy alt="easiest programming languages to learn&ndash;17 easy coding languages infographic"></a></p><p>17 Easy Coding Languages</p><h3 id=1-html><strong>1. HTML</strong></h3><p><img src="https://744025.smushcdn.com/1245953/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/HTML-logo.png?lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1" loading=lazy alt="HTML logo"></p><p>HTML may not <em>technically</em> be a coding language, but it’s still important–and easy!</p><p>Ok, so <a class=link href=https://careerkarma.com/blog/is-html-easy-to-learn/ target=_blank rel=noopener>HTML</a> isn’t actually a programming language, but learning how to create an HTML page is often a person’s first step on their path to learning how to program.</p><p>You might recognize “HTML” as sometimes appearing as a part of a link to a website or in your browser’s address bar. It stands for Hypertext Markup Language. <a class=link href=https://careerkarma.com/blog/what-is-html-used-for/ target=_blank rel=noopener>HTML was originally designed</a> to help people format their text documents so they can be presented to readers in a cleaner way.</p><p>With HTML you build documents with building blocks named elements; for example, the element that contains the main content of an HTML page is named the “body” element, while inside the body element you often will see multiple “paragraph” elements represented by a “</p><p>” that indicate to the browser where each paragraph resides. </p><h3 id=2-css><strong>2. CSS</strong></h3><p><img src="https://744025.smushcdn.com/1245953/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/css-logo.png?lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1" loading=lazy alt="css logo"></p><p>CSS makes HTML pretty.</p><p><a class=link href=https://careerkarma.com/blog/beginners-guide-to-css/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</a> are most commonly used to define how a webpage should look when viewed by a browser; for example, you can set the text color or background color of certain elements with CSS.</p><p>However, you can also define animations and when they should be shown to the user, decide when to hide or show certain content, and precisely control the positioning of the elements of the page. Used properly, CSS can really improve the look, readability, and functionality of a website. </p><p>As an example of HTML and CSS, the article you’re reading right now is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p><h3 id=3-javascript><strong>3. JavaScript</strong></h3><p><img src="https://744025.smushcdn.com/1245953/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/javascript-logo.png?lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1" loading=lazy alt="javascript logo"></p><p>JavaScript makes HTML <em>function.</em></p><p><a class=link href=https://careerkarma.com/blog/how-to-code-in-javascript/ target=_blank rel=noopener>JavaScript (JS)</a> is commonly used in combination with HTML and CSS to implement client-side functionality through small “scripts”–that’s why it’s often referred to as a “scripting language.”</p><p>This functionality includes actions like showing more details when a user clicks on a certain button or enhancing a text field to show the user if her password satisfies certain security requirements.</p><p>But it also includes more complex behavior, like securely sending and retrieving information to another server. The use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript together in this way is often referred to as <a class=link href=https://careerkarma.com/blog/backend-vs-front-end-development/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Front end development</a>.</p><p>However, just because JavaScript is usually used to manipulate HTML elements or provide UI functionality like this doesn’t mean that’s all it’s capable of. It’s still powerful enough to accomplish tasks like implementing a search algorithm, analyzing data provided by a user, or solving mathematical equations. There are even game engines built with JavaScript that can have impressive results! </p><p>And JavaScript isn’t limited to implementing client-side functionality. Projects like <a class=link href=https://careerkarma.com/blog/how-to-debug-node/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Node.js</a> allow developers to create standard server-side functionality with JavaScript. So, a person who has a good understanding of this language can be effective on both the front end and back end sides of web development. </p><p>JavaScript shows us it’s important to keep in mind that just because a programming language is typically used in a certain way, it doesn’t mean it’s the only way it can be used. While the first thoughts of JavaScript for many people would be as a simple scripting language, there really isn’t any limit to what you can do with it or any programming language.</p><h3 id=4-python><strong>4.

Its syntax has many similarities with Java’s as well, so a programmer skilled in either of these languages shouldn’t have much difficulty transitioning between them.</p><p>I’d rate C# as having an “average” learning difficulty among the easiest programming languages here. While you do have to set up and run a compiler to build your programs, you likely won’t find any issues with reading and understanding the syntax for the typical program.</p><p>And given how large the C# community is, you should be able to easily find answers to any questions you have either by using a search engine or reviewing tutorials about the type of problem you are working on.</p><p>Perhaps one of the most recognizable projects making use of C# is the <a class=link href=https://unity.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Unity game engine</a>, which allows game developers to build a game that’s compatible with multiple platforms at once. If you’re especially interested in a game development career, you might want to consider starting with the <a class=link href=https://learn.unity.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>tutorials on Unity’s site</a> to both become familiar with C#’s syntax and pick up the essential concepts of making your own game.</p><h3 id=10-r><strong>10.

For example, developers planning an Operating System or an HTTP server will greatly benefit from these restrictions ensuring that the different processes that are executed only have access to the data and memory they’re supposed to. </p><p>One great demonstration of how Rust is used can be found in the Firefox browser itself. It was used to <a class=link href=https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/08/inside-a-super-fast-css-engine-quantum-css-aka-stylo/ target=_blank rel=noopener>improve the efficiency of the CSS engine</a> while simultaneously <a class=link href=https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/02/rewriting-a-browser-component-in-rust/ target=_blank rel=noopener>reducing the number of potential security vulnerabilities</a>.</p><p>Even though Rust is especially appropriate for dealing with this kind of system-level programming, it’s not unheard of for people to start their programming journey with Rust.

Functional programming emphasizes the use of mathematical functions to accomplish tasks, which usually ends up reducing the reliance on an external state or data and a program that is ultimately easier to debug and more likely to be executed safely alongside other processes.</p><p>This can be difficult to wrap your mind around if you’re still picking up the basics of programming, as it’s more common to start learning in an imperative style.
