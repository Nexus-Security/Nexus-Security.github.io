you can build a solid foundation in each before attending a <a class=link href=https://careerkarma.com/blog/preparing-for-a-coding-bootcamp/ target=_blank rel=noopener>coding bootcamp</a>.  </p><p>When you’re first starting out learning programming and choosing a programming language to start working in as a <a class=link href=https://careerkarma.com/blog/letter-to-newbies-learning-to-code/ target=_blank rel=noopener>code newbie</a>, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed. There are so many different programming languages, and each has its own purpose. Sometimes even experts have to spend time carefully evaluating which to use for a particular task, so don’t feel like you’re alone!</p><p>With that said, if you’re interested in learning more about the 17 easiest coding languages, you’re in the right place!</p><h2 id=what-are-the-easiest-programming-languages-to-learn><strong>What are the Easiest Programming Languages to Learn?</strong></h2><p><a class=link href=https://careerkarma.com/blog/easiest-programming-languages-to-learn/software-engineering-infographic-instructions/ target=_blank rel=noopener><img src="https://744025.smushcdn.com/1245953/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/easiest-programming-languages-to-learn-1.jpg?lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1" loading=lazy alt="easiest programming languages to learn&ndash;17 easy coding languages infographic"></a></p><p>17 Easy Coding Languages</p><h3 id=1-html><strong>1. HTML</strong></h3><p><img src="https://744025.smushcdn.com/1245953/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/HTML-logo.png?lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1" loading=lazy alt="HTML logo"></p><p>HTML may not <em>technically</em> be a coding language, but it’s still important–and easy!</p><p>Ok, so <a class=link href=https://careerkarma.com/blog/is-html-easy-to-learn/ target=_blank rel=noopener>HTML</a> isn’t actually a programming language, but learning how to create an HTML page is often a person’s first step on their path to learning how to program.</p><p>You might recognize “HTML” as sometimes appearing as a part of a link to a website or in your browser’s address bar. It stands for Hypertext Markup Language. <a class=link href=https://careerkarma.com/blog/what-is-html-used-for/ target=_blank rel=noopener>HTML was originally designed</a> to help people format their text documents so they can be presented to readers in a cleaner way.</p><p>With HTML you build documents with building blocks named elements; for example, the element that contains the main content of an HTML page is named the “body” element, while inside the body element you often will see multiple “paragraph” elements represented by a “</p><p>” that indicate to the browser where each paragraph resides. </p><h3 id=2-css><strong>2. CSS</strong></h3><p><img src="https://744025.smushcdn.com/1245953/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/css-logo.png?lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1" loading=lazy alt="css logo"></p><p>CSS makes HTML pretty.</p><p><a class=link href=https://careerkarma.com/blog/beginners-guide-to-css/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</a> are most commonly used to define how a webpage should look when viewed by a browser; for example, you can set the text color or background color of certain elements with CSS.</p><p>However, you can also define animations and when they should be shown to the user, decide when to hide or show certain content, and precisely control the positioning of the elements of the page. Used properly, CSS can really improve the look, readability, and functionality of a website. </p><p>As an example of HTML and CSS, the article you’re reading right now is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p><h3 id=3-javascript><strong>3. JavaScript</strong></h3><p><img src="https://744025.smushcdn.com/1245953/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/javascript-logo.png?lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1" loading=lazy alt="javascript logo"></p><p>JavaScript makes HTML <em>function.</em></p><p><a class=link href=https://careerkarma.com/blog/how-to-code-in-javascript/ target=_blank rel=noopener>JavaScript (JS)</a> is commonly used in combination with HTML and CSS to implement client-side functionality through small “scripts”–that’s why it’s often referred to as a “scripting language.”</p><p>This functionality includes actions like showing more details when a user clicks on a certain button or enhancing a text field to show the user if her password satisfies certain security requirements.</p><p>But it also includes more complex behavior, like securely sending and retrieving information to another server. The use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript together in this way is often referred to as <a class=link href=https://careerkarma.com/blog/backend-vs-front-end-development/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Front end development</a>.</p><p>However, just because JavaScript is usually used to manipulate HTML elements or provide UI functionality like this doesn’t mean that’s all it’s capable of. It’s still powerful enough to accomplish tasks like implementing a search algorithm, analyzing data provided by a user, or solving mathematical equations. There are even game engines built with JavaScript that can have impressive results! </p><p>And JavaScript isn’t limited to implementing client-side functionality. Projects like <a class=link href=https://careerkarma.com/blog/how-to-debug-node/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Node.js</a> allow developers to create standard server-side functionality with JavaScript. So, a person who has a good understanding of this language can be effective on both the front end and back end sides of web development. </p><p>JavaScript shows us it’s important to keep in mind that just because a programming language is typically used in a certain way, it doesn’t mean it’s the only way it can be used. While the first thoughts of JavaScript for many people would be as a simple scripting language, there really isn’t any limit to what you can do with it or any programming language.</p><h3 id=4-python><strong>4. Python</strong></h3><p><img src="https://744025.smushcdn.com/1245953/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/python-logo.png?lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1" loading=lazy alt="python logo"></p><p>Python is a highly readable general-purpose coding language.</p><p><a class=link href=https://careerkarma.com/blog/coding-in-python-for-beginners/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Python is an easy,</a> general-purpose coding language designed with readability in mind. As one of the easiest programming languages, it’s often used as an introductory language for college students beginning their Computer Science study.</p><p>Typical uses of Python include implementing back end functionality for websites through libraries like <a class=link href=https://careerkarma.com/blog/what-is-python-django/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Django</a>, analyzing data, and being used as a scripting language as a part of a larger program. Still, its popularity and longevity mean Python has been used for <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Python_software target=_blank rel=noopener>just about everything</a>.</p><p><a class=link href=https://careerkarma.com/blog/javascript-and-python/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Compared to JavaScript, Python</a> can just be a little more difficult to get started with Python only in that if you want to start creating your first program you’ll want to download and install a development environment on your computer.</p><h3 id=5-ruby><strong>5. Ruby</strong></h3><p><img src="https://744025.smushcdn.com/1245953/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Ruby_logo.png?lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1" loading=lazy alt="ruby logo"></p><p>One reason Ruby is an easy programming language is its supportive and friendly community.</p><p><a class=link href=https://careerkarma.com/blog/what-is-ruby-code-used-for/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Ruby</a> is a programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. The <a class=link href=https://careerkarma.com/blog/ruby-on-rails-vs-ruby/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Ruby on Rails</a> framework that makes it easy to use Ruby to create and provide web applications to users.</p><p><a class=link href=https://careerkarma.com/blog/python-or-ruby-easier-to-learn/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Ruby is often compared with Python</a>, as the two languages have common use cases, with Ruby similarly being a capable scripting language and able to be used for analyzing data. However, there’s increasingly a focus of Ruby being used more for web application development specifically.</p><p>Still, you can reasonably choose Ruby as your first programming language as it has a friendly community with many great, free resources for the beginning programmer.</p><p><a class=link href=https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/chap_00.html target=_blank rel=noopener><em>Learn to Program</em></a> is an online book that uses Ruby to teach you the basics of writing a program, or for a more whimsical, illustrated experience of learning the same concepts you can instead read <em><a class=link href=http://poignant.guide/book/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Why’s (Poignant) Guide to Rub</a></em><a class=link href=http://poignant.guide/book/ target=_blank rel=noopener>y</a>.</p><h3 id=6-java><strong>6.

As one of the easiest coding languages to learn, it’s commonly used to teach college students the basics of design patterns and software engineering.</p><p>Another general-purpose programming language, Java is one of the most popular for enterprise development, perhaps due to its straightforward nature, stability, and large community of developers.</p><p>As an example, one important project that makes use of Java is the Android Software Developer Kit (SDK), which allows developers to create applications that function on devices that use the Android Operating System. Additionally, we can point to Netflix as another example of Java’s power, <a class=link href=https://go.java/netflix.html target=_blank rel=noopener>as the language was used to build the foundation of Netflix’s streaming service</a>.</p><p>For someone just starting out with programming, it might feel a little overwhelming because, <a class=link href=https://careerkarma.com/blog/python-vs-java-web-development/ target=_blank rel=noopener>compared to Python, Java</a> is a bit more involved, while still requiring you to set up your own development environment. Still, once you get started working in Java, you shouldn’t run into too many surprises.</p><h3 id=7-php><strong>7. PHP</strong></h3><p><img src="https://744025.smushcdn.com/1245953/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/php-logo.png?lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1" loading=lazy alt="PHP logo"></p><p>PHP is one of the easiest coding languages…if you know HTML.</p><p><a class=link href=https://careerkarma.com/blog/everything-about-php/ target=_blank rel=noopener>PHP</a> stands for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor and is another general-purpose programming language. However, its actual use is largely to provide the back end server functionality essential to many important websites today.</p><p>PHP’s popularity might be attributed to how it makes it easy for developers to retrieve and store data in databases while also processing and replying to users’ requests. It’s also considered one of the easiest programming languages due to how seamlessly its responses can be presented to a user’s browser through HTML.</p><p>Some notable projects and services that use PHP <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP#Use target=_blank rel=noopener>include Facebook, Tumblr, and WordPress</a>. With these in mind, it’s easy to see how important and influential PHP has remained even with many newer languages trying to dislodge it from its place in <a class=link href=https://careerkarma.com/blog/backend-vs-front-end-development/ target=_blank rel=noopener>back end web development</a>.</p><p>As creating your first PHP program is as easy as embedding PHP code into an HTML page and uploading the file to a server that can process PHP, it’s very easy to get started with this language.</p><p>Laracast’s <a class=link href=https://laracasts.com/series/php-for-beginners target=_blank rel=noopener>“The PHP Practitioner”</a> video series is a fantastic free resource for people just starting with PHP to build a fundamental understanding of web development and basic programming concepts.</p><h3 id=8-cc><strong>8. C/C++</strong></h3><p><img src="https://744025.smushcdn.com/1245953/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/c-c-logo.png?size=241x151&lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1" loading=lazy alt="c/c++ logos"></p><p>C and C++ are perfect languages for building high-performance systems.</p><p><a class=link href=https://careerkarma.com/blog/how-are-c-varieties-different/ target=_blank rel=noopener>C and C++</a> are both very important lower-level programming languages that are especially useful in the context of creating systems that require a high level of performance.</p><p>C++ can be thought of as an extension to the C programming language, adding features like <a class=link href=https://careerkarma.com/blog/what-is-object-oriented-programming/ target=_blank rel=noopener>object-oriented programming</a>. Still, there are many similarities between C and C++, especially with regards to someone who is looking for an easy programming language to learn.</p><p>These languages are often referred to as being <a class=link href=https://careerkarma.com/blog/high-level-and-low-level-languages/ target=_blank rel=noopener>low-level languages</a> because they leave a lot of memory management to the programmer, as well as allowing you to make use of pointers to work with data structures to manipulate the information involved with your task.</p><p>While all programming languages require you to be exact with what you’re telling the computer to do, this is especially apparent in C or C++, where if you’re not careful you can accidentally access an incorrect portion of memory causing unexpected behavior.</p><p>Some important projects that make use of these languages include the <a class=link href=https://www.kernel.org/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Linux Kernel</a>, which is written in C, and Adobe’s Photoshop software which is in C++.</p><p>Someone skilled in these languages will be in high-demand and invaluable to an organization who creates programs with similar requirements where performance is very important. </p><p>For a person just starting out, languages like C and C++ can be intimidating because of the added complexity of the way you manage and interact with the memory used by your program. But at the same time, beginning your journey with one of these lower-level languages can really prepare you for understanding concepts and more nuanced topics.</p><h3 id=9-c><strong>9. C#</strong></h3><p><img src="https://744025.smushcdn.com/1245953/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/c-logo.png?lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1" loading=lazy alt="C# logo"></p><p>C# is an especially important coding language for game development.</p><p>C# is a general-purpose language developed by Microsoft and is especially suited for building programs for Windows environments and creating web applications in combination with the .NET Framework. </p><p>While C# offers support for many programming styles, it’s often used in an object-oriented way like Java. Its syntax has many similarities with Java’s as well, so a programmer skilled in either of these languages shouldn’t have much difficulty transitioning between them.</p><p>I’d rate C# as having an “average” learning difficulty among the easiest programming languages here. While you do have to set up and run a compiler to build your programs, you likely won’t find any issues with reading and understanding the syntax for the typical program.</p><p>And given how large the C# community is, you should be able to easily find answers to any questions you have either by using a search engine or reviewing tutorials about the type of problem you are working on.</p><p>Perhaps one of the most recognizable projects making use of C# is the <a class=link href=https://unity.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Unity game engine</a>, which allows game developers to build a game that’s compatible with multiple platforms at once.

Its goals were to simplify the syntax and general complexity of these and other languages to make it one of the easiest programming languages to learn. </p><p><img src="https://744025.smushcdn.com/1245953/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/gopher-go-mascot.png?lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1" loading=lazy alt="Gopher, the Go mascot"></p><p>This is Go’s mascot: Gopher.</p><p>Go is often used to implement components of larger projects where execution speed is important; for example, <a class=link href=https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2014/07/open-sourcing-our-go-libraries/ target=_blank rel=noopener>in 2014 Dropbox used Go</a> to improve the performance of its back end systems, especially with regard to accessing their database. </p><p>If Go sounds like the language for you, there’s a great, free book by Caleb Doxsey that will guide you through setting up your Go programming environment, show you how to compile your first Go program, and teach you essential programming concepts: <em><a class=link href=https://www.golang-book.com/books/intro target=_blank rel=noopener>An Introduction to Programming in Go</a></em><a class=link href=https://www.golang-book.com/books/intro target=_blank rel=noopener>.</a></p><h3 id=13-rust><strong>13.

For example, developers planning an Operating System or an HTTP server will greatly benefit from these restrictions ensuring that the different processes that are executed only have access to the data and memory they’re supposed to. </p><p>One great demonstration of how Rust is used can be found in the Firefox browser itself. It was used to <a class=link href=https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/08/inside-a-super-fast-css-engine-quantum-css-aka-stylo/ target=_blank rel=noopener>improve the efficiency of the CSS engine</a> while simultaneously <a class=link href=https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/02/rewriting-a-browser-component-in-rust/ target=_blank rel=noopener>reducing the number of potential security vulnerabilities</a>.</p><p>Even though Rust is especially appropriate for dealing with this kind of system-level programming, it’s not unheard of for people to start their programming journey with Rust. If the security focus of Rust sounds intriguing, you’ll want to either start with <a class=link href=https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/ target=_blank rel=noopener>“A Gentle Introduction to Rust”</a> or <a class=link href=https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch00-00-introduction.html target=_blank rel=noopener><em>The Rust Programming Language</em></a><em>.</em></p><h3 id=14-swift><strong>14.

It focuses on concurrent programming. This means its features and restrictions are ideal for building systems where multiple, distinct processes need to run simultaneously while still being able to easily communicate with each other.</p><p>Unlike many of the other programming languages mentioned on this list that have support for multiple programming styles, you can only program Erlang in a functional manner. Functional programming emphasizes the use of mathematical functions to accomplish tasks, which usually ends up reducing the reliance on an external state or data and a program that is ultimately easier to debug and more likely to be executed safely alongside other processes.</p><p>This can be difficult to wrap your mind around if you’re still picking up the basics of programming, as it’s more common to start learning in an imperative style. In comparison, a program in an imperative style makes it easy to access and modify external information that is shared throughout the program’s execution.</p><h3 id=15-elixir><strong>15.

An immutable data structure is one that cannot be directly modified after it’s created. While this might sound restrictive, having a guarantee like this means a function or program working with one of these structures doesn’t have to worry about the information they’re using changing unexpectedly. </p><p>Considering Clojure’s focus on being <a class=link href=https://clojure.org/community/success_stories target=_blank rel=noopener>useful for concurrency</a>, it’s not surprising that it’s often used for building services where this is important. Companies as large as <a class=link href=http://blog.cognitect.com/blog/2015/6/30/walmart-runs-clojure-at-scale target=_blank rel=noopener>Walmart use Clojure for back end services</a> to build systems that can easily handle large volumes of activity. </p><p>With Clojure being a functional programming language, starting with it as your first programming language carries the same caveats of possibly being difficult to understand for those not already familiar with the Computer Science concepts associated with writing and thinking in this way, especially with Clojure’s unique syntax.</p><p>However, if you already have some technical experience and are comfortable with working on the command line, <em><a class=link href=https://www.braveclojure.com/clojure-for-the-brave-and-true/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Clojure for the Brave and True</a></em> is a delightful book you can read for free to begin your journey of learning this language!</p><h2 id=so-whats-the-_easiest_-programming-language>So, What’s the <em>Easiest</em> Programming Language?</h2><p>In my opinion–and that of many others–<strong>JavaScript is the easiest programming language.</strong> You can start learning it with nothing more than your web browser and a text editor.</p><h2 id=what-about-the-rest-of-the-easiest-programming-languages>What About the Rest of the “Easiest Programming Languages”?</h2><p>In terms of overall complexity for someone just starting out with programming, you could argue for a ranking like the following, with 1 being the easiest:</p><ol><li><strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>, as they aren’t really programming languages but will get you comfortable with using a text editor and building documents according to well-defined rules.</li><li><strong>JavaScript and PHP</strong>, as they are perhaps the easiest programming languages of this list to get a tangible result you can play with when combined with HTML and CSS.</li><li><strong>Python, Ruby, Go, R, and Swift</strong>, as they’re straightforward, designed to be easy to learn, and have a simple syntax.</li><li><strong>Java and C#</strong>, as they’re of a medium complexity while also being well-established with many resources to answer any questions you’ll have.</li><li><strong>C and C++</strong>, as they’re at a low enough level where you’ll have to eventually be aware of how you manage your memory–in addition to learning basic programming concepts.</li><li><strong>Rust, Scala, Clojure, Erlang and Elixir</strong>, as they’re either functional-focused, which can be difficult to wrap your mind around, or complex enough to possibly be frustrating for beginners.</li></ol><p>However, it’s important to keep in mind that the ease-of-use isn’t the only thing you should consider. If you have specific goals of what kind of problems you want to solve or what kind of systems you want to build, you’ll want to review each programming language mentioned above and see which seems most appropriate.</p><p>A motivated person with some technical knowledge who knows they’re interested in building an Operating System could reasonably begin with Rust; it wouldn’t be an easy journey, but it wouldn’t be impossible, either. </p><p>In fact, the most important element for choosing a language is determining which provides you the most motivation to start learning and building your own creations, as that’s honestly the most difficult part. Everything else will eventually follow–as long as you keep working, creating your own projects, and learning all that you can about programming. </p><hr><p><strong>Even the easiest programming languages like those mentioned above can be challenging to learn.
