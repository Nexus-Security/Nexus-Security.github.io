href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_%28software%29#cite_note-4 target=_blank rel=noopener>[4]</a> Since 2016, there have been new releases of Delphi every six months, with new platforms being added approximately every second release.<a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_%28software%29#cite_note-5 target=_blank rel=noopener>[5]</a></p><p>Delphi includes a code editor, a visual designer, an integrated debugger, a <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control title="Version control" target=_blank rel=noopener>source code control</a> component, and support for third-party <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plugin_%28computing%29 title="Plugin (computing)" target=_blank rel=noopener>plugins</a>. The code editor features <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Insight title="Code Insight" target=_blank rel=noopener>Code Insight</a> (<a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_completion title="Code completion" target=_blank rel=noopener>code completion</a>), Error Insight (real-time error-checking), and <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring title="Code refactoring" target=_blank rel=noopener>refactoring</a>. The visual forms designer has traditionally used <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Component_Library title="Visual Component Library" target=_blank rel=noopener>Visual Component Library</a> (VCL) for native Windows development, but the <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FireMonkey title=FireMonkey target=_blank rel=noopener>FireMonkey</a> (FMX) platform was later added for cross-platform development. Database support in Delphi is very strong. A Delphi project of a million lines of code can compile in a few seconds – one benchmark[<em><a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid_weasel_words title="Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words" target=_blank rel=noopener>which?</a></em>] compiled 170,000 lines per second.</p><p>Delphi was originally developed by <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borland title=Borland target=_blank rel=noopener>Borland</a> as a <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_application_development title="Rapid application development" target=_blank rel=noopener>rapid application development</a> tool for Windows as the successor of <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal title="Turbo Pascal" target=_blank rel=noopener>Turbo Pascal</a>. Delphi added full <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming title="Object-oriented programming" target=_blank rel=noopener>object-oriented programming</a> to the existing language, and since then the language has grown to support generics and <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function title="Anonymous function" target=_blank rel=noopener>anonymous methods</a>, and native <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_Object_Model title="Component Object Model" target=_blank rel=noopener>Component Object Model</a> (COM) support. In 2006, Borland’s developer tools section was transferred from Borland to a wholly owned subsidiary known as <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CodeGear title=CodeGear target=_blank rel=noopener>CodeGear</a>, which was sold to <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarcadero_Technologies title="Embarcadero Technologies" target=_blank rel=noopener>Embarcadero Technologies</a> in 2008. In 2015, Embarcadero was purchased by <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idera_Software title="Idera Software" target=_blank rel=noopener>Idera Software</a>, but the Embarcadero mark was retained for the developer tools division.</p><p>Delphi and its <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B title=C++ target=_blank rel=noopener>C++</a> counterpart, <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2BBuilder title=C++Builder target=_blank rel=noopener>C++Builder</a>, are interoperable. They share many core components, notably the IDE, VCL, and much of the <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_library title="Runtime library" target=_blank rel=noopener>runtime library</a>. In addition, they can be used jointly in a project. For example, C++Builder 6 and later can consume Delphi source code and C++ in one project, while packages compiled with C++Builder can be used from within Delphi. In 2007, the products were released jointly as <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_%28software%29#RAD_Studio target=_blank rel=noopener>RAD Studio</a>, a shared host for Delphi and C++Builder, which can be purchased with either or both.</p><h2 id=features>Features</h2><p>Delphi supports <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_application_development title="Rapid application development" target=_blank rel=noopener>rapid application development</a> (RAD). Among the features supporting RAD are the <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_framework title="Application framework" target=_blank rel=noopener>application framework</a> and the visual designer.[<em><a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed title="Wikipedia:Citation needed" target=_blank rel=noopener>citation needed</a></em>] Delphi uses the <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_programming_language title="Pascal programming language" target=_blank rel=noopener>Pascal</a>-based programming language called <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Pascal title="Object Pascal" target=_blank rel=noopener>Object Pascal</a> introduced by Borland. It supports native <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-compilation title=Cross-compilation target=_blank rel=noopener>cross-compilation</a>. Its visual designer has traditionally used <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Component_Library title="Visual Component Library" target=_blank rel=noopener>Visual Component Library</a> (VCL) for RAD.</p><p>To better support development for Microsoft Windows and interoperate with code developed with other software development tools, Delphi supports independent interfaces of <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_Object_Model title="Component Object Model" target=_blank rel=noopener>Component Object Model</a> (COM) with <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_counting title="Reference counting" target=_blank rel=noopener>reference counted</a> class implementations, and support for many third-party components. <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_%28computer_science%29 title="Interface (computer science)" target=_blank rel=noopener>Interface</a> implementations can be delegated to fields or properties of classes. Message handlers are implemented by tagging a method of a class with the integer constant of the message to handle.</p><p><a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database title=Database target=_blank rel=noopener>Database</a> connectivity is extensively supported through the many VCL database-aware and database access components.</p><p>Later versions have included upgraded and enhanced runtime library routines provided by the community group <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FastCode title=FastCode target=_blank rel=noopener>FastCode</a>, established in 2003.</p><h3 id=characteristics>Characteristics</h3><p>Delphi is a <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly-typed_programming_language title="Strongly-typed programming language" target=_blank rel=noopener>strongly typed</a> <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language title="High-level programming language" target=_blank rel=noopener>high-level programming language</a>, intended to be easy to use and originally based on the earlier Object Pascal language. <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_%28programming_language%29 title="Pascal (programming language)" target=_blank rel=noopener>Pascal</a> was originally developed as a general-purpose language &ldquo;suitable for expressing the fundamental constructs known at the time in a concise and logical way&rdquo;, and &ldquo;its implementation was to be efficient and competitive with existing FORTRAN compilers&rdquo;<a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_%28software%29#cite_note-6 target=_blank rel=noopener>[6]</a> but without low-level programming facilities or access to hardware. Turbo Pascal and its descendants, including Delphi, support access to hardware and low-level programming, with the facility to incorporate code written in <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language title="Assembly language" target=_blank rel=noopener>assembly language</a> and other languages. Delphi&rsquo;s <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming title="Object-oriented programming" target=_blank rel=noopener>object orientation</a> features only class- and interface-based <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_in_object-oriented_programming title="Polymorphism in object-oriented programming" target=_blank rel=noopener>polymorphism</a>.<a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_%28software%29#cite_note-WangTan2006-7 target=_blank rel=noopener>[7]</a> Metaclasses are first class objects. Objects are actually references to the objects (as in <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29 title="Java (programming language)" target=_blank rel=noopener>Java</a>), which Delphi implicitly de-references, so there is usually no need to manually allocate memory for pointers to objects or use similar techniques that some other languages need. There are dedicated reference-counted string types, and also null-terminated strings.</p><p>Strings can be concatenated by using the &lsquo;+&rsquo; operator, rather than using functions. For dedicated string types Delphi handles memory management without programmer intervention. Since Borland Developer Studio 2006 there are functions to locate <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_leak title="Memory leak" target=_blank rel=noopener>memory leaks</a>.</p><p>Delphi includes an integrated IDE. The Delphi products all ship with a <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Component_Library title="Visual Component Library" target=_blank rel=noopener>Visual Component Library</a> (VCL), including most of its source code. Third-party components (sometimes with full <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code title="Source code" target=_blank rel=noopener>source code</a>) and tools to enhance the IDE or for other Delphi related development tasks are available, some free of charge. The IDE includes a GUI for localization and translation of created programs that may be deployed to a translator; there are also third-party tools with more features for this purpose. The VCL framework maintains a high level of source compatibility between versions, which simplifies updating existing source code to a newer Delphi version. Third-party libraries may need updates from the vendor but, if source code is supplied, recompilation with the newer version may be sufficient. The VCL was an early adopter of <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection title="Dependency injection" target=_blank rel=noopener>dependency injection</a> or <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_Control title="Inversion of Control" target=_blank rel=noopener>inversion of control</a>; it uses a-&ldquo;re-usable&rdquo; component model, extensible by the developer. With class helpers new functionality can be introduced to core RTL and VCL classes without changing the original source code of the RTL or VCL.</p><p>The compiler is optimizing and single pass. It can optionally compile to a single <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable title=Executable target=_blank rel=noopener>executable</a> which does not require <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic-link_library title="Dynamic-link library" target=_blank rel=noopener>DLLs</a>. Delphi can also generate standard DLLs, <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActiveX title=ActiveX target=_blank rel=noopener>ActiveX</a> DLLs, <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_Object_Model title="Component Object Model" target=_blank rel=noopener>COM</a> automation servers and Windows services.</p><p>The Delphi IDEs since Delphi 2005 increasingly support <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refactoring title=Refactoring target=_blank rel=noopener>refactoring</a> features such as method extraction and the possibility to create <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language title="Unified Modeling Language" target=_blank rel=noopener>UML</a> models from the source code or to modify the source through changes made in the model.</p><p>Delphi has large communities on <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet title=Usenet target=_blank rel=noopener>Usenet</a> and the <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web title="World Wide Web" target=_blank rel=noopener>web</a>. When Delphi was owned by Codegear, many of its employees actively participated.</p><h3 id=backward-compatibility>Backward compatibility</h3><p>Each new release of Delphi attempts to be as compatible as possible with earlier versions, so that already-developed software and libraries can be retained. Incompatibility necessarily arises as new functionality is added.</p><h3 id=limitations>Limitations</h3><p>Although each new release of Delphi attempts to keep as much backwards compatibility as possible to allow existing code reuse, new features, new libraries, and improvements sometimes make newer releases less than 100% backwards compatible. For example, the design of the standard class libraries (VCL/RTL) had become somewhat dated and restrictive; Embarcadero released in 2011 as part of Delphi XE2 a new compiler and cross-platform VCL replacement called FireMonkey, based on Direct3D and OpenGL, which runs on other platforms in addition to Windows, supporting their features, but is not fully backwards-compatible with VCL applications. FireMonkey applications do however allow easy sharing of non visual code <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_%28Software_Development%29 title="Unit (Software Development)" target=_blank rel=noopener>units</a> with VCL applications, enabling a lot of code to be ported easily between the platforms.</p><p>Some releases of Delphi have been reported to be unstable.

Borland developer <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Thorpe title="Danny Thorpe" target=_blank rel=noopener>Danny Thorpe</a> suggested the <em>Delphi</em> codename in reference to the <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_at_Delphi title="Oracle at Delphi" target=_blank rel=noopener>Oracle at Delphi</a>. One of the design goals of the product was to provide database connectivity to programmers as a key feature and a popular database package at the time was <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_database title="Oracle database" target=_blank rel=noopener>Oracle database</a>; hence, &ldquo;If you want to talk to [the] Oracle, go to Delphi&rdquo;.</p><p>As development continued towards the first release, the Delphi codename gained popularity among the development team and beta testing group. However, the Borland marketing leadership preferred a functional product name over an iconic name and made preparations to release the product under the name &ldquo;Borland AppBuilder&rdquo;.</p><p>Shortly before the release of the Borland product, Novell AppBuilder was released, leaving Borland in need of a new product name. After much debate and many market research surveys, the Delphi codename became the Delphi product name.<a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_%28software%29#cite_note-8 target=_blank rel=noopener>[8]</a></p><p>The chief architect behind Delphi was <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Hejlsberg title="Anders Hejlsberg" target=_blank rel=noopener>Anders Hejlsberg</a>, who had developed <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal title="Turbo Pascal" target=_blank rel=noopener>Turbo Pascal</a>. He was persuaded to move to <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft title=Microsoft target=_blank rel=noopener>Microsoft</a> in 1996.</p><p>On February 8, 2006 Borland announced that it was looking for a buyer for its IDE and database line of products, including Delphi, to concentrate on its <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_Lifecycle_Management title="Application Lifecycle Management" target=_blank rel=noopener>ALM</a> line. On November 14, 2006 Borland transferred the development tools group to an independent subsidiary company named <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CodeGear title=CodeGear target=_blank rel=noopener>CodeGear</a>, instead of selling it. Borland subsequently sold CodeGear to <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarcadero_Technologies title="Embarcadero Technologies" target=_blank rel=noopener>Embarcadero Technologies</a> in 2008. Embarcadero retained the CodeGear division created by Borland to identify its tool and database offerings, but identified its own database tools under the DatabaseGear name. In 2015, Embarcadero was purchased by <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idera_Software title="Idera Software" target=_blank rel=noopener>Idera Software</a>, but the Embarcadero mark was retained for the developer tools division.</p><h3 id=early-borland-years-19952003>Early Borland years (1995–2003)</h3><p>Borland Delphi</p><p>Delphi (later known as Delphi 1) was released in 1995 for the 16-bit <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.1 title="Windows 3.1" target=_blank rel=noopener>Windows 3.1</a>, and was an early example of what became known as <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_Application_Development title="Rapid Application Development" target=_blank rel=noopener>Rapid Application Development</a> (RAD) tools. Delphi evolved from Borland&rsquo;s &ldquo;Turbo Pascal for Windows&rdquo;, itself an evolution with Windows support from Borland&rsquo;s Turbo Pascal and Borland Pascal with Objects, very fast 16-bit native-code MS-DOS compilers with their own sophisticated <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment title="Integrated development environment" target=_blank rel=noopener>integrated development environment</a> (IDE) and <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_user_interface title="Text user interface" target=_blank rel=noopener>textual user interface</a> toolkit for <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS title=DOS target=_blank rel=noopener>DOS</a> (<a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Vision title="Turbo Vision" target=_blank rel=noopener>Turbo Vision</a>). Early Turbo Pascal (for MS-DOS) was written in a dialect of the <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_%28programming_language%29 title="Pascal (programming language)" target=_blank rel=noopener>Pascal programming language</a>; in later versions support for <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_%28computer_science%29 title="Object (computer science)" target=_blank rel=noopener>objects</a> was added, and it was named <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Pascal title="Object Pascal" target=_blank rel=noopener>Object Pascal</a>. Delphi has always used Object Pascal, which continued to be developed, as its underlying <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_language title="Object-oriented language" target=_blank rel=noopener>object-oriented language</a>.</p><p>Borland Delphi 2</p><p>Delphi 2, released in 1996, supported 32-bit Windows environments. Delphi 1 was bundled with it for creation of 16-bit Windows 3.1 applications. New <a class=link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quickreport&action=edit&redlink=1" title="Quickreport (page does not exist)" target=_blank rel=noopener>Quickreport</a> components replacing Borland ReportSmith.</p><p>Borland Delphi 3</p><p>Delphi 3, released in 1997, added new VCL components encapsulating the 4.71 version of Windows Common Controls (such as Rebar and Toolbar), TDataset architecture separated from BDE, DLL debugging, the code insight technology, component packages, component templates, DecisionCube and <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teechart title=Teechart target=_blank rel=noopener>Teechart</a> components for statistical graphing, <a class=link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=WebBroker&action=edit&redlink=1" title="WebBroker (page does not exist)" target=_blank rel=noopener>WebBroker</a>, ActiveForms, <a class=link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=DataSnap&action=edit&redlink=1" title="DataSnap (page does not exist)" target=_blank rel=noopener>MIDAS three tier architecture</a>, component packages and integration with <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_Object_Model title="Component Object Model" target=_blank rel=noopener>COM</a> through interfaces.</p><p>Inprise Delphi 4</p><p>Inprise Delphi 4 was released in 1998. IDE came with a completely overhauled editor and became dockable. VCL added support for ActionLists anchors and constraints. Additional improvements were method overloading, dynamic arrays, Windows 98 support, <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28software_platform%29 title="Java (software platform)" target=_blank rel=noopener>Java</a> interoperability, high performance database drivers, <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CORBA title=CORBA target=_blank rel=noopener>CORBA</a> development, and Microsoft <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BackOffice title=BackOffice target=_blank rel=noopener>BackOffice</a> support. It was the last version shipped with Delphi 1 for 16 bit programming.</p><p>Borland Delphi 5</p><p>Borland Delphi 5 was released in 1999. Added concept of frames, parallel development, translation capabilities, enhanced integrated debugger, <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML title=XML target=_blank rel=noopener>XML</a> support, <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADO.NET title=ADO.NET target=_blank rel=noopener>ADO</a> database support and <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_counting title="Reference counting" target=_blank rel=noopener>reference counting</a> <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_%28object-oriented_programming%29 title="Protocol (object-oriented programming)" target=_blank rel=noopener>interfaces</a></p><p>Borland Delphi 6</p><p>Attempts to support both Linux and Windows for cross-platform development were made, and a cross-platform alternative to the <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Component_Library title="Visual Component Library" target=_blank rel=noopener>VCL</a> known as CLX shipped in 2001 with the release of Delphi 6. This was the second product in Borland&rsquo;s series of Linux-compatible native developer tools, establishing code-compatible IDEs for both Linux (see Kylix above) and Windows (Delphi 6) using the shared CLX component framework for both. Later efforts would include CLX in C++Builder 6 and add C++ code-compatibility to the RAD tools line. Delphi 6 included the same CLX version (CLX 1) as the first version of Kylix. CLX 1 had been created before Delphi 6; its feature set was based on VCL 5 and lacked some features added to the VCL 6 shipped with Delphi 6.<a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_%28software%29#cite_note-9 target=_blank rel=noopener>[9]</a></p><p>Borland Delphi 7</p><p>Delphi 7, released in August 2002, became the standard version used by more Delphi developers than any other single version. It is one of the most successful IDEs created by Borland because of its stability, speed and low hardware requirements, and remains in active use as of 2017. Delphi 7 added support for Windows XP Themes, and added more support for building Web applications. It was the last version of Delphi that did not require mandatory <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_activation title="Software activation" target=_blank rel=noopener>software activation</a>.</p><h3 id=later-borland-years-20032008>Later Borland years (2003–2008)</h3><p>Borland Delphi 8</p><p>Delphi 8 (Borland Developer Studio 2.0), released December 2003, was a <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_.NET title="Microsoft .NET" target=_blank rel=noopener>.NET</a>-only release that compiled Delphi Object Pascal code into .NET <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Intermediate_Language title="Common Intermediate Language" target=_blank rel=noopener>CIL</a>; the IDE was rewritten for this purpose. The IDE changed to a docked interface (called <em>Galileo</em>) similar to Microsoft&rsquo;s Visual Studio.NET. Delphi 8 was highly criticized[<em><a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch" target=_blank rel=noopener>by whom?</a></em>] for its low quality and its inability to create native applications (Win32 API/x86 code). The inability to generate native applications is only applicable to this release; the capability would be restored in the next release.</p><p>Borland Delphi 2005</p><p>The next version, Delphi 2005 (Delphi 9, also Borland Developer Studio 3.0), included the Win32 and .NET development in a single IDE, reiterating Borland&rsquo;s commitment to Win32 developers. Delphi 2005 includes design-time manipulation of live data from a database. It also includes an improved IDE and added a <em>for &mldr; in</em> statement (like C#&rsquo;s <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreach title=Foreach target=_blank rel=noopener>foreach</a>) to the language. However, it was widely criticized<a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_%28software%29#cite_note-10 target=_blank rel=noopener>[10]</a> for its bugs; both Delphi 8 and Delphi 2005 had stability problems when shipped, which were only partially resolved in service packs. The ability to compile native windows applications (*.exe) was added back into Delphi 2005 after being removed in Delphi 8. CLX support was dropped for new applications from this release onwards.</p><p>Borland Delphi 2006</p><p>In late 2005 Delphi 2006 (Delphi 10, also Borland Developer Studio 4.0) was released combining development of C# and Delphi.NET, Delphi Win32 and C++ (Preview when it was shipped but stabilized in Update 1) into a single IDE. It was much more stable than Delphi 8 or Delphi 2005 when shipped, and improved further with the release of two updates and several hotfixes.</p><p>Turbo Delphi and Turbo Delphi for .NET</p><p>On September 6, 2006 The Developer Tools Group (the working name of the not yet spun off company) of Borland Software Corporation released single-language editions of Borland Developer Studio 2006, bringing back the <em>Turbo</em> name. The Turbo product set included Turbo Delphi for Win32, Turbo Delphi for .NET, Turbo C++, and Turbo C#. There were two variants of each edition: <em>Explorer</em>, a free downloadable flavor, and a <em>Professional</em> flavor, priced at US$899 for new users and US$399 for upgrades, which opened access to thousands of third-party components. Unlike earlier <em>Personal</em> editions of Delphi, <em>Explorer</em> editions could be used for commercial development.</p><p>Codegear Delphi 2007</p><p>Delphi 2007 (Delphi 11), the first version by CodeGear, was released on March 16, 2007. The Win32 personality was released first, before the .NET personality of Delphi 2007 based on .NET Framework 2.0 was released as part of the CodeGear RAD Studio 2007 product. New features included support for <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSBuild title=MSBuild target=_blank rel=noopener>MSBuild</a> and enhancements to the VCL for Windows Vista, but the C#Builder feature was dropped in this release as sales were not as high as expected due to Visual Studio also offering C#. The Windows Form designer for Delphi .NET was also dropped in 2007 because it is based on part of the .NET framework API, which Microsoft had changed so drastically in .NET 2.0 that updating the IDE would have been a major undertaking. Delphi 2007 also introduced DBX4 as the next version of dbExpress. For the first time Delphi could be downloaded from the Internet and activated with a license key. Internationalized versions of Delphi 2007 shipped simultaneously in English, French, German and Japanese. RAD Studio 2007 (code named Highlander), which includes .NET and C++Builder development, was released on September 5, 2007.</p><p>Delphi for PHP</p><p>In CodeGear era emerged an IDE targeting <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP title=PHP target=_blank rel=noopener>PHP</a> development despite the word &ldquo;Delphi&rdquo; in its name. That one is Delphi for PHP whose highlight is a VCL-like PHP framework which enables for PHP the same Rapid Application Development methodology as in ASP.NET Web Form. Version 1.0 and 2.0 were released in March 2007 and April 2008 respectively. The IDE would later evolve into <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RadPHP title=RadPHP target=_blank rel=noopener>RadPHP</a> after CodeGear&rsquo;s acquisition by Embarcadero.</p><h3 id=embarcadero-years-2008>Embarcadero years (2008–)</h3><p>Codegear Delphi 2009</p><p>Delphi 2009 (Delphi 12, code named Tiburón), added many new features such as completely reworking the <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Component_Library title="Visual Component Library" target=_blank rel=noopener>VCL</a> and RTL for full Unicode support, and added generics and <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function title="Anonymous function" target=_blank rel=noopener>anonymous methods</a> for Win32 native development. Support for .NET development was dropped from the mainstream Delphi IDE starting with this version, and was catered for by the new Delphi Prism 2009 (Version 1.0).<a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_%28software%29#cite_note-11 target=_blank rel=noopener>[11]</a></p><p>Delphi Prism was developed by <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RemObjects_Software title="RemObjects Software" target=_blank rel=noopener>RemObjects Software</a> and distributed by Embarcadero from 2008 to replace Delphi.NET. It is a combination of RemObjects&rsquo;s mostly Delphi-compatible .NET compiler (without RTL or <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Component_Library title="Visual Component Library" target=_blank rel=noopener>VCL</a>), a version of the Microsoft Visual Studio Shell without C# or VB support, and some Embarcadero technologies such as dbExpress. Prism is cross-platform capable insofar as it supports the Mono .NET libraries.</p><p>Codegear Delphi 2010</p><p>Delphi 2010 (code-named Weaver, aka Delphi 14; there was no version 13), was released on August 25, 2009 and is the second Unicode release of Delphi. It includes a new compiler <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-time_type_information title="Run-time type information" target=_blank rel=noopener>run-time type information</a> (RTTI) system, support for Windows 7 <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct2D title=Direct2D target=_blank rel=noopener>Direct2D</a>, touch screen and gestures, a source code formatter, debugger visualizers and the option to also have the old style component palette in the IDE. The new RTTI system makes larger executables than previous versions. Delphi Prism 2010 (Version 3.0) which is the last Visual Studio 2008 only based one was also released in August 2009.</p><p>Embarcadero Delphi XE</p><p>Delphi XE (aka Delphi 2011,<a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_%28software%29#cite_note-12 target=_blank rel=noopener>[12]</a> code named Fulcrum), was released on August 30, 2010 with Delphi support for Amazon EC2, Microsoft Azure were bundled. Delphi Prism XE (Version 4.0) which is the first Visual Studio 2010 based one (However, it can also integrated into Visual Studio 2008) was also released in August 2010. It is essentially a rebranded Delphi Prism 2011 (also Version 4.0) which was released three months earlier. RadPHP had been incorporated in to RAD Studio since RadPHP XE (Version 3.0) that was evolved from the formal Delphi for PHP product developed by CodeGear in its Borland days.</p><p>Delphi Starter Edition</p><p>On January 27, 2011 Embarcadero announced the availability of a new Starter Edition that gives independent developers, students and micro businesses a slightly reduced feature set<a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_%28software%29#cite_note-13 target=_blank rel=noopener>[13]</a> for a price less than a quarter of that of the next-cheapest version.

Delphi XE2 natively supports <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X64 title=X64 target=_blank rel=noopener>64-bit</a> Windows (except the starter edition), in addition to the long-supported 32-bit versions, with some backwards compatibility. Applications for 64-bit platforms can be compiled, but not tested or run, on the 32-bit platform. The XE2 IDE cannot debug 64-bit programs on Windows 8 and above. Delphi XE2 is supplied with both the VCL, and an alternative library called <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FireMonkey title=FireMonkey target=_blank rel=noopener>FireMonkey</a> that supports Windows, <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X title="Mac OS X" target=_blank rel=noopener>Mac OS X</a> and the Apple <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone title=IPhone target=_blank rel=noopener>iPhone</a>, <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Touch title="IPod Touch" target=_blank rel=noopener>iPod Touch</a> and <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad title=IPad target=_blank rel=noopener>iPad</a> portable devices. FireMonkey and VCL are not compatible; one or the other must be used, and older VCL applications cannot use Firemonkey unless user interfaces are recreated with FireMonkey <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_%28programming%29 title="Form (programming)" target=_blank rel=noopener>forms</a> and <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUI_widget title="GUI widget" target=_blank rel=noopener>controls</a>. Third parties have published information on how to use Firemonkey forms in VCL software, to facilitate gradual migration, but even then VCL and Firemonkey controls cannot be used on the same form.<a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_%28software%29#cite_note-14 target=_blank rel=noopener>[14]</a> Embarcadero says that <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux title=Linux target=_blank rel=noopener>Linux</a> <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system title="Operating system" target=_blank rel=noopener>operating system</a> support &ldquo;is being considered for the roadmap&rdquo;, as is <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_%28operating_system%29 title="Android (operating system)" target=_blank rel=noopener>Android</a>, and that they are &ldquo;committed to &mldr; FireMonkey. &mldr; expect regular and frequent updates to FireMonkey&rdquo;. Pre-2013 versions only supported iOS platform development with Xcode 4.2.1 and lower, OS X version 10.7 and lower, and iOS SDK 4.3 and earlier.</p><p>Embarcadero Delphi XE3</p><p>On September 4, 2012 Embarcadero released RAD Studio XE3, which included Delphi XE3, C++Builder, Embarcadero Prism XE3 (Version 5.2) and HTML5 Builder XE3 (Version 5.0) which was upgraded and rebranded from RadPHP. Delphi XE3 natively supports both 32-bit and <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X64 title=X64 target=_blank rel=noopener>64-bit</a> editions of Windows (including Windows 8), and provides support for <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X title="Mac OS X" target=_blank rel=noopener>Mac OS X</a> with the Firemonkey 2/FM² framework. <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS title=IOS target=_blank rel=noopener>iOS</a> support was dropped with XE3 release initially (with intent to add support back in with a separate product – Mobile Studio), but applications can continue to be targeted to that platform by developing with Delphi XE2.</p><p>Embarcadero Delphi XE4</p><p>On April 22, 2013 Embarcadero released RAD Studio XE4, which included Delphi XE4, and C++Builder. There has been no major upgrade for either Embarcadero Prism or HTML5 Builder thence. Delphi XE4 is the first release of the <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FireMonkey title=FireMonkey target=_blank rel=noopener>FireMonkey</a> mobile platform, featuring cross-platform mobile application development for the <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS title=IOS target=_blank rel=noopener>iOS</a> Simulator and <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS title=IOS target=_blank rel=noopener>iOS</a> Devices. In this version Embarcadero introduces two new compilers for Delphi mobile applications, the Delphi Cross Compiler for the iOS Simulator and the Delphi Cross Compiler for the iOS Devices. These compilers significantly differ from the Win64 desktop compiler as they do not support <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_Object_Model title="Component Object Model" target=_blank rel=noopener>COM</a>, inline assembly of CPU instructions, and six older string types such as PChar. The new mobile compilers advance the notion of eliminating pointers. The new compilers require an explicit style of marshalling data to and from external APIs and libraries. Delphi XE4 Run-Time Library (RTL) is optimized for 0-based, read-only (immutable) Unicode strings, that cannot be indexed for the purpose of changing their individual characters. The RTL also adds status-bit based exception routines for ARM CPUs that do not generate exception interrupts.</p><p>Embarcadero Delphi XE5</p><p>On September 12, 2013 Embarcadero released RAD Studio XE5, which includes Delphi XE5 and C++Builder. It adds support for Android (specifically: ARM v7 devices running Gingerbread (2.3.3–2.3.7), Ice Cream Sandwich (4.0.3–4.0.4) and Jelly Bean (4.1.x, 4.2.x, 4.3.x)) and iOS 7.</p><p>Embarcadero Delphi XE6</p><p>On April 15, 2014 Embarcadero released RAD Studio XE6, which included Delphi XE6 and C++Builder. It allows to create natively-compiled apps for all platforms for, desktop, mobile, and wearable devices like Google Glass, with a single C++ or Object Pascal (Delphi) codebase. RAD Studio XE6 adds support for Android 4.4 KitKat.

Versions 10.3.1, 10.3.2, and 10.3.3 (November 21, 2019) were also released.</p><h2 id=roadmaps>Roadmaps</h2><p>Embarcadero publishes &ldquo;roadmaps&rdquo; describing their future development plans. The most recent one was published in May 2019.<a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_%28software%29#cite_note-15 target=_blank rel=noopener>[15]</a>, which was amended in August 2019 <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_%28software%29#cite_note-16 target=_blank rel=noopener>[16]</a></p><h2 id=related-software>Related software</h2><ul><li>Borland Enterprise Studio, a precursor to RAD Studio, is a software development suite that includes support for multiple languages. Borland Enterprise Studio for Windows supports Delphi.<a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_%28software%29#cite_note-17 target=_blank rel=noopener>[17]</a></li><li><a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borland_Kylix title="Borland Kylix" target=_blank rel=noopener>Borland Kylix</a>: Similar to Borland Enterprise Studio, but only supports C++ and Delphi, but for Linux. To get a product out quickly and cheaply, they made the IDE depend on the <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine_%28software%29 title="Wine (software)" target=_blank rel=noopener>Wine</a> libraries rather than Linux&rsquo;s native system libraries (glibc). The expense of developing a native glibc version of Kylix, combined with the lack of Linux adoption among programmers at the time, made sales go soft, and Kylix was abandoned after version 3. This was the first attempt to add Linux support in the Delphi product family.[<em><a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed title="Wikipedia:Citation needed" target=_blank rel=noopener>citation needed</a></em>] Kylix used the new CLX cross-platform framework, instead of Delphi&rsquo;s VCL.</li><li><a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAD_Studio title="RAD Studio" target=_blank rel=noopener>RAD Studio</a>: a development of tool suite by Borland Software Corporation (later Embarcadero), consists of Delphi, <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2BBuilder title=C++Builder target=_blank rel=noopener>C++Builder</a>, Embarcadero Prism, and HTML5 Builder. Like Delphi, there are different editions of RAD Studio: Professional edition, Enterprise edition, Ultimate edition and Architect edition.</li><li><a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterBase title=InterBase target=_blank rel=noopener>InterBase</a> integrates natively to Delphi and C++Builder for client/server or embedded development and can be accessed by all major languages and platforms in the market with database connection protocols like ODBC, ADO, ADO.NET and even with Java by JDBC/ODBC Bridge or Java type 4 connectors.</li><li><a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JBuilder title=JBuilder target=_blank rel=noopener>JBuilder</a> is a tool for Java development based on Eclipse since version JBuilder 2007.</li><li><a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RadPHP title=RadPHP target=_blank rel=noopener>RadPHP</a> (now superseded by HTML5 Builder) was an <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment title="Integrated development environment" target=_blank rel=noopener>IDE</a> for <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP title=PHP target=_blank rel=noopener>PHP</a> that provides true RAD functionality. It has a form designer similar to that of Delphi or <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic title="Visual Basic" target=_blank rel=noopener>Visual Basic</a>, and an integrated debugger based on the <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server title="Apache HTTP Server" target=_blank rel=noopener>Apache</a> web server. It also includes a <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Component_Library title="Visual Component Library" target=_blank rel=noopener>VCL</a> library ported to PHP. Unlike other IDEs it supports Web 2.0 features such as <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX title=AJAX target=_blank rel=noopener>AJAX</a>. Delphi for PHP was announced on March 20, 2007, renamed on October 2010 to RadPHP, and is based on Qadram Q studio. Embarcadero acquired Qadram in January 2011.</li><li>Delphi Prism (later known as Embarcadero Prism) derived from the <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygene_%28programming_language%29 title="Oxygene (programming language)" target=_blank rel=noopener>Oxygene programming language</a> (previously known as Chrome) from RemObjects. It ran in the Microsoft Visual Studio IDE rather than RAD Studio. It was licensed and re-branded by Embarcadero to replace Delphi.NET when that product was discontinued. Although RemObjects Oxygene was further developed and incorporated support for native Java, Android, iOS and OS X development, the version licensed by Embarcadero was limited to only supporting .NET. It was eventually discontinued by Embarcadero with the release of Delphi XE4, leaving the Delphi product line with no support for .NET development. The Oxygene product it was based on continues to be developed by RemObjects as part of their Elements product line.</li><li><a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Pascal title="Free Pascal" target=_blank rel=noopener>Free Pascal</a> is an open-source Pascal <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-platform title=Cross-platform target=_blank rel=noopener>cross-platform</a> <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-compiler title=Cross-compiler target=_blank rel=noopener>cross-compiler</a> that supports most of Delphi&rsquo;s Object Pascal code. Free Pascal also has its own language extensions, multiple compiler [language syntax] modes, and supports 18+ operating systems and 9+ processor architectures.<a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_%28software%29#cite_note-18 target=_blank rel=noopener>[18]</a><a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazarus_%28IDE%29 title="Lazarus (IDE)" target=_blank rel=noopener>Lazarus</a> is a cross-platform RAD IDE that uses the Free Pascal compiler. Lazarus and Free Pascal – free software independent of Embarcadero – are largely compatible with code written for Delphi.</li></ul><h3 id=third-party-libraries>Third-party libraries</h3><h2 id=references>References</h2><h2 id=further-reading>Further reading</h2><h2 id=external-links>External links</h2><p>from Hacker News <a class=link href=https://ift.tt/2OkEeXY target=_blank rel=noopener>https://ift.tt/2OkEeXY</a></p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-copyright><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="icon icon-tabler icon-tabler-copyright" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="2" stroke="currentcolor" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path stroke="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="9"/><path d="M14.5 9a3.5 4 0 100 6"/></svg><span>Licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</span></section></footer></article><footer class=site-footer><section class=copyright>&copy;
