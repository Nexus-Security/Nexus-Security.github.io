That means the smartphone can resist water up to 4 meters deep for 30 minutes, which would be more than enough for most users. So, why would you ever need a waterproof case for your iPhone 11 Pro? Well, the biggest reason why you would want to put on a reliable waterproof cover before diving into a swimming pool, going for an exciting water-sport or going out in rains is that liquid damage is not covered under warranty. Moreover, Apple states that water resistance decreases over time as the phone gets older. And, you wont‚Äô be able to charge your iPhone till it is wet. That‚Äôs why you better get one of the best waterproof cases for your iPhone 11 Pro to always stay on the safer side of the stream rather than pay a hefty price for the water damage repair.</p><p>_<strong>Note:</strong> We have also covered various other types of <a class=link href=https://beebom.com/best-iphone-11-pro-cases-covers/ target=_blank rel=noopener>cases for iPhone 11 Pro</a>.

Beyond the reliable water-resistance, these covers sport shockproof design and offer an additional safeguard for the triple-lens camera and Super Retina XDR display. Thanks largely to the shockproof construction, they are designed to be an ideal defender against all threats like rains, drops, scratches, snow, and dust. With that said, let‚Äôs find out which one of these top waterproof covers looks spot-on for your smartphone!</p><h2 id=1-lifeproof-frƒì>1. Lifeproof FRƒí</h2><p>Putting Lifeproof‚Äôs FRƒí at the top of this roundup feels like doing an age-old norm. To me, the best part about this waterproof cover is the <strong>impressive design</strong> that stands out in a seemingly crowded market. Well, if you often have to encounter rains or thundershowers and want a waterproof case for regular use, this has to be your top pick. Apart from the adorable profile, it has also got <strong>enough resistance to fight out the impact as well.</strong> And with the grippy sides, the cover feels more comfortable in the hands. But the only thing that may force you to think twice before going for this premium waterproof cover for iPhone 11 Pro is the high-price tag that stands head and shoulders above the pricing of other cases in the market.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Lifeproof-FRE.jpg loading=lazy alt="Lifeproof FRE - waterproof cases for iPhone 11 Pro"></p><p><em><strong>Buy from Lifeproof:</strong></em> <a class=link href=https://www.lifeproof.com/en-us/fre-for-iphone-11-pro/lpfr-apl-iph19.html target=_blank rel=noopener>$89.99</a></p><h2 id=2-antshare>2. ANTSHARE</h2><p>When you have a top-notch waterproof case like ANTSHARE safeguarding your iPhone, you will relish your adventurous activities like swimming or diving to the fullest ‚Äì without having to worry about the protection of your device. More than the <strong>reliable IP68 waterproof rating</strong>, what I like about this cover is the ability to offer all-around defense to the device. Whether it‚Äôs the <strong>rugged frame, hard back-panel or the scratch-resistant screen protector</strong>, it has covered all the basics. What‚Äôs more, ANTSHARE also supports wireless charging so that there is no need to take off the cover before charging the device, which is yet another plus from a user-experience point of view.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/wired.jpg loading=lazy alt=ANTSHARE></p><p><strong><em>Buy from Amazon:</em></strong> <a class=link href=https://geni.us/q7aqy target=_blank rel=noopener><em>$20.99</em></a></p><h2 id=3-temdan>3. Temdan</h2><p>Tedman is well-know for producing high-quality waterproof cases. And this offering for the 5.8-inch iPhone 11 Pro also lives up to the reputation. The case supports IP68 waterproof rating (6.6ft/1 hour) and has a <strong>shock-absorbing design</strong> that makes it an ideal asset for all conditions. I mean whether you want to shield your smartphone against water or protect it from nasty bumps, the cover can stand up to the task fairly well. Besides, it also features a <strong>responsive screen protector</strong> so that you can continue to use your device without any inconvenience. Just like ANTSHARE Tedman waterproof case is also compatible with wireless charging.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Tamdem.jpg loading=lazy alt="Tamdem - waterproof cases for iPhone 11 Pro"></p><p><strong><em>Buy from Amazon:</em></strong> <a class=link href=https://geni.us/KPzQjqA target=_blank rel=noopener><em>$19.99</em></a></p><h2 id=4-lamcase>4. Lamcase</h2><p>What has caught my eyes in Lamcase is the ability to <strong>resist water up to 2 meters deep for than 3 hours</strong>. Well, if the claim holds true, the case can be your top bet for not only shielding your device against water but also enjoying water sport to the fullest. Beyond the appreciable waterproof rating, Lamcase is also quite good at enduring impact due mainly to the <strong>hard plastic construction</strong>. There is also a built-in screen protector to offer the much-required defense to the expensive OLED display against scuffs. Considering the impressive specs, a $19.99 price-tag makes this waterproof cover a smart pick.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Lamcase.png loading=lazy alt=Lamcase></p><p><em><strong>Buy from Amazon:</strong> <a class=link href=https://geni.us/AEpLx5l target=_blank rel=noopener>$19.99</a></em></p><h2 id=5-eonfine>5. Eonfine</h2><p>Featuring rugged construction, Eonfine waterproof case offers reliable safeguards to your iPhone 11 Pro not only from water but also from nasty bumps. With this cover installed, your iPhone will stay protected underwater up to 6.6 feet deep for 30 minutes. And with the <strong>810G-516 military-grade protection</strong>, the device can withstand a drop from 6.6 feet in height. The cover features a top-grade screen guard to protect the Super Retina XDR display from scratches. Plus, there is an additional <strong>beveled edge on the back</strong> to prevent scuffs from damaging the triple-lens camera.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/eoo.jpg loading=lazy alt="Eonfine waterproof case"></p><p><strong><em>Buy from Amazon:</em></strong> <em><a class=link href=https://geni.us/hhjy1 target=_blank rel=noopener>$23.99</a></em></p><h2 id=6-justcool>6. Justcool</h2><p>I always prefer a waterproof case that has a compact form-factor and provides a secure grip. That‚Äôs the reason why Justcool has appealed to my penchant. Despite having a durable construction, the cover <strong>doesn‚Äôt look bulky</strong> unlike many other waterproof covers in the market. And with the rugged frame, the cover also <strong>offers grippy hold which prevents slip off.</strong> Another thing that I like about this cover is the responsive buttons that are easy to deal with. As for the screen guard, it offers better clarity and is also pretty responsive to the touch. Overall, Justcool is an ideal waterproof cover for the iPhone 11 Pro.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Justcool-.jpg loading=lazy alt=Justcool>¬†<strong><em>Buy from Amazon:</em></strong> <a class=link href=https://geni.us/NclS target=_blank rel=noopener><em>$17.99</em></a></p><h2 id=7-potalux>7. Potalux</h2><p>Simply put, Potalux is one of the most <strong>protective waterproof covers</strong> for the iPhone 11 Pro. While the durable frame plays a major role in resisting impact, the clear back offers some freedom to the device to shine through. Moreover, it keeps the camera and screen protected from scratches thanks to the inclusion of beveled edges on the front and rear sides. And yes, Potalux also <strong>works with most wireless charging pads and stands</strong> in the market so that you can power up your device without any issue.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Potalux.jpg loading=lazy alt=Potalux></p><p><strong><em>Buy from Amazon:</em></strong> <a class=link href=https://geni.us/PoY5UHE target=_blank rel=noopener><em>$18.99</em></a></p><h2 id=8-garcoo>8. Garcoo</h2><p>Garcoo claims to <strong>deliver a 360-degree shield to your iPhone</strong>. And looking at the robust casing of the cover, I must say that it has got the quality to be a trusted defender of your smartphone. Thanks to the IP68 waterproof rating, the case can keep your device protected up to 2 meters underwater for 30 minutes. Moreover, shockproof construction can <strong>withstand drops from 2m in height</strong>. To offer extra protection for the 5.8-inch Super Retina XDR display and triple-lens camera, the waterproof case also features raised lips. On top of all, Garcoo comes at $16.99 that makes it one of the most affordable waterproof cases for iPhone 11 Pro.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Garco.jpg loading=lazy alt="Garco - waterproof cases for iPhone 11 Pro"></p><p><strong><em>Buy from Amazon:</em></strong> <a class=link href=https://geni.us/AjKf target=_blank rel=noopener><em>$16.99</em></a></p><h2 id=9-redpepper>9. RedPepper</h2><p>This waterproof case from RedPepper is an easy pick for three prime reasons. For starters, the cover has a <strong>form-fitting design</strong> that not only makes a decent pair with the iPhone but also offers an anti-slip grip so that the device remains steady in the hands. Then, it can resist water up to 2 meters deep for 30 minutes which is good enough for a fun-filled adventure in the pool or reliable protection in the rain. Besides, the cover is <strong>equally strong at withstanding shock and providing the needed protection to the camera and screen</strong>. The compatibility with wireless chargers and responsive screen protectors make it a safe bet. Oh yes, it‚Äôs also priced at just $17 which makes it a fine option for the folks who are looking for a good waterproof cover at a low price point.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/red.jpg loading=lazy alt="RedPepper - waterproof cases for iPhone 11 Pro"></p><p><strong><em>Buy from Amazon:</em></strong> <a class=link href=https://geni.us/NtiGtS target=_blank rel=noopener><em>$16.99</em></a></p><h2 id=10-spidercase>10. SPIDERCASE</h2><p>I have found SPIDERCASE waterproof cover up to the mark. In terms of protection from water, the case can shield your smartphone up to 2 meters deep in water for 30 minutes which is more than decent for fun-filled swimming in the pool or water sport. That apart, the cover has also got <strong>an impact-resistant construction</strong> with fortified corners and rugged back-panel. So, it‚Äôs fully equipped to protect your smartphone during tough times. Lastly, just like many other rivals in the market, this waterproof cover is also **designed to work with wireless chargers.¬†**</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/sppp.png loading=lazy alt=SPIDERCASE></p><p><strong><em>Buy from Amazon:</em></strong> <a class=link href=https://geni.us/kfHxD target=_blank rel=noopener><em>$15.99</em></a></p><p><strong>SEE ALSO: <a class=link href=https://beebom.com/best-iphone-11-iphone-11-pro-and-11-pro-max-accessories/ target=_blank rel=noopener>17 Best iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max Accessories</a></strong></p><h2 id=choose-the-most-protective-waterproof-case-for-your-iphone-11-pro>Choose the Most Protective Waterproof Case for Your iPhone 11 Pro</h2><p>Even though Apple has vastly improved water-resistance, waterproof cases are here to stay ‚Äì at least for now.
