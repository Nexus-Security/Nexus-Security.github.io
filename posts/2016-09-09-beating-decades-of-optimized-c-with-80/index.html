This also means GHC can&rsquo;t garbage collect our list as we iterate through it since we&rsquo;re still using it in other places. The fact that we&rsquo;re keeping every character of the file in a linked list helps explain the 2.4 GB of memory on a file that&rsquo;s only 90 MB! Ouch!</p><p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s REALLY not great. Let&rsquo;s see if we can get this down to a SINGLE pass over the structure. We&rsquo;re accumulating 3 simple things, so maybe we can process all three parts at once? When iterating through a structure to get one final result I reach for folds!</p><p>It&rsquo;s pretty easy to use a fold to count characters or lines; the character count always adds one to the total, the line count adds one when the current character is a newline; but what about the word count? We can&rsquo;t add one on every space character because consecutive spaces doesn&rsquo;t count as a new word! We&rsquo;ll need to keep track of whether the previous character was a space, and only add one to the counter whenever we start a completely <strong>new</strong> word. That&rsquo;s not too tough to do; we&rsquo;ll use <code>foldl'</code> from <code>Data.List</code> for our implementation.</p><div class=highlight><div class=chroma><table class=lntable><tr><td class=lntd><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code><span class=lnt>1

The program takes more than a few minutes and quickly spikes up to more than 3 GB of memory! What&rsquo;s gone wrong? Well, we used the strict version of <code>foldl</code> (indicated by the trailing tick <code>'</code>); BUT it&rsquo;s only strict up to &ldquo;Weak Head Normal Form&rdquo; (WHNF), which means it&rsquo;ll be strict in the <strong>structure</strong> of the tuple accumulator, but not the actual values! That&rsquo;s annoying, because it means we&rsquo;re building up a HUGE thunk of additions that we never fully evaluate until we&rsquo;ve finished iterating through the whole file! Sometimes laziness sneaks in and bites us like this. This is the sort of memory leak that can easily take down web-servers if you aren&rsquo;t careful!</p><p>90 MB test file:</p><p>wc</p><p>simple-fold-wc</p><p>time</p><p>0.37s</p><p>longer than I want to wait</p><p>max mem.</p><p>1.86 MB</p><p>> 3 GB</p><p>We can fix it by telling GHC to strictly evaluate the contents of the tuple on ever iteration.

Even though laziness has already bitten us on this problem, now that we&rsquo;ve localized the laziness into the right places it provides us with streaming for free! The streaming happens naturally because <code>readFile</code> actually does <strong>lazy IO</strong>; which can be a real nuisance sometimes for things like web servers since you&rsquo;re never quite sure when the IO is happening, but in our case it gives us much better memory residency.</p><h2 id=better-with-bytestrings>Better with ByteStrings</h2><p>We can probably stop worrying about memory for now, so we&rsquo;re back to crunching for performance! One thing I can think to try there to switch to using a ByteString rather than a String. Using a String means we&rsquo;re implicitly decoding the file as we read it, which takes time, AND we have the overhead of using a linked list for the whole thing, we can&rsquo;t easily take advantage of batching or buffering our data as we read it.</p><p>This change is actually laughably easy, the <code>bytestring</code> package provides the module: <code>Data.ByteString.Lazy.Char8</code>, which provides operations for working with Lazy ByteStrings as though they were strings of characters, but with all the performance benefits of ByteStrings. Note that it DOESN&rsquo;T actually verify that each byte is a valid Character, or do any decoding, so it&rsquo;s on us to make sure we&rsquo;re passing it valid data. By default <code>wc</code> assumes its input is ASCII, so I think we&rsquo;re safe to do the same. If our input is ASCII then the functions in this module will behave sensibly.</p><p>Literally the only changes I need to make are to switch the <code>Data.List</code> import to <code>Data.ByteString.Lazy.Char8</code> and then switch the <code>readFile</code> and <code>foldl'</code> functions to their ByteString versions:</p><div class=highlight><div class=chroma><table class=lntable><tr><td class=lntd><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code><span class=lnt>1

Our memory usage has increased slightly, but it still seems to be a constant overhead. We&rsquo;re still orders of magnitude away from <code>wc</code> unfortunately; let&rsquo;s see if there&rsquo;s anything else we could do.</p><h2 id=moving-to-monoids>Moving to Monoids</h2><p>At this point I feel like experimenting a little. Modern PC&rsquo;s tend to have multiple cores, and it seems as though newer machines scale up the number of cores moreso than their processor speed, so it would be beneficial to take advantage of that.</p><p>Splitting up a computation like this isn&rsquo;t exactly trivial. In order to use multiple cores we&rsquo;ll need to split up the job into pieces. In theory this is easy, just split the file into chunks and give one chunk to each core! As you think a bit deeper about it the problems start to appear; combining character counts is pretty easy, we can just sum the totals from each chunk. The same with line-counts, but word counts pose a problem! What happens if we split in the middle of a word, or in the middle of several consecutive spaces? In order to combine the word counts we&rsquo;d need to keep track of the starting and end state of each chunk and be intelligent when we combine them together. That sounds like a lot of book-keeping that I don&rsquo;t really want to do.</p><p>Monoids to the rescue! The associative laws of a Monoid mean that so long as we can develop a lawful monoid it WILL work properly in spite of this type of parallelism. That really just passes the buck down the line though, is it possible to write a Monoid that can handle the complexities of word-counting like this?</p><p>It sure is! It may not be immediately apparent how a monoid like this works, but there&rsquo;s a class of counting problems that all fall into the same category like this, and luckily for me I&rsquo;ve worked on these before. Basically we need to count the number of times a given invariant has <strong>changed</strong> from the start to the end of a sequence. I&rsquo;ve generalized this class of monoid before, naming them <a class=link href=http://hackage.haskell.org/package/flux-monoid target=_blank rel=noopener><code>flux</code> monoids</a>. What we need to do is count the number of times we change from characters which ARE spaces to those which AREN&rsquo;T spaces. We could probably express this using the <code>Flux</code> monoid itself, but since we need to be so careful about strictness and performance I&rsquo;m going to define a bespoke version of the Flux monoid for our purposes.

The trick here is actually in reading in our data.

We could try <strong>streaming</strong> it in and splitting it that way, but then we have to <strong>process</strong> the first chunk before we get to the second split; and hopefully you can see the problem there. Instead I&rsquo;m going to spin up a separate thread for each core we have then open a separate file handle in each of those threads. Then I&rsquo;ll seek each Handle to disjoint offsets and perform our operation on each non-overlapping piece of the file that way before combining the counts together.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s the whole thing, did I mention how much I <strong>love</strong> writing concurrent code in Haskell?</p><div class=highlight><div class=chroma><table class=lntable><tr><td class=lntd><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code><span class=lnt>1

</span></span></span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></div><p>There&rsquo;s a lot going on here, so I&rsquo;ll break it down as best I can.</p><p>We can import the number of &ldquo;capabilities&rdquo; available to our program (i.e. the number of cores we have access to) from <code>GHC.Conc</code>. From there, we run a fileStat on the file we want to count to get the number of bytes in the file. From there, we use integer division to determine how many bytes should be handled by each individual core. The integer division rounds the result down, so we&rsquo;ll have to be careful to pick up the bytes that were possibly left out later on. We then use <code>forConcurrently</code> from <code>Control.Concurrent.Async</code> to run a separate thread for each of our capabilities.</p><p>Inside each thread we check whether we&rsquo;re inside the thread which handls the LAST chunk of the file, if we are we should read until the EOF to pick up the leftover bytes from the earlier rounding error, otherwise we want to limit ourselves to processing only <code>chunkSize</code> bytes. Then we can calculate our offset into the file by multiplying the chunk size by our thread number. We open a binary file handle and use <code>hSeek</code> to move our handle to the starting offset for our thread. From this point we can simply read our allocated number of bytes and fold them down using the same logic as before. After we&rsquo;ve handled each of the threads, we&rsquo;ll use a simple <code>fold</code> to combine the counts of each chunk into a total count.</p><p>We use <code>&lt;$!></code> in a few spots to add additional strictness since we want to ensure that the folding operations happen within each thread, instead of after the threads have been joined. I might go a little overboard on strictness annotations, but it&rsquo;s easier to add too many than it is to track down the places we&rsquo;ve accidentally missed them.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s take this puppy out for a spin!</p><p>After warming up the caches I ran each of them a few times on my 4 core 2013 Macbook Pro with an SSD, and averaged the results together:</p><p>543 MB test file:</p><p>wc</p><p>multicore-wc</p><p>time</p><p>2.07s</p><p>1.23s</p><p>max mem.</p><p>1.87 MB</p><p>7.06 MB</p><p>It seems to make a pretty big difference! We&rsquo;re actually going FASTER than some C code that&rsquo;s been hand optimized for a few decades. These results are best taken with a hefty grain of salt; it&rsquo;s really hard to tell what sort of caching is going on here. There are probably mutliple layers of disk caching happening. Maybe the multithreading only helps when reading files from a cache?</p><p>I did a bit of skimming and it seems that SOME storage devices might experience a speed-up from doing file reads in parallel, some may actually slow down. Your mileage may vary. If anyone&rsquo;s an expert on SSDs I&rsquo;d love to hear from you on this one. Regardless I&rsquo;m still pretty happy with the results.</p><p>In case you&rsquo;re wondering, the actual <code>User</code> time for our program comes in at <code>4.22s</code> (which is split across the 4 cores), meaning our parallel program is less efficient than the simple version in terms of actual processor cycles, but the ability to use multiple cores gets the &ldquo;real&rdquo; wall-clock time down.</p><h2 id=handling-unicode>Handling Unicode</h2><p>There&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;ve been avoiding so far, we&rsquo;ve assumed every file is simple ASCII! That&rsquo;s really not the way the world works. A lot of documents are encoded in UTF-8 these days; which turns out to be identical to an ASCII file IFF the file only contains valid ASCII characters, however if those crazy pre-teens put some Emoji in there then it&rsquo;s going to screw everything up.</p><p>The problem is two-fold; firstly we currently count BYTES not CHARACTERS, because in ASCII-land they&rsquo;re semantically the same. With our current code, if we come across a UTF-8 encoded frowny face we&rsquo;re going to count it as at least 2 characters when it should only count as one. Okay, so maybe we should actually be decoding these things, but that&rsquo;s much easier said than done because we&rsquo;re splitting the file up into chunks at arbitrary byte-counts; meaning we might end up splitting that frowny face into two different chunks, leading to an invalid decoding! What a nightmare.</p><p>This is another reason why doing a multi-threaded <code>wc</code> is probably a bad idea, but I&rsquo;m not so easily deterred. In order to proceed I&rsquo;m going to make a few assumptions:</p><ul><li>Our input will be encoded using either ASCII or UTF-8 family of encodings. There are of course other popular encodings out there; but in my limited experience most modern text files prefer one of these encodings. In fact there are <a class=link href=http://utf8everywhere.org/ target=_blank rel=noopener>entire sites</a> dedicated to making <code>UTF-8</code> the one format to rule them all.</li><li>We count only ASCII spaces and newlines as spaces and newlines; sorry <code>MONGOLIAN VOWEL SEPARATOR</code>, but you&rsquo;re cut from the team.</li></ul><p>By making these two assumptions we can exploit a few details of the UTF-8 encoding scheme to solve our problem. Firstly, we know from the UTF-8 spec that it&rsquo;s completely back-compatible with ASCII. What this means is that every ASCII byte is encoded in UTF-8 as exactly that same byte. Secondly, we know that NO other bytes in the file will conflict in encoding with a valid ASCII byte; you can see why in a chart on the <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8 target=_blank rel=noopener>UTF-8 wikipedia page</a>. Continuation bytes start with a leading &lsquo;1&rsquo;, and no ASCII bytes start with a &lsquo;1&rsquo;.</p><p>These two facts mean we can safely leave our current &lsquo;space&rsquo; detection logic the same! It&rsquo;s impossible for us to &lsquo;split&rsquo; a space or newline because they&rsquo;re all encoded in a single byte, and we know we won&rsquo;t accidentally count some byte that&rsquo;s part of a different codepoint because there&rsquo;s no overlap in encoding for the ASCII bytes. We do however need to change our character-counting logic.</p><p>One last fact about UTF-8 is that every UTF-8 encoded codepoint contains exactly one byte from the set: <code>0xxxxxxx, 110xxxxx, 1110xxxx, 11110xxx</code>. Continuation bytes ALL start with <code>10</code>, so if we count all bytes OTHER than those starting with <code>10</code> then we&rsquo;ll count each code-point exactly once, even if we split a codepoint across different chunks!</p><p>All of these facts combined means we can write a per-byte monoid for counting UTF-8 OR ASCII characters all in one!</p><p>Actually, our current <code>Counts</code> monoid is fine, we&rsquo;ll just need to adapt our <code>countChar</code> function:</p><div class=highlight><div class=chroma><table class=lntable><tr><td class=lntd><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code><span class=lnt>1

Now we can handle UTF-8 or ASCII; we don&rsquo;t even need to know which encoding we&rsquo;re handling, we&rsquo;ll always give the right answer.</p><p><code>wc</code>, at least the version on my Macbook, has a <code>-m</code> flag for handling multi-byte characters when counting. A few quick experiments shows that telling <code>wc</code> to handle multi-byte chars slows down the process pretty significantly (it now decodes every byte); let&rsquo;s see how our version does in comparison. (I&rsquo;ve confirmed they get the same results when running on a large UTF-8 encoded document with many non-ASCII characters)</p><p>543 MB test file:</p><p>wc -mwl</p><p>multicore-utf8-wc</p><p>time</p><p>5.56s</p><p>3.07s</p><p>max mem.</p><p>1.86 MB</p><p>7.52 MB</p><p>Just as we suspect, we come out pretty far ahead! Our new version is a bit slower than when we just counted every byte (we&rsquo;re now doing a few extra bit-checks), so it&rsquo;s probably a good idea to add a <code>utf</code> flag to our program so we can always run as fast as possible for a given input.</p><h2 id=conclusions>Conclusions</h2><p>So; how does our high-level garbage-collected runtime-based language Haskell stack up? Pretty dang well I&rsquo;d say! We ended up really quite close with our single-core lazy-bytestring <code>wc</code>. Switching to a multi-core approach ultimately allowed us to pull ahead! Whether our <code>wc</code> clone is faster in practice without a warmed up disk-cache is something that should be considered, but in terms of raw performance we&rsquo;re still winning this one.</p><p>Haskell as a language isn&rsquo;t perfect, but if I can get ball-park comparable performance to a C program while writing much higher-level fully type-checked code then I&rsquo;ll call that a win any day.</p><p>Hopefully you learned something ü§û!
