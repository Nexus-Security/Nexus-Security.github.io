rel=noopener>#</a>Static is the new Dynamic</h2><p>Throughout 2019 we have continued to see the growth of the <em>JAMstack</em>. The idea is quite simple: Any website or app you <a class=link href=https://nextjs.org target=_blank rel=noopener>build</a> and <a class=link href=https://zeit.co target=_blank rel=noopener>deploy</a> will use the stack of client-side _J_avaScript, _A_PIs, and _M_arkup.</p><p>By now, client-side JavaScript (like React and Vue) and APIs (like REST and GraphQL) are quite mainstream, but my favorite part is the assumption that your markup will be <strong>static</strong>.</p><p>First: Why Static?</p><ul><li>Static is <strong>globally fast</strong>. When you deploy, we can <em>hoist</em> all your static assets to a global CDN network. By removing the server from the equation, we can also maximize availability by reducing and even altogether eliminating cache misses.</li><li>Static is <strong>consistently fast</strong>. It gives you &ldquo;O(1) <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_first_byte target=_blank rel=noopener>TTFB</a>&rdquo;, which is a fancy way of saying you get stable and predictable latency to the first byte of the screen. Always, because no code, servers, sockets, or databases are involved.</li><li>Static is <strong>always online</strong>. This should <a class=link href=https://twitter.com/rauchg/status/1210294503216578560 target=_blank rel=noopener>not be surprising</a>, but servers frequently go down and <a class=link href=https://kccncna19.sched.com/event/Uads/the-gotchas-of-zero-downtime-traffic-w-kubernetes-leigh-capili-weaveworks target=_blank rel=noopener>involve complex rollout schemes</a><a class=link href=https://rauchg.com/2020/2019-in-review#f1 target=_blank rel=noopener>[1]</a>, while static files are trivially cacheable and simple to serve. The odds of you getting paged during the holidays because a &ldquo;static asset can&rsquo;t be served from a CDN&rdquo; are basically zero.</li></ul><p>Second: Really, Static? I have <em>dynamic</em> needs.</p><p>Servers are not going away, but they are <em>moving around and hiding</em>.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Static Site Generation (SSG)</strong> can be thought of moving around the servers and taking them away from the hot path. Instead of putting a server in between the user&rsquo;s request and the response, we compute the response ahead of time.</p><p>This subtle shift pays back handsomely. One, anything that could go wrong, goes wrong at build time, maximizing <strong>availability</strong>. Two, we compute once and re-use, minimizing <strong>database or API load</strong>. Three, the resulting static HTML is <strong>fast</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Client-side _J_S and _A_PIs</strong> that get executed later, once the static markup and code is downloaded and executed, allow for effectively infinite dynamism.</p><p>Pre-computing all pages is not always possible<a class=link href=https://rauchg.com/2020/2019-in-review#f2 target=_blank rel=noopener>[2]</a>, nor desirable. For example, when dealing with data that is <em>not</em> shared between all users and we wouldn&rsquo;t want to cache at the edge<a class=link href=https://rauchg.com/2020/2019-in-review#f3 target=_blank rel=noopener>[3]</a>.</p></li></ul><h2 id=httpsrauchgcom20202019-in-reviewnext-the-next-frontiernextjs-the-next-frontier><a class=link href=https://rauchg.com/2020/2019-in-review#next-the-next-frontier target=_blank rel=noopener>#</a>Next.js, the next frontier</h2><p>Next.js has continued to grow in adoption and now powers the likes of Hulu, Tencent News, Twitch, AT&T, Auth0 and the <a class=link href=http://nextjs.org/showcase target=_blank rel=noopener>list goes on</a>.</p><p>Thanks to its simplicity, it&rsquo;s a compelling all-in-one solution for the full straddle of JAMstack: from a static landing page, to very large websites, to fully dynamic applications.</p><p>The &ldquo;secret sauce&rdquo; continues to be its simple <code>pages/</code> system inspired by <code>cgi-bin</code> and throwing <code>.php</code> files in a FTP webroot.</p><p>A page is <em>just</em> a React component. The simplest Next.js app is <code>pages/index.js</code> which will serve the route <code>/</code>:</p><div class=highlight><div class=chroma><table class=lntable><tr><td class=lntd><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code><span class=lnt>1

Servers (SSR) are still fully supported and no apps have been harmed as part of this evolution.</p><p>We think there&rsquo;s enormous value in empowering teams to instantly build and deploy JAMstack websites, with no servers or infra to manage or configure.</p><p>True to our style, deploying any static site (like just a <code>index.html</code>) or more complex and full-featured frameworks like Next.js, Gatsby, Gridsome, ‚Ä¶ begins with just:</p><p>The <a class=link href=https://zeit.co target=_blank rel=noopener>ZEIT Now</a> platform gives you a comprehensive workflow with built-in CI/CD and global CDN, that are carefully optimized for production-grade dynamic sites.</p><p>A salient feature is the transition we are seeing <strong>away from code <em>review</em></strong> into <strong>deployment <em>preview</em></strong>.</p><p>Code review is undeniably important (specially <a class=link href=https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/reviewer/speed.html target=_blank rel=noopener>speedy code review</a>), but nothing beats teams collaborating by sharing URLs to the <em>actual</em> sites that are being worked on and experiencing them directly.</p><p>By setting up a <a class=link href=https://zeit.co/github target=_blank rel=noopener>Git integration</a>, every single <code>git push</code> gets its own live deployment URL. Thanks to the simplifications granted by the model, deployments are orders of magnitude faster to build, deploy and serve than when using servers or containers, which only adds to the great team-wide collaboration experience.</p><p>Every push and branch gets its own deploy URL</p><h2 id=httpsrauchgcom20202019-in-reviewtesting-the-jamstackthe-deploy-url-the-center-of-gravity><a class=link href=https://rauchg.com/2020/2019-in-review#testing-the-jamstack target=_blank rel=noopener>#</a>The Deploy URL, the Center of Gravity</h2><p>An interesting consequence of being able to deploy so fast and so frequently is that it completely changes <strong>testing and quality assurance</strong>.</p><p>Every URL like <code>[https://blog-p2pe8jedz.now.sh](https://blog-p2pe8jedz.now.sh)</code>, a preview deployment of this blog as I was writing this post, is a <strong>real, production-like environment</strong> just like the <code>rauchg.com</code> one.</p><p>This means that instead of running tests that make all kinds of assumptions about the environment (like mocking it), we can instead test the <em>real thing</em>. As real as it gets.</p><p>A new spin on <a class=link href="https://twitter.com/rauchg/status/807626710350839808?lang=en" target=_blank rel=noopener>an old classic</a></p><p>The most natural form of &ldquo;e2e testing&rdquo; is experiencing the end result itself by visiting the URL. Sharing it with customers, co-workers and your manager.</p><p>But in 2019, we also witnessed the incredible power of delegating automated testing against this URL to other services.</p><p>The URL as the center of the app-building universe</p><p>When you install our <a class=link href=https://zeit.co/github target=_blank rel=noopener>GitHub app</a>, we don&rsquo;t just register a &ldquo;Check&rdquo; like other CI providers in the pull request. We also say: <em>this is a <strong>deployment</strong>, here is the URL</em>.</p><p>In <em>parallel</em>, a series of assurance checks can then be run against that prod-ready URL. This includes, but is not limited to:</p><ul><li><strong>Browser Testing</strong>, simulating user journeys and real interactions</li><li><strong>Screenshot Testing</strong>, to automatically prevent visual regressions</li><li><strong>HTTP Assertion Testing</strong>, requesting APIs or pages and verifying the outputs</li><li><strong>Manual QA</strong>, with designated reviewers who approve the PR.</li></ul><p>Checks are automatically run against the deploy URL</p><h2 id=httpsrauchgcom20202019-in-reviewflaky-tests-flaky-uxflaky-tests-mean-flaky-ux><a class=link href=https://rauchg.com/2020/2019-in-review#flaky-tests-flaky-ux target=_blank rel=noopener>#</a>Flaky Tests mean Flaky UX</h2><p>When it comes to testing, I&rsquo;ve found myself referencing this insight quite frequently:</p><p>As developers, we might sometimes be too quick to place the blame on tools (or the <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aether_%28classical_element%29 target=_blank rel=noopener>aether</a>) and just press the restart button.</p><p>But the truly important question to ask is: what if it had been one of your customers, instead of an automated test? Would they not have had a <em>flaky</em> experience? Would it be ok to tell them to press F5 and try again?</p><h2 id=httpsrauchgcom20202019-in-reviewserverless-upgrades-itselfserverless-means-infrastructure-that-upgrades-itself><a class=link href=https://rauchg.com/2020/2019-in-review#serverless-upgrades-itself target=_blank rel=noopener>#</a>Serverless means infrastructure that upgrades itself</h2><p>Serverless is an exciting trend that has resisted a universal definition. Asking what serverless <em>really</em> means probably got you 5 different answers in 2018, and 10 different answers in 2019.</p><p>However, a defining characteristic that I&rsquo;ve become a fan of is that serverless means your <strong>infrastructure upgrades itself</strong>.</p><p>This includes everything from upgrading the operating system, to patching the system&rsquo;s OpenSSL, to bumping the version of the Node.js function runtime.</p><p>This wonderful effect is particularly pronounced for databases. It&rsquo;s one thing to upgrade the infrastructure of <em>stateless</em> code execution, but dealing with data is a whole new challenge that I&rsquo;m glad we no longer have to deal with<a class=link href=https://rauchg.com/2020/2019-in-review#f4 target=_blank rel=noopener>[4]</a>.</p><p>I recently learned about <a class=link href=https://www.hyrumslaw.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Hyrum&rsquo;s Law</a>, which states:</p><blockquote><p>With a sufficient number of users of an API, it does not matter what you promise in the contract: all observable behaviors of your system will be depended on by somebody.</p></blockquote><p>Which obviously has a <em>relevant xkcd</em> as prior art:</p><p>There is always an xkcd for that</p><h2 id=httpsrauchgcom20202019-in-reviewmicroservices-complex-unavailablemicroservices-increase-complexity-and-reduce-availability><a class=link href=https://rauchg.com/2020/2019-in-review#microservices-complex-unavailable target=_blank rel=noopener>#</a>Microservices increase complexity and reduce availability</h2><p>Microservices allow you to break down a service&rsquo;s dependencies into independently deployable units.</p><p>The problem? The assurances that were previously statically guaranteed by the compiler or runtime for a given piece of software are now gone. What was before a unit becomes a distributed system.</p><p>Not only are microservices harder to <em>manage</em> than, say, a static blob of code together with its dependencies inside a function or container, but odds are they are also <strong>less available</strong>.</p><p>This should already be obvious from at least one angle: introducing an <em>additional</em> network hop can only make things worse.</p><p>Kevin Mahoney has provided a new <a class=link href=http://kevinmahoney.co.uk/articles/microservices-and-availability/ target=_blank rel=noopener>neat mathematical illustration</a> of the availability problem of inter-connecting services:</p><blockquote><p>Take the example where service C depends on services A and B[‚Ä¶]</p><p>If A has an availability of 0.8 (80%) and B 0.95 (95%), C will have a best case of 0.8 (80%), an average case of 0.8 √ó 0.95 = 0.76 (76%), and a worst case of 1 - ((1 - 0.8) + (1 - 0.95)) = 0.75 (75%)</p></blockquote><p>Making your serverless functions &ldquo;monolithic&rdquo; offers a compelling solution to this problem. Statically bind the dependencies of each function (<a class=link href=https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9#api-routes target=_blank rel=noopener>Next.js API routes</a> and the Go compiler do this) and avoid introducing unneeded service hops of your own.</p><h2 id=httpsrauchgcom20202019-in-reviewnative-means-platform-fidelitynative-means-platform-fidelity-not-native-code><a class=link href=https://rauchg.com/2020/2019-in-review#native-means-platform-fidelity target=_blank rel=noopener>#</a>Native means Platform Fidelity, not Native Code</h2><p>The word &ldquo;native&rdquo; has always bothered me. No one can seem to agree on a definition, but we all agree that &ldquo;native apps&rdquo; are always optimal.</p><p>Many people are quick to write off attempting to write a desktop app or mobile app in JavaScript on the basis that it&rsquo;s <em>not native</em>.
