Besides, Apple‚Äôs sort of hypersensitive approach also ensures spammers and data trackers don‚Äôt have a free run. But that doesn‚Äôt mean Macs are immune to malware or spyware attacks. In fact, if you have been able to keep a close watch at macOS recently, you would already know that Apple‚Äôs offering has fallen prey to several viruses including mshelper, CrescentCore, and OSX/Linker. Well, that just goes on to bust the age-old myth that Mac users don‚Äôt need to have an extra layer of shield against viruses. If you don‚Äôt want to put your sensitive information at risk, get the best antivirus for your Mac in 2020.</p><h2 id=best-mac-antivirus-software-in-2020>Best Mac Antivirus Software in 2020</h2><p>Choosing the right antivirus solution out of a variety of offerings could be a little tricky. So, fixing the priority right at the beginning would be a much better way to go.</p><h3 id=what-sort-of-antivirus-solutions-should-you-choose>What Sort of Antivirus Solutions Should You Choose?</h3><p>Courtesy an ever-growing competition, today you have the luxury to choose from dozens of paid and free antivirus for Mac (<a class=link href=https://beebom.com/best-antivirus-for-windows-10/ target=_blank rel=noopener>and of course Windows</a>). If you are not a power user, a free package with basic protection against viruses should be sufficient for you. But just in case you are dealing with highly sensitive files and want to ramp up the arsenal to fight out all the malicious attacks including adware, ransomware, and malware, a premium offering would be the right pick for you.</p><p>Keep in mind, most security software goes well beyond just safeguarding your Mac against viruses. For instance, many of them come with built-in <a class=link href=https://beebom.com/best-password-managers-2018/ target=_blank rel=noopener>password managers</a>, <a class=link href=https://beebom.com/best-free-vpn-services/ target=_blank rel=noopener>VPNs</a>, and super handy <a class=link href=https://beebom.com/set-up-parental-control-mac-macos-catalina/ target=_blank rel=noopener>parental controls</a> to help you keep the online activity of you and your family under the watch. To make your job a tad easier, we have highlighted the features of each software and also given a short verdict based on what they have to offer. With that said, let‚Äôs explore the roundup of the top antivirus solutions for macOS!</p><h2 id=1-norton>1. Norton</h2><p>Norton has been in the game for several years as a trusted player. So, it deserves a chance to get your attention. The security software is <strong>both feature-packed and offers the needed flexibility to customize everything in line with your needs</strong>. Interface-wise, the software looks neat so getting a hang of the features seems less demanding.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Norton-Antivirus-software-for-Mac-.jpg loading=lazy alt="Norton Antivirus software for Mac"></p><p>On the security front, Norton comes with multiple tools to ward off hacking and data tracking. With the smart firewall, it offers the required shield to your data. Plus, it also comes with <strong>online threats and virus protection</strong> to keep all of your sensitive information guarded. But what has caught my eyes in this security software is the <strong>handy password manager</strong> which makes handling the secure codes a painless exercise. If you often find it a bit inconvenient to deal with your passwords, you should keep this feature in mind.</p><p>In an age where data hacking seems to have become the order of the day, there had never been more demand for VPN. Understanding this need, Norton provides a fast and reliable VPN to shield your online privacy. So, you can browse the web anonymously as your personal information will be safe. Depending on the plan you choose, the software also offers <a class=link href=https://beebom.com/dropbox-altenatives-cloud-storage-services/ target=_blank rel=noopener>cloud backup</a> to keep your files safe and accessible across devices. As for pricing, Norton antivirus comes at $19.99/year/user which seems kind of a steal given the host of security features. Everything considered; it‚Äôs one of the best antivirus packages for Mac that you can get right now.</p><p><em><strong>Price:</strong> $19.99/year/Mac (basic)</em></p><p><em><strong>Visit:</strong> <a class=link href="https://buy-static.norton.com/norton/ps/bb/inhard/360/in_en_nort_branded-gen.html?ds_rl=1277673&om_sem_cid=hho_sem_sy:in:ggl:en:e:br:kw0000001532:403766452978:c&country=IN&ds_rl=1277673" target=_blank rel=noopener>Website¬†</a></em></p><h2 id=2-intego>2. intego</h2><p>If Norton claims to be the best in the business, intego antivirus package for Mac isn‚Äôt behind either. The security software ticks off all essential boxes to become a strong contender in the market. What stands it out from many other rivals is the ability to <strong>eliminate malware with more precision</strong>. So, if you are on the lookout to get full-fledged antivirus software that can fight out malware without any blemish, it is your top bet.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Intego-antivirus-software-for-Mac-.jpg loading=lazy alt="Intego antivirus software for Mac"></p><p>Another department where intego has an edge over many other counterparts is real-time protection. The software comes with <strong>a variety of shields against phishing, explicit content, and duplicate files.</strong> Therefore, you can not only ward off phishing and inappropriate content but also prevent your Mac from being cluttered by unnecessary files.</p><p>Often find your kids breaking the set rules? Well, you can use this security software to <strong>keep track of your children‚Äôs activity</strong> so that their usage remains guarded. Moreover, the software can also help you quickly access your favorite files, organize the desktop, and all the files in accordance with your needs. Should you want a Mac antivirus that can deliver better defense against malware and also help you keep the clutter away from your computer, intego would be a better choice.</p><p>_<strong>Price:</strong> $39.99/year/Mac, 30-day free trial¬†¬†_</p><p><em><strong>Visit:</strong> <a class=link href="https://antivirus.intego.com/en/mpbx9-promotion?media_source=google_adwords&campaign=Global-Search-Brand-Desktop&adgroup=Intego_Exact&keyword=intego%20antivirus&matchtype=e&extension=&coupon=1Y24X2&gclid=CjwKCAiA0svwBRBhEiwAHqKjFtwNZg6EVTW7pGfiDn1YLd98W0wJICn5VhhRWcOICJiiQXbY1vY3_BoCe4oQAvD_BwE" target=_blank rel=noopener>Website¬†</a></em></p><h2 id=3-bitdefender>3. Bitdefender</h2><p>For those looking for the best of both worlds: <strong>top-notch safeguard against virus and a comparatively affordable price</strong>, Bitdefender appears to be an easy-picking. The software has been on the scene for several years and comes with a whole host of tools to get rid of viruses, ransomware, and malware. Besides, it also has the reputation of offering one of the fastest and in-depth scans.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Bitdefender.jpg loading=lazy alt="Bitdefender antivirus for Mac "></p><p>Apart from the deep scan, I find its defense against privacy invasion highly appreciable. The software allows you to <strong>keep a close eye on the webcam and microphone</strong>, ensuring you have the desired control over privacy. On the parental control front, I rate Bitdefender slightly higher than its counterparts thanks largely to a variety of settings. So, if you have an unruly kid who doesn‚Äôt like to follow your set rules, you can employ the necessary restrictions to keep him/her protected online.</p><p>Bitdefender allows you to <strong>locate, lock, and wipe out your device in case of theft or loss</strong>. This is what you need to stay in control of your data even if your device is not near you. Additionally, it has the support for multiple platforms including iOS, Android, and Windows which offer more flexibility for the folks who have a variety of devices to manage.</p><p><em><strong>Price:</strong> $23.99/year/three devices (30-day free trial)</em></p><p><em><strong>Visit:</strong> <a class=link href="https://www.bitdefender.com/media/html/consumer/new/2020/cl50off-opt/?pid=50off&cid=ppc" target=_blank rel=noopener>Website¬†</a></em></p><h2 id=4-avast>4. Avast</h2><p>I guess many of you had expected Avast to comfortably enter this roundup, hadn‚Äôt you? Frankly speaking, Avast has been one of my top picks ever since I started trying out antivirus on Mac. This security software is designed to shield your macOS device on three main fronts. It comes with a <strong>strong suite of tools to take on malware.</strong> Thus, keeping the malware attack away from your Mac shouldn‚Äôt be a big deal for you.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Avast-antivirus-software-for-macOS-.jpg loading=lazy alt="Avast antivirus software for macOS"></p><p>The second important line of defense that Avast offers is <strong>against the vulnerable Wi-Fi networks</strong>. Considering how they can jeopardize the security of personal information, it‚Äôs a notable feature. The software immediately alerts you whenever anyone joins your network. That not only helps in keeping an eye on hackers but also stops anyone from misusing the internet plan.</p><p>And the third is readied to <strong>ward off ransomware by offering a strong wall</strong> for your photos so that they won‚Äôt be encrypted with your approval. On top of all, Avast‚Äôs basic variant comes for free, which makes it probably the best free antivirus for Mac in 2020. As for the premium version, it is priced at $59.99/year which may be a touch expensive but it‚Äôs got enough goodies live up to the billing.</p><p><em><strong>Price:</strong> Free, $59.99/year</em></p><p><em><strong>Visit:</strong> <a class=link href=https://www.eset.com/in/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Website¬†</a></em></p><h2 id=5-panda>5. Panda</h2><p>Claiming to provide ultimate virus protection, Panda is the kind of security software that can fit into the taste of most people. As to whether or not it has the tools to walk the tall talk, I would say that it won‚Äôt disappoint you ‚Äì if not being able to stand out of the rest. For providing dependable antivirus protection, the software <strong>bets big on a firewall</strong> that has a good track record of detecting malicious stuff. So, you can rely on it to keep your Mac defended against viruses.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Panda.jpg loading=lazy alt="Panda antivirus solution for Mac "></p><p>Wi-Fi networks are often found to be the targets of hackers and prying neighbors. Thus, security software has <strong>put more emphasis on providing a strong cushion to the Wi-Fi networks</strong>. Additionally, the software also works pretty fast in scanning external/USB devices, making sure they remain protected from threats.</p><p>Aside from offering reasonably good parental control, password manager, shield against ransomware, it provides the much-needed <strong>data shield that allows you to encrypt all of your confidential information</strong> as well. Add to that the compatibility with several platforms (i.e Windows, and Android) as well as the availability of free variant and it seems inline for a great pick.</p><p><em><strong>Price:</strong> Free, $35.39</em></p><p><em><strong>Visit:</strong> <a class=link href="https://www.pandasecurity.com/security-promotion/?reg=IN&lang=en&track=99838&campaign=dome1802&option=mix&x-hideselection=true&coupon=35OFFMULTIP&gclid=CjwKCAiA0svwBRBhEiwAHqKjFgskG_kAEsVFlI5xrVhfQRF8CDkZAs2UiEFiymTj-I956NLXWPnT-hoChDEQAvD_BwE" target=_blank rel=noopener>Website¬†</a></em></p><h2 id=6-sophos>6. Sophos</h2><p>If you are in the market for pretty good yet free antivirus software for your Mac, look no further than Sophos. The security software may not boast a clean interface but it‚Äôs quite effective at taking on ransomware attacks. And with some really <strong>handy tools to prevent privacy invasions</strong>, it is more than capable to keep your privacy guarded. Even in terms of removing malware, I think it‚Äôs up to the task which helps it check off all the essential boxes.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Sophos-antivirus-software-for-Mac-.jpg loading=lazy alt="Sophos antivirus software for Mac"></p><p>Sophos comes with a <strong>remote security management feature</strong> that can let you view and manage your computer security. Times when you want to keep a close watch on computer security, this feature can come in super handy. Based on your preferences, you can <strong>choose a variety of filtering categories</strong> to secure online engagement with websites and social networking sites. Not to mention the web protection that ensures you are able to stay away from dangerous and blacklisted sites while using your Mac.</p><p><em><strong>Price:</strong> Free, $30/year</em></p><p><em><strong>Visit:</strong> <a class=link href=https://home.sophos.com/en-us.aspx target=_blank rel=noopener>Website¬†</a></em></p><h2 id=7-trend-micro>7. Trend Micro</h2><p>When you talk about top-notch antivirus software for Mac, it would be a big mistake to overlook Trend Micro. Yeah, you heard it right! The security software <strong>excels in blocking web threats and providing a trusted defense against ransomware.</strong> So, you will stay worry-free while surfing the web and also about the privacy of your personal information. To keep your data safe, it automatically <strong>blocks shady websites</strong> that are known to steal personal information.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Trend-Micro-antivirus-for-macOS-.jpg loading=lazy alt="Trend Micro antivirus for macOS"></p><p>Furthermore, it‚Äôs also at par when it comes to guarding against phishing emails which have become rampant these days. One of my favorite features in Trend Micro is the <strong>status report</strong> which provides a much better insight into the security of your Mac. With a number of settings on offer, you can <strong>customize everything to highlight</strong> the areas that warrant more attention. On top of all, you also get a solid set of parental controls to safeguard the online privacy of your child.</p><p>_<strong>Price:</strong> $29.95/year, 30-day free trial¬†_</p><p><em><strong>Visit:</strong> <a class=link href=https://www.trendmicro.com/en_in/forHome/products/antivirus-plus.html target=_blank rel=noopener>Website¬†</a></em></p><h2 id=8-airo>8. Airo</h2><p>Airo may not be as popular as the noted rivals mentioned above but it has got everything covered to give them stiff competition. What I have found appreciable in this software is the <strong>integration of AI technology</strong> that gets smarter with time, allowing you to nab threats and malware with ease. So, you won‚Äôt have to spend plenty of time to get rid of the culprits.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Airo-antivirus-software-for-Mac-.jpg loading=lazy alt="Airo antivirus software for Mac"></p><p>In terms of security and privacy, this <strong>Mac-only anti-virus software</strong> has a slight edge over many of its rivals. Its real-time detection is precise and spot-on catching threats. The software also allows you the needed control over all of your data, <strong>system settings and privacy</strong>. Thus, based on your requirements, you can fin-tune everything to suit your needs better.
