Spigen Tough Armor Kickstand Case</h3><p>I have a special liking for kickstand cases as they are great assets for enhanced hands-free media watching. That‚Äôs the reason why I thought it would be nice to include them in this long roster. Talking about Spigen Tough Armor, it‚Äôs <strong>well-built and offers certified military-grade safeguard (MIL-STD 810G-516.6)</strong>. The rugged construction (PC and TPU combo) armed with air-cushion technology is designed to take on beating.

But don‚Äôt go by the slim look of this clear case as it‚Äôs got enough cushion to resist shock and also prevent scratches.

As for colors, you can choose Torras clear cover in two options: crystal clear and glossy black.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Torras-clear-case-.jpg loading=lazy alt="Torras clear case"></p><p><em><strong>Buy from Amazon:</strong></em> <em>$15.99/$16.99 (for <a class=link href=https://geni.us/AeGx target=_blank rel=noopener>Pixel 4</a>/ <a class=link href=https://geni.us/Jls94k target=_blank rel=noopener>Pixel 4 XL</a>)</em></p><h3 id=6-moko-protective-clear-case>6.

So, you get kind of best of both worlds: style and protection. Moreover, it <strong>sports microdot design</strong> that keeps smudges and sweats away while also offering a much-improved grip. Not to mention, this clear suit also works perfectly with wireless charging stands and pads.

VeeR Falcon</h3><p>It‚Äôs indeed sad to know that both Google Pixel 4 and 4 XL don‚Äôt support Google‚Äôs Daydream VR. Moreover, the search giant has also announced that it will no longer sell the Daydream View headsets. However, the Daydream app will continue to support older Pixel devices. But don‚Äôt worry, there are tons of VR headsets that can let you <strong>enjoy 360-degree movies</strong> in their full glory. And for this purpose, I have found VeeR Falcon up to the mark. The headset has a modern design and comes with <strong>built-in HiFi active noise canceling technology</strong>.

It also ensures you can comfortably interact with your device and keep a track of messages and alerts during exercise. Being <strong>skin-friendly and breathable</strong>, VUP is one of the best armbands for Pixel 4 and 4 XL. Made of lycra and neoprene material, the armband is soft and lightweight. Plus, the open design along with a <strong>180-degree rotatable holder</strong> allows you to use your device conveniently ‚Äì without having to take a break from your exercise.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/VUP-armband-.jpg loading=lazy alt="VUP armband"></p><p><em><strong>Buy from Amazon:</strong> <a class=link href=https://geni.us/9xM1m target=_blank rel=noopener>$10.95</a></em></p><h2 id=best-wireless-charger-car-charger-car-mount-and-power-bank-for-pixel-4-and-pixel-4-xl>Best Wireless Charger, Car Charger, Car Mount and Power Bank for Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL</h2><h3 id=1-anker-powerwave-wireless-charging-stand>1. Anker PowerWave Wireless Charging Stand</h3><p>Anker produces arguably the best charging accessories. So, missing out on its top-notch wireless charging stand would be a blunder. The stand has a durable design and can hold your Pixel device both in portrait and landscape orientations. Another notable feature is the <strong>case-friendly design</strong> that ensures you don‚Äôt need to take off the cover from your Pixel smartphone before kickstarting the wireless charging. Furthermore, the LED indicator is designed to be <strong>sleep-friendly</strong> so that your sleep won‚Äôt be disturbed by charging.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Anker-wireless-charging-stand-.jpg loading=lazy alt="Anker wireless charging stand - Pixel 4 XL Accessories"></p><p><em><strong>Buy from Amazon:</strong> <a class=link href=https://geni.us/k63G target=_blank rel=noopener>$29.99</a></em></p><h3 id=2-belkin-boost-up-wireless-charging-pad>2. Belkin Boost Up Wireless Charging Pad</h3><p>If Anker claims to be the leader, Belkin is not behind in the race either. And should you think of buying an efficient wireless charging pad, Belkin Boost Up would make a truly premium choice. The wireless charging pad is <strong>lightweight and sports a small form-factor</strong>. With the non-slip surface, your smartphone stays steady on the pad. As for charging efficiency, it can deliver up to <strong>10W speed</strong> which puts in the top-tier segment. Around $40 price tag may seem a touch high but given the premium built and safe charging, Boost Up seems to be a good buy.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Belkin-Boost-Up-.jpg loading=lazy alt="Belkin Boost Up"></p><p><em><strong>Buy from Amazon:</strong> <a class=link href=https://geni.us/yJ8YS6 target=_blank rel=noopener>$39.59</a></em></p><h3 id=3-cluvox>3. Cluvox</h3><p>A car charger comes in super handy when you want to power up your smartphone fast and securely during a long drive. If you are willing to get an <strong>ultra-portable car charger</strong>, I would recommend you to take a close look at Cluvox. The company claims that the charger can power up compatible devices <strong>4x faster.</strong> With two USB ports and a durable Type C cable, it‚Äôs fully equipped to charge multiple devices simultaneously. Despite being compact, it‚Äôs quite durable thanks to the multi-annular design.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Culvox-car-charger-.jpg loading=lazy alt=Cluvox></p><p><em><strong>Buy from Amazon:</strong> <a class=link href=https://geni.us/XYwTq target=_blank rel=noopener>$13.99</a></em></p><h3 id=4-encased-car-mount>4. Encased Car Mount</h3><p>Just like a car charger, a car mount is a must-have asset especially when you want to take the help of <a class=link href=https://beebom.com/best-gps-navigation-apps-iphone/ target=_blank rel=noopener>navigation apps</a> to reach your destination.¬† Encased car mount holder has an extremely durable construction and comes with a <strong>secure locking mechanism</strong> to keep your smartphone steady even on a bumpy ride. With three-point adjustability, you can position your Pixel device at the desired angle. Better still, the car mount holder is <strong>case-friendly</strong> so that you don‚Äôt need to remove the cover from your device before mounting it.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Encased-car-mount-holder-.jpg loading=lazy alt="Encased car mount holder"></p><p><em><strong>Buy from Amazon:</strong> <a class=link href=https://geni.us/AAR2 target=_blank rel=noopener>$17.95</a></em></p><h3 id=5-tranmix-power-banks>5. Tranmix Power Banks</h3><p>Never forget to pick up a solid power bank before going for a long journey. With plenty of battery in the tank, it can keep your smartphone powered up so that you can spend less time charging your device and more time on recording awesome videos or snapping memorable pics during a trip. And for this purpose, I think Tranmix power bank is a great option. The <strong>25000mAh battery</strong> along with 4 foldable solar panels up to 6W make it an indispensable travel accessory for your Pixel 4 and 4 XL. What‚Äôs more, the external charger has a rugged design and is also <strong>waterproof</strong>.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tranmix-solar-power-bank-.jpg loading=lazy alt="Tranmix solar power bank"></p><p><em><strong>Buy from Amazon:</strong> <a class=link href=https://geni.us/bAMoj target=_blank rel=noopener>$39.99</a></em></p><h2 id=best-camera-lens-and-selfie-stick-for-pixel-4-and-pixel-4-xl>Best Camera Lens and Selfie Stick for Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL</h2><h3 id=1-moment--superfish-lens>1. Moment ‚Äì Superfish Lens</h3><p>Despite having a square camera bump just like iPhone 11 Pro, Pixel 4 and the bigger sibling 4 XL features only two rear cameras: a 12-megapixel main camera with f/1.7 wide-angle lens and the new f/2.4 ‚Äútelephoto‚Äù camera with a 16-megapixel sensor. What it doesn‚Äôt have is an ultra-wide-angle camera which would have been a great addition. But there is no need to be disappointed as you can fill up the void using <strong>a powerful camera lens</strong> like this one from Moment. The <strong>superfish lens with a 170-degree field of view</strong> can let you capture ultra-wide shots. You can use it to snap the pics of real estate, architecture and action sports. At $99.99, the superfish lens may seem expensive but given quality, it‚Äôs a reasonable deal.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Pixel-4-XL-Lens.jpg loading=lazy alt="Pixel 4 XL Lens Accessory"></p><p><em><strong>Buy from Amazon:</strong> <a class=link href=https://geni.us/JpBbB6Q target=_blank rel=noopener>$99.99</a></em></p><h3 id=2-fugetek-selfie-stick-tripod>2. Fugetek Selfie Stick Tripod</h3><p>Capturing awesome group photos becomes quite easy when you have a selfie stick. And if that stick also doubles as a tripod then you have a perfect accessory for shooting fun-loving videos and amazing photos. If you want an <strong>all-in-one selfie stick</strong> for your new Pixel smartphone, you shouldn‚Äôt look beyond Fugetek. What headlines for this modern-looking selfie stick is the <strong>51‚Ä≥ length</strong> which could be nice for snapping wide-angle pics. The non-skid feet endows it more stability, while the <strong>universal thumbscrew mount</strong> offers desired flexibility. And with the Bluetooth remote at the disposal, it‚Äôs incredibly easy to capture shots ‚Äì without the last moment shakes.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Selfie-Stick-Tripod.jpg loading=lazy alt="Selfie Stick Tripod"></p><p><em><strong>Buy from Amazon:</strong> <a class=link href=https://geni.us/eILHF target=_blank rel=noopener>$23.99</a></em></p><p><strong>SEE ALSO: <a class=link href=https://beebom.com/best-graphene-power-banks/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Best Graphene Power Banks You Can Buy (Continually Updated List)</a></strong></p><h2 id=handpick-the-finest-pixel-4-and-pixel-4-xl-accessories>Handpick the Finest Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL Accessories</h2><p>So, these are our top accessories for the new Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL.
