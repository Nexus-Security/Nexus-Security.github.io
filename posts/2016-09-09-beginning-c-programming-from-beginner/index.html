programming language is often seen as a badge of honor among software developers? C++</p><p>Which programming language can you learn that when added to your resume,¬† will often get you a job interview? C++¬†</p><p>Which programming language is routinely ranked in the top 5 programming languages by popularity, and been consistently in the top 10 for close to 20 years?¬† C++<br>Why you should learn C++<br>Much, if not most of the software written today is still written in C++ and this has been the case for many, many years.</p><p>Not only is C++ popular, but it is also a very relevant language. If you go to GitHub you will see that there are a huge number of active C++ repositories and C++ is also extremely active on stack overflow.</p><p>There are many, many leading software titles written entirely or partly in C++. These include the Windows, Linux and Mac OSX operating systems!</p><p>Many of the Adobe products such as Photoshop and Illustrator,¬† the MySQL and MongoDB database engines, and many many more are written in C++.</p><p>Leading tech companies use C++ for many of their products and internal research and development. These include Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, PayPal, Google, Facebook, Oracle and many more.</p><p>Can you see how learning C++ will open up more career opportunities for you?<br>If more professional companies are using C++, it stands to reason that there is going to be more of a demand for C++ programmers.</p><p>But the main reason programmers should probably learn C++¬† is because it is so powerful!</p><p>What do I mean by powerful?</p><p>C++ is super fast and is a general-purpose programming language that supports both procedure and object-oriented programming making it very flexible.<br>It can scale easily. And it can be portable as well.</p><p>C++ can do many things that other languages just can‚Äôt.</p><p>That‚Äôs why nearly every major language has a way to interface with code written in C++.</p><p>Since C++ has influenced so many languages, if you know C++ you‚Äôll likely see elements from C++ in new languages you learn.<br>How can a beginner learn C++?<br>Frank Mitropolous, the instructor in this course has been using C++ for over 2 decades and has taught students in both university courses and industry training courses.¬† He even worked on a C++ compiler development project while he was in the industry.</p><p>As a result, you can take this course with confidence, knowing that you will learn C++ the right way, and in the shortest possible timeframe.</p><p>Which version of C++ should I learn?</p><p>C++ has had many version releases and updates over the years.¬† It‚Äôs a sad fact that most C++ courses do not teach Modern C++, but focus on old, obsolete versions of C++.</p><p>Frank teaches you Modern C++ (specifically C++ 11 and C++ 14).</p><p>Learn C++ the right way, with Modern C++, as taught by Frank in this course.</p><p>Is C++ difficult to learn?<br>With all the power and flexibility of C++ comes complexity.</p><p>There is no question that C++ is one of the most complex programming languages out there.<br>But with the right instructor and the right training, you really can get up to speed with C++ quickly, and that‚Äôs what this course is all about.</p><p>What will I learn in this course?<br>The course assumes no previous experience with C++ (or even programming in general), and you will end up with the skills to create your programs in C++.</p><p><strong>Key topics covered include.</strong></p><p>* Looping with while, do/while for, range-based for statements and recursion<br>* Performing calculations and displaying results<br>* Functions<br>* Pointers<br>* Using existing classes and creating objects<br>* Creating your classes<br>* Using Basic Standard Template Library classes such as Vector<br>* Constructors and Destructors<br>* Copy and Move semantics including Copy constructors, Move constructors, and copy and move assignment<br>* How to overload operators<br>* Using inheritance and class hierarchies<br>* Using stream I/O<br>* An introduction to the C++ STL<br>* An introduction to Exception Handling<br>* And much more.</p><p><strong>How is this C++ course different from other courses?</strong></p><p>You will learn Modern C++, for one. Many, perhaps most other courses on Udemy teach you old, obsolete versions of C++. If you are going to learn C++, you must learn the Modern version to maximize your career opportunities and to ensure your skills are up to date.<br>The course format includes theory and concepts which are then reinforced with live code examples. Often the C++ debugger is used to step through code and analyze variables to better understand the behavior of C++. The instructor also uses a pen tablet to write on the screen and provide even more visual explanations.</p><p>You won‚Äôt find better C++ training anywhere, and you will struggle to find someone with as much industry and training experience than your instructor Frank has.</p><p>What do I get out of learning C++?</p><p>More career options for one!¬† C++ is one of the most popular programming languages used in game development.¬† ¬† It‚Äôs also heavily used in embedded applications.¬† Your investment in time in learning C++ will reward you time and time again with more pay, and more opportunities, and frankly, more fun!<br>Are you ready to get started?</p><p>If you are ready to get that first paid programming job or to move up to a more senior programming position, then this course is for you!</p><p>Your new job or consulting opportunity awaits!</p><p>Why not get started today?</p><p><strong>Who this course is for:</strong></p><ul><li>This course is perfect for absolute beginners with no previous coding experience, or anyone wanting to add C++ to their existing skillset.</li><li>Anyone looking to increase career options by learning one of the most in-demand programming languages.</li><li>Content From: <a class=link href=https://www.udemy.com/course/beginning-c-plus-plus-programming/ target=_blank rel=noopener>https://www.udemy.com/course/beginning-c-plus-plus-programming/</a></li></ul><p><strong>DOWNLOAD -</strong></p><ul><li><a class=link href=http://gestyy.com/w6E23Y target=_blank rel=noopener>Download Course (size: 7.2GB)</a></li></ul></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-copyright><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="icon icon-tabler icon-tabler-copyright" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="2" stroke="currentcolor" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path stroke="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="9"/><path d="M14.5 9a3.5 4 0 100 6"/></svg><span>Licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</span></section></footer></article><footer class=site-footer><section class=copyright>&copy;
