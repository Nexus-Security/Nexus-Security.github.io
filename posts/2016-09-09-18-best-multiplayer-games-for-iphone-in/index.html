kill a few minutes while youâ€™re waiting in line. But sometimes you want a more significant gaming experience where you can take on your friends, whether theyâ€™re at your house or in a different country. Fortunately, there are a number of great multiplayer games that you can get on your iPhone, from first-person shooters to battle royale to causal racing games. Here are 18 of the best multiplayer games for iPhone to get you started!</p><h2 id=18-great-multiplayer-games-for-iphone>18 Great Multiplayer Games For iPhone</h2><h2 id=casual-multiplayer-games-for-iphone>Casual Multiplayer Games for iPhone</h2><p>Letâ€™s start off the list with some casual games. These are the kind of games you can play in your free time without having to put too much effort on them.</p><h3 id=1-8-ball-pool>1. 8 Ball Pool</h3><p>Miniclipâ€™s 8 Ball Pool is, without a doubt, one of the best multiplayer games for your iPhone. I was introduced to this particular game when I was in high school, and Iâ€™ve been recommending it to everyone since then. 8 Ball Pool has a <strong>simple yet attractive interface</strong> that makes it easy to play.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/8-Ball-Pool-1.jpg loading=lazy alt="8 Ball Pool"></p><p>8 Ball Pool</p><p>Although thereâ€™s an option to play 8 Ball Pool with a guest account, I highly recommend signing via Facebook or Miniclip account to enjoy all the multiplayer features. You can either <strong>play a 1v1 game or challenge your Facebook or 8 Ball Pool friends for a match</strong>. Heck, you can even <strong>play an 8-player tournament to claim your spot in the leaderboards</strong>. Every time you start a new match, you burn some coins and place your bet. The winner, of course, walks away with all the coins.</p><p>If you ever run out of coins to play, you can choose to pick up some coins from the in-game store in exchange for money. You can also use the coins to get cosmetic upgrades, power-ups and more. 8 Ball Pool is available as a free title on the App Store, and I highly recommend you check it out.</p><p><strong>Multiplayer mode:</strong> Online only</p><p><strong>Download 8 Ball Pool (<a class=link href="https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/8-ball-pool/id543186831?mt=8" target=_blank rel=noopener>Free</a>)</strong></p><h3 id=2-bowmasters>2. Bowmasters</h3><p>Bowmasters <strong>is a turn-based game in which you and your opponent will take turns firing arrows at each other.</strong> Youâ€™ll be standing across a stage in varying distances, and your objective is toÂ accurately hit your enemy. Depending on the distance, youâ€™ll have to measure the power and angle of your shot to hit your opponent. I know it sounds like a lot of work, but trust me, youâ€™ll get a hang of the controls in no time.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Bowmasters.jpg loading=lazy alt=Bowmasters></p><p>Bowmasters</p><p>Much like its single-player mode, Bowmastersâ€™ multiplayer mode is also a lot of fun. It is, however, worth pointing out that the multiplayer mode isnâ€™t accessible from the start. Youâ€™ll have to unlock it by getting 10 wins against the AI, which also doubles up as your training period. The <strong>game offers both online and a local multiplayer mode</strong>.</p><p>You can choose to splurge on in-app purchases for both cosmetic and character upgrades, but thatâ€™s entirely optional. You can easily collect the necessary amount of coins and gems by winning battles or watching video ads from time-to-time. Bowmasters is available as a free-to-play game on the App Store, and it is indeed one of the best multiplayer games you can add to your library this year.</p><p><strong>Multiplayer mode:</strong> Play with friends locally or online</p><p><strong>Download Bowmasters (<a class=link href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bowmasters-multiplayer-game/id1118431695?mt=8" target=_blank rel=noopener>Free</a>)</strong></p><h3 id=3-super-stickman-golf-3>3. Super Stickman Golf 3</h3><p>Iâ€™ve always had a special place for games with stick figures, and Super Stickman Golf 3 is one of my favorites. <strong>Super Stickman Golf 3 is the latest in the long-running Stickman series for iPhone,</strong> and as the name suggests, it is a golfing game at its heart. Your objective is to get the ball in the hole. From â€˜Long Hit Ironâ€™ shots to a simple golf drill, you can truly put your golfing skills to work in this game.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Super-Stickman-Golf-3.jpg loading=lazy alt="Super Stickman Golf 3"></p><p>Super Stickman Golf 3</p><p>The gameplay, in case you are wondering, is fairly simple. I love how thereâ€™s no tutorial in this game, and it lets you dive into the game right away. Yes, you can choose to play the single-player mode right away and get started with the game. However, I highly recommend you go for the multiplayer mode as there are two distinct game elements. Thereâ€™s a <strong>race mode</strong> in which you and your opponent will raceÂ to shoot the ball into the hole as fast as possible, and aÂ <strong>â€˜Turn-basedâ€™ mode</strong>, in which you compete against the opponent in a battle that focuses on the score. I personally prefer playing the race mode, because of its competitive nature, but you canâ€™t go wrong either way. The game alsoÂ offers in-app purchases, however, theyâ€™re completely optional. Overall, Super Stickman Golf 3, in my opinion, is one of the best online multiplayer games you can play on your iPhone. Itâ€™s an easy-to-play title that offers pretty much everything you could want from aÂ casual game.</p><p><strong>Multiplayer mode:</strong> Online only</p><p><strong>Download Super Stickman Golf 3 (<a class=link href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/super-stickman-golf-3/id1002132680?mt=8" target=_blank rel=noopener>Free</a>)</strong></p><h2 id=moba-multiplayer-online-battle-arena-games-for-iphone>(MOBA) Multiplayer Online Battle Arena Games for iPhone</h2><p>If you want to get a taste of some intense multiplayer gaming experience, then youâ€™ve got to play some MOBA titles.

Arena of Valor</h3><p>You may have heard of Arena of Valor in the past, as it is one of <strong>the most popular MOBA titles of all times.</strong> The upgraded version of the game <strong>offers 5v5 combat mode</strong> in classic MOBA style, which means your objective is to take down enemy towers. Yes, itâ€™s as good as a MOBA would get on a smartphone.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Arena-of-Valor.jpg loading=lazy alt="Arena of Valor"></p><p>Arena of Valor</p><p><strong>Arena of Valor features over 40Â heroes and a bunch of game modes to choose from.</strong> In addition to the 5V5 mode, you can also choose to play <strong>1v1 or 3v3 mode</strong>. Each match lasts around 10 minutes, so itâ€™s easy to sneak in a game or two between your work. The game also has precision controls, and if youâ€™ve ever played MOBA titles before, then youâ€™ll definitely feel at home with this one. Arena of Valor weighs 1.3GB in size, and it is compatible withÂ iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch running iOSÂ 8.0 or later.</p><p><strong>Multiplayer mode:</strong> Online only</p><p><strong>Download Arena of Valor (</strong><a class=link href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/arena-of-valor/id1150318642?mt=8" target=_blank rel=noopener><strong>Free</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p><h3 id=5-vainglory-5v5>5. Vainglory 5v5</h3><p><strong>Vainglory is a top-tier, action-packed MOBA title.</strong> Thanks to its popularity, it is currently the number one MOBA title on the App Store. Be it <strong>casual, ranked or BRAWL modes</strong>, Vainglory has the perfect gameplay style for you. You also get to choose from <strong>37+ playable heroes</strong> and unlock skins for them.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Vainglory.jpg loading=lazy alt=Vainglory></p><p>Vainglory</p><p>My personal favorite feature of Vainglory is its in-game <strong>Guild finder</strong>, which makes it easier for me to find a game anytime I want. It also has <strong>support for Joystick controls and 120FPS</strong>, which means you are in for an ultimate MOBA experience on a smartphone. Vainglory weighs 2GB in size, and it is compatibleÂ with iPhone XS, X, 8 Plus, iPad, and iPod touch running on iOS 8.0 or above.</p><p><strong>Multiplayer mode:</strong>Â Online mode or join a party with friends</p><p><strong>Download Vainglory 5v5 (<a class=link href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vainglory-5v5/id671464704?mt=8" target=_blank rel=noopener>Free</a>)</strong></p><h2 id=mmorpg-massively-multiplayer-online-role-playing-games-for-iphone>(MMORPG) Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games for iPhone</h2><h3 id=6-adventurequest-3d>6. AdventureQuest 3D</h3><p>AdventureQuest 3D is a relatively new game in the MMORPG space, however, I truly believe that it is worth checking out. At the heart of it,Â AdventureQuest 3D includes all the elements that a mobile MMORPG title would normally have. I am talking about <strong>different game modes like co-op and PvP modes</strong> with cross-platform support. You can also <strong>create your unique hero</strong> and go head-to-head with some of the best MMORPG villains and monsters.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/AdventureQuest-3D.jpg loading=lazy alt="AdventureQuest 3D"></p><p>AdventureQuest 3D</p><p>I also love AdventureQuest 3Dâ€™s Parkour challenge maps. If thatâ€™s not your thing, then <strong>you can also transform into birds, dragons, and more</strong>. Needless to say, the game also offers some interesting modes in which you can raid dungeons or take on boss fight challenges. Despite being a freemium title, AdventureQuest 3D has a lot going for it. <strong>The cross-platform support is truly the highlight feature here for me.</strong> It weighs only 130MB in size, and it is compatible with iPhone, iPads, and iPod Touch running on iOS 8.0 and above.</p><p><strong>Multiplayer mode:</strong> Online mode or join a party with friends</p><p><strong>Download AdventureQuest 3D (<a class=link href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/adventurequest-3d/id968076300?mt=8" target=_blank rel=noopener>Free</a>)</strong></p><h3 id=7-order--chaos-online>7. Order & Chaos Online</h3><p>Order & Chaos Online is one of the most acclaimed MMORPG titles that are available on iOS. The game will take you on an adventure ride with magical creatures in dark forests. You can <strong>choose to be a part of one of the five races, and youâ€™ll find yourself discovering thousands of skills and equipment</strong> throughout your journey.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Order-and-Chaos.jpg loading=lazy alt="Order and Chaos"></p><p>Order and Chaos</p><p><strong>Order & Chaos Online is popularly known for its online community,</strong> in which you can interact with friends and even your enemies. You can also trade or challenge each other, which opens up a ton of opportunities in-game. If youâ€™re planning to play this though, then PvP battlefield areas are the place to be. Itâ€™s a simple game mode in which you try to <strong>capture the opposing teamâ€™s flag and bring it back to your base</strong> to score. Sounds awesome, right? Well, thatâ€™s just a part of the fun, and there are a ton of other things to be explored in this game like quests, dungeons, and more.</p><p><strong>Multiplayer mode:</strong> Online only</p><p><strong>Download Order & Chaos Online (<a class=link href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/order-chaos-online/id414664715?mt=8" target=_blank rel=noopener>Free</a>)</strong></p><h2 id=multiplayer-strategy-games-for-iphone>Multiplayer Strategy Games for iPhone</h2><p>If youâ€™re not into MOBA and MMORPG games, then Iâ€™ve got a couple of strategy games for you as well. Letâ€™s check them out â€“</p><h3 id=8-clash-royale>8. Clash Royale</h3><p>You may have heard of Clash of Clans before. Well, if you have, then youâ€™ve got to introduce yourself to Clash Royale as well. <strong>Clash Royale is a card-based strategy game thatâ€™s inspired from Clash of Clans.</strong> It is all about collecting and upgrading your cards featuring troops, spells, and heroes from Clash of Clans.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Clash-Royale.jpg loading=lazy alt="Clash Royale"></p><p>Clash Royale</p><p><strong>The best part of Clash Royale is the ability to build your own battle community.</strong> Yes, you can build your own community and fight enemies to bring their clans down. Clash Royale is all about teamwork, which makes it one of the best multiplayer games you can add to your library. However, if you like to play as a one-man army, then you can also challenge your friends for a private duel, which is equally fun.</p><p><strong>Multiplayer mode:</strong> Online and private 1v1 duels with friends</p><p><strong>Download Clash Royale (<a class=link href=https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/clash-royale/id1053012308 target=_blank rel=noopener>Free</a>)</strong></p><h3 id=9-star-wars-force-arena>9. Star Wars: Force Arena</h3><p>Star Wars: Force Arena is one of those games that combines the most popular trends in the gaming world into one all-around strategy game. Playing Star Wars: Force Arena makes me feel like I am playing both Clash Royale and Vainglory at the same time. Well, thatâ€™s because this new Star Wars game has borrowed game elements from each of those games.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Star-Wars-Force-Arena.jpg loading=lazy alt="Star Wars Force Arena"></p><p>Star Wars Force Arena</p><p>In Star Wars: Force Arena, you get to <strong>lead your own customized squad and get involved in action-packed gameplay</strong>. The game also has really good graphics, pushing the iPhone to its limits. I also love the gameâ€™s intuitive touch controls as it delivers an ultimate gaming experience. This is a no-brainer for all the Star Wars fans, especially if you liked theÂ latest entry into the franchise, Rogue One.</p><p><strong>Multiplayer mode:</strong> Online only</p><p><strong>Download Star Wars: Force Arena (<a class=link href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/star-wars-force-arena/id1088764761?mt=8" target=_blank rel=noopener>Free</a>)</strong></p><h3 id=10-hearthstone>10. Hearthstone</h3><p>Hearthstone is Blizzardâ€™s award-winning card battler. The game, just like any other card-based strategy games, lets you collect cards and use them to <strong>cast spells and control the battlefield</strong>. You can choose to play a solo mode against AI heroes, however, youâ€™ll have to dive into 1v1 matches against other players online to experience the game to its fullest potential.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Hearthstone.jpg loading=lazy alt=Hearthstone></p><p>Hearthstone</p><p>Building your deck and honing your skills may seem like a lot of work at first. But once you do that and get started with the battles, thereâ€™s hardly anything thatâ€™s going to stop you. Iâ€™ve spent countless hours in this game, and I can confidently say that Hearthstone is indeed one of the best multiplayer games out there. Itâ€™s also a free-to-play title, so be sure to check it out.</p><p><strong>Multiplayer mode:</strong> Online 1v1 or against a friend</p><p><strong>Download Hearthstone (</strong><a class=link href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hearthstone/id625257520?mt=8" target=_blank rel=noopener><strong>Free</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p><h2 id=multiplayer-racing-games-for-iphone>Multiplayer Racing Games for iPhone</h2><p>Appleâ€™s App Store is filled with a ton of awesome racing games, but here are a couple of my favorite ones, which I think deserves a place in your library of games â€“</p><h3 id=11-asphalt-9-legends>11. Asphalt 9 Legends</h3><p>The Asphalt series has some of the best racing games on mobile phones, and Asphalt 9 Legends is no exception. In fact, itâ€™s probably <strong>the best among the Asphalt games</strong>, in my opinion. In addition to career mode, the game also features a ton of unique challenges and limited time events that are a lot of fun to play.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Asphalt-9-Legends.jpg loading=lazy alt="Asphalt 9 Legends"></p><p>Asphalt 9 Legends</p><p>It is also worth pointing out that Asphalt 9 Legends has a great vehicle selection, probably one of the best among all the smartphone racing games out there. Couple that with a robust online multiplayer mode, and you have a winner right here. <strong>The highlight of the game for me is the new â€˜Touch Driveâ€™ button controls.</strong> It makes the game feel a lot better in comparison to other Asphalt games in the series.</p><p><strong>Multiplayer mode:</strong> Online only</p><p><strong>Download Asphalt 9 Legends (<a class=link href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/asphalt-9-legends/id805603214?mt=8" target=_blank rel=noopener>Free</a>)</strong></p><h3 id=12-riptide-gp-renegade>12. Riptide GP: Renegade</h3><p>If you are not into cars, then you must check out Riptide GP: Renegade. As a part of Riptide series, this game lets you ride wave runners instead of cars, and itâ€™s indeed a lot of fun. The game also has gorgeous graphics and unique mechanics that make up for a fun-filled gameplay experience.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Riptide-GP-Renegade.jpg loading=lazy alt="Riptide GP Renegade"></p><p>Riptide GP Renegade</p><p>Riptide GP: Renegadeâ€™s online multiplayer mode is very underrated in my opinion. It lets you <strong>put your skills to test against opponents from around the world in 8-player online matches</strong>. It gets really intense as youâ€™ll be called out forÂ death-defying stunts over massive waterfalls, public waterways, and more. Riptide GP: Renegade is a paid title, however, itâ€™s definitely the bestÂ action-arcade water racer out there, and I highly recommend you give it a shot.</p><p><strong>Multiplayer mode:</strong> Online & split-screen multiplayer mode</p><p><strong>Download Riptide GP: Renegade (</strong><a class=link href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/riptide-gp-renegade/id1090577736?mt=8" target=_blank rel=noopener><strong>$2.99</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p><h2 id=multiplayer-sports-games-for-iphone>Multiplayer Sports Games for iPhone</h2><p>Regardless of the number of games you have on your phone, a game library is always incomplete without some sports games. So here are a couple of multiplayer sports games that are worth checking out â€“</p><h3 id=13-fifa-football>13. FIFA Football</h3><p>Electronic Arts needs no introduction when it comes to sports games, does it? The studio is known for some of the best sports titles on the market, with FIFA being on the top. FIFA on the App Store <strong>offers the most authentic football experience on iOS.</strong> The game features hundreds of licensed teams with thousands of players online.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/FIFA-Mobile-iOS.jpg loading=lazy alt="FIFA Mobile"></p><p>FIFA Footballâ€™s <strong>real-time PvP mode</strong> will put you in a head-to-head battle against the opponents from around the globe. The game also lets you <strong>create your own team, and you can build your roster with players from over 550 real teams</strong>. Heck, you can even tweak tactics of each player before every match. Be it League vs League tournaments or inter-league championships, FIFA Football has a game mode for everyone.</p><p>If you are someone who doesnâ€™t like EAâ€™s FIFA, then you may also want to try Konamiâ€™s Pro Evolution Soccer (PES) 2019 (<a class=link href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pes-2019-pro-evolution-soccer/id1117270703?mt=8" target=_blank rel=noopener>Free</a>).</p><p><strong>Multiplayer mode:</strong> Online and invite-only PvP matches</p><p><strong>Download FIFA Football (<a class=link href="https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/fifa-football/id1094930513?mt=8" target=_blank rel=noopener>Free</a>)</strong></p><h3 id=14-nba-jam>14. NBA JAM</h3><p>BOOMSHAKALAKA! NBA JAM has known to be one of the most popular sports game since the early â€™90s, so I had to add this game to the list of best multiplayer games for iPhone. The game lets you jam with all 30 NBA teams and your favorite NBA stars. <strong>You can unlock some legendary players like Scottie Pippen, Detlef Schrempf, Dennis Rodman, and more.</strong></p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NBA-Jam.jpg loading=lazy alt="NBA Jam"></p><p>NBA Jam</p><p>Although <strong>NBA JAM only has a local multiplayer mode</strong>, I highly recommend you give it a shot. You can also unlock outrageous cheats and go against a friend for a classic arcade battle. The game also offers <strong>two different control schemes like D-Pad or Gesture-based controls</strong>. I personally prefer D-Pad controls, as it gives me the classic arcade vibes, but itâ€™s great that you get the option to choose your own playing style. You should definitely check out NBA JAM.</p><p><strong>Multiplayer mode:</strong> Both online and local multiplayer</p><p><strong>Download NBA JAM (<a class=link href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nba-jam-by-ea-sports/id402370879?mt=8" target=_blank rel=noopener>$4.99</a>)</strong></p><h2 id=multiplayer-simulation-games-for-iphone>Multiplayer Simulation Games for iPhone</h2><h3 id=15-minecraft>15. Minecraft</h3><p>Minecraft is one of the first games that I started my PC gaming journey with, so I had to add it to this list. The mobile version of the game, unlike other mobile ports, is basically the same as the desktop and console versions. In fact, <strong>you can play Minecraft even on servers with people who are playing the game on PC and consoles.</strong></p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Minecraft.jpg loading=lazy alt=Minecraft></p><p>Minecraft</p><p>If youâ€™ve never heard of Minecraft before, <strong>it is a sandbox game where you mine items, destroy them and put on your creative hat.</strong> The game, as you can see, has 8-bit graphics, however, thatâ€™s the Minecraft that Iâ€™ve come to like. So, no complaints there.</p><p>Minecraft also lets you create your own Minecraft Realms, which are your own always-online Minecraft world. You will, however, have to get a monthly subscription, the prices for which depends on the number of people you want to invite to play in your realm simultaneously.</p><p><strong>Multiplayer mode:</strong> Online only</p><p><strong>Download Minecraft (<a class=link href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/minecraft/id479516143?mt=8" target=_blank rel=noopener>Free</a>)</strong></p><h2 id=multiplayer-action-games-for-iphone>Multiplayer Action Games for iPhone</h2><p>Action Games and multiplayer titles are like bread and butter, so thereâ€™s no way I was going to end the list without recommending a few. Here are three action-packed multiplayer games which I think are absolutely worth playing â€“</p><h3 id=16-pubg-mobile>16. PUBG Mobile</h3><p>As I had mentioned earlier, PUBG Mobile has become a household name when it comes to multiplayer games. The game now has a strong community with millions of players across the globe. Each PUBG Mobile game match <strong>starts off in a plane from which you are dropped on an island with up to 99 other players</strong>.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PUBG-Mobile-Desert-Map-3.jpg loading=lazy alt="PUBG Mobile"></p><p>PUBG Mobile</p><p><strong>Your goal is to collect weapons and other supplies, kill the rest of the players and be the last man standing.</strong> You do all that while making sure that you are inside the play area. Well, Iâ€™ve been playing PUBG Mobile since the day it arrived, and I can confidently say that youâ€™ll have a great time battling it out for that Chicken Dinner!</p><p><strong>Multiplayer mode:</strong> Online or play with friends in a private room</p><p><strong>Download PUBG Mobile (<a class=link href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pubg-mobile/id1330123889?mt=8" target=_blank rel=noopener>Free</a>)</strong></p><h3 id=17-fortnite>17. Fortnite</h3><p>If we are talking about PUBG Mobile, thereâ€™s no way we can miss out on its fiercest rival Fortnite. Well, it certainly has taken the game industry by storm and has now become a worldwide phenomenon.Â Itâ€™s an excellent title, where the basics remain the same as any other battle royale game, but the <strong>gameplay here is cartoonish and fun in comparison to PUBG Mobileâ€™s real-life vibe.</strong></p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/fortnite.png loading=lazy alt=fortnite></p><p>Itâ€™s not the quirky gameplay that makes Fortnite so much fun, to be honest, but instead the <strong>building element</strong> that makes fights more interesting. Iâ€™ve been playing Fortnite since it first landed on iOS earlier this year and the game has managed to keep me glued with its interesting stories, outfits, emotes, and all the seasons.</p><p><strong>Multiplayer mode:</strong> Online only</p><p><strong>Download Fortnite (<a class=link href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fortnite/id1261357853?mt=8" target=_blank rel=noopener>Free</a>)</strong></p><h3 id=18-modern-combat-5>18. Modern Combat 5</h3><p>Modern Combat games have always been <strong>considered to be the Call of Duty equivalent games for mobile phones.</strong> Thanks to the fast-paced gameplay, I am a huge fan of the Modern Combat series myself. And much like the previous Modern Combat titles, the new Modern Combat 5 is also equally good if not any better.</p><p><img src=https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Modern-Combat-5.jpg loading=lazy alt="Modern Combat 5"></p><p>Modern Combat 5</p><p>The best part of the game is that it lets you <strong>choose between 9 customizable classes that you can level up</strong> across single and multiplayer modes. You can also activate class-specific skills by burning your skill points.</p><p><strong>The multiplayer mode of Modern Combat 5, in particular, is spectacular.</strong> I find myself coming back to this game just for its epic team clashes. If you are not into those, you can also put your name in the leaderboard by taking on players individually (player vs. squad). The game also offers highly customizable and intuitive controls, making it easier to go on a killing spree.</p><p><strong>Multiplayer mode:</strong> Online and local multiplayer mode over WiFi</p><p><strong>Download Modern Combat 5 (<a class=link href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/modern-combat-5/id656176278?mt=8" target=_blank rel=noopener>Free</a>)</strong></p><p><strong>SEE ALSO:Â <a class=link href=https://beebom.com/useful-iphone-widgets/ target=_blank rel=noopener>10 Useful iPhone Widgets You Should Use</a></strong></p><h2 id=what-are-your-favorite-multiplayer-games>What Are Your Favorite Multiplayer Games?</h2><p>Well, that ends our list of the best multiplayer games for iPhone. PUBG Mobile, Minecraft, and 8 Ball Pool are some of my favorite games, which Iâ€™ve been playing for a long time.
