While twisted pair copper wiring has been the backbone of telecom services since the invention of the telephone, its limitations have become apparent with the demand for higher bandwidths.
Is it possible that copper pair wiring could compete with fiber optic transmission for bandwidths exceeding 1.5 Mbps or support telephone trunks with more than 24 lines? Surprisingly, it can, and the technology is currently available...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/can-copper-really-replace-fiber/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/can-copper-really-replace-fiber/</a></p></description></item><item><title>High Bandwidth Dissimilar Line Bonding From Mushroom Networks</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/high-bandwidth-dissimilar-line-bonding-from-mushroom-networks/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Oct 2023 18:19:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/high-bandwidth-dissimilar-line-bonding-from-mushroom-networks/</guid><description>Want to create your own high-bandwidth internet connection without the exorbitant cost of dedicated services like SONET OC3? Combining consumer-grade options like DSL, cable, or wireless might seem appealing, but achieving a reliable, high-speed connection this way is practically impossible with standard routers.
Instead of another router, consider the Truffles appliance from Mushroom Networks. This innovative device combines multiple internet connections, regardless of type, into a single, high-bandwidth connection.
While traditional &amp;ldquo;T1 bonding&amp;rdquo; offered by carriers has limitations in terms of speed and requiring identical lines from a single provider, Truffles takes a different approach...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/high-bandwidth-dissimilar-line-bonding-from-mushroom-networks/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/high-bandwidth-dissimilar-line-bonding-from-mushroom-networks/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Ethernet over Copper Distance Sensitivity</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-over-copper-distance-sensitivity/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Aug 2023 04:27:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-over-copper-distance-sensitivity/</guid><description>The arrival of Ethernet over Copper (EoC) offers businesses a range of bandwidth options previously unavailable without fiber optic connections. EoC surpasses the speed limits of traditional T1 lines, provides easy scalability, and often comes at a lower price point, making it an attractive option for businesses seeking robust internet solutions.
However, a few limitations hinder the widespread use of EoC. Firstly, it requires compatible equipment at the telephone company&amp;rsquo;s central office (CO), where your copper lines terminate...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-over-copper-distance-sensitivity/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-over-copper-distance-sensitivity/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Point to Point Dedicated T1</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/point-to-point-dedicated-t1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Aug 2023 20:13:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/point-to-point-dedicated-t1/</guid><description>Although a traditional service, point-to-point dedicated T1 lines remain popular. This article examines their functionality and applications.
](http://www.t1t3today.com/) Initially designed for internal use, telephone companies used T1 lines to combine 24 individual analog phone lines into a single digital connection. Their key characteristics included serial digital transmission via a maximum of two twisted pair wires, regeneration to extend transmission distance, fixed private connections between two points, a multiplexing method to separate concurrent calls, and a 1...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/point-to-point-dedicated-t1/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/point-to-point-dedicated-t1/</a></p></description></item><item><title> When Only T1 Will Do</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/-when-only-t1-will-do/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jun 2023 10:17:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/-when-only-t1-will-do/</guid><description>By: John Shepler
While gigabit fiber connections are becoming the norm, T1 lines are still a relevant and useful option for bandwidth needs. T1 service remains popular and could be a perfect fit for your requirements, balancing speed and affordability.
Why Consider T1 Lines?
T1 is a well-established and widely available telecom service. Although Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) was once the standard, it&amp;rsquo;s being replaced by VoIP and cloud-based systems in many businesses...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/-when-only-t1-will-do/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/-when-only-t1-will-do/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Covad and ADTRAN Make Everything Ethernet</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/covad-and-adtran-make-everything-ethernet/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Apr 2023 09:47:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/covad-and-adtran-make-everything-ethernet/</guid><description>The arrival of Carrier Ethernet is generating considerable excitement around IP core networks and Ethernet access solutions. However, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean traditional TDM services are obsolete. DS1 and DS3 circuits can be adapted for Ethernet transport with the right equipment, as demonstrated by Carrier Covad and equipment manufacturer ADTRAN.
Covad is expanding its Ethernet service area using ADTRAN&amp;rsquo;s central office and network termination equipment. With a nationwide core network, Covad serves 44 states and 235 major markets, specializing in business DSL, data T1, fixed wireless, bonded T1, and integrated voice and data solutions...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/covad-and-adtran-make-everything-ethernet/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/covad-and-adtran-make-everything-ethernet/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Increasing T1 Speed</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/increasing-t1-speed/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Dec 2022 15:37:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/increasing-t1-speed/</guid><description>For decades, T1 lines have been the standard for business network connections, offering ample bandwidth initially. However, like computer advancements, what was sufficient before is now inadequate. While upgrading to fiber is an option, it&amp;rsquo;s not the only solution.
Many companies opt for the traditional upgrade path from T1 (1.5 Mbps) to T3 (45 Mbps) speeds. This offers a significant speed increase at a premium, though T3 costs have decreased...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/increasing-t1-speed/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/increasing-t1-speed/</a></p></description></item><item><title>EoC Takes On Fractional DS3</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/eoc-takes-on-fractional-ds3/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Oct 2022 16:42:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/eoc-takes-on-fractional-ds3/</guid><description>Prior to the widespread adoption of Carrier Ethernet, businesses seeking increased bandwidth from T1 lines faced two primary options: upgrading to T3/DS3 for a substantial leap in capacity, or incrementally combining multiple T1 lines through bonding. However, the emergence of Ethernet over Copper (EoC) presents a compelling alternative for dedicated bandwidth.
