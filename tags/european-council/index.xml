Election laws typically set the stage but don&amp;rsquo;t directly determine the winner, although there are notable exceptions like the 2000 US election.
The 2014 Commission President election is unique because the rules changed, and their interpretation is debated. Previously, the European Council appointed the President after European Parliament approval. The Treaty of Lisbon introduced new rules, applied for the first time, stating the Parliament &amp;ldquo;elects&amp;rdquo; the President based on the Council&amp;rsquo;s nomination, &amp;ldquo;taking account&amp;rdquo; of Parliament election results...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-appropriate-for-the-outcome-of-the-european-parliament-elections-to-dictate-the-selection-of-the-next-president-of-the-european-commission-or-are-there-valid-concerns-about-this-democratic-process/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-appropriate-for-the-outcome-of-the-european-parliament-elections-to-dictate-the-selection-of-the-next-president-of-the-european-commission-or-are-there-valid-concerns-about-this-democratic-process/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The ECJ has upheld the EU law on relocating asylum-seekers, but some question if it is a Pyrrhic victory.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-ecj-has-upheld-the-eu-law-on-relocating-asylum-seekers-but-some-question-if-it-is-a-pyrrhic-victory/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2024 22:30:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-ecj-has-upheld-the-eu-law-on-relocating-asylum-seekers-but-some-question-if-it-is-a-pyrrhic-victory/</guid><description>The EU Court Rules on Refugee Relocation: A Pyrrhic Victory? Professor Steve Peers examines the European Court of Justice&amp;rsquo;s (ECJ) decision regarding the mandatory relocation of asylum-seekers, highlighting the complex interplay between legal effectiveness and political realities.
In 2015, facing a significant influx of asylum-seekers, the EU implemented a measure requiring member states to relocate 160,000 individuals from overburdened Italy and Greece. This decision faced resistance, particularly a legal challenge from Slovakia and Hungary, questioning its legal basis and practicality...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-ecj-has-upheld-the-eu-law-on-relocating-asylum-seekers-but-some-question-if-it-is-a-pyrrhic-victory/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-ecj-has-upheld-the-eu-law-on-relocating-asylum-seekers-but-some-question-if-it-is-a-pyrrhic-victory/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The Legal Implications of Extending EU Membership and Brexit</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-legal-implications-of-extending-eu-membership-and-brexit/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 14:58:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-legal-implications-of-extending-eu-membership-and-brexit/</guid><description>Professor Steve Peers, University of Essex*
*This blog post was updated after the official decision extending EU membership was approved.
With the Brexit deadline of March 29th approaching and no approval for the proposed withdrawal agreement, the European Council convened and agreed to extend the UK&amp;rsquo;s EU membership on March 21st. The UK formally accepted the extension on March 22nd. This raises several legal questions regarding extending EU membership...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-legal-implications-of-extending-eu-membership-and-brexit/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-legal-implications-of-extending-eu-membership-and-brexit/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Comments on the outcomes of the most recent European Council meeting regarding EU migration policy.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/comments-on-the-outcomes-of-the-most-recent-european-council-meeting-regarding-eu-migration-policy/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 May 2023 06:13:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/comments-on-the-outcomes-of-the-most-recent-european-council-meeting-regarding-eu-migration-policy/</guid><description>Steve Peers
The EU faces another crisis alongside &amp;ldquo;Grexit&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Brexit&amp;rdquo;: a surge in immigration. Initial EU responses culminated in an emergency summit in April. I previously discussed the outcomes of that summit. Subsequently, the Commission released its EU migration &amp;ldquo;Agenda&amp;rdquo; in mid-May, followed by detailed proposals. Last week, the European Council revisited immigration, reaching several conclusions. This post outlines those conclusions and offers my commentary. The third part of the conclusions, which vaguely promises increased cooperation with third countries, is omitted...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/comments-on-the-outcomes-of-the-most-recent-european-council-meeting-regarding-eu-migration-policy/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/comments-on-the-outcomes-of-the-most-recent-european-council-meeting-regarding-eu-migration-policy/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
