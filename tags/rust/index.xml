The older plugs, often corroded, benefit from the upgrade. This particular Beogram 4000 was no exception.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a comparison of the old plug and the new, gleaming Neutrik plug (Newark 27B4483):
The old plug was removed, and the cable was prepped for the new plug. Stripping the outer insulation to this length works well:..<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-installation-of-a-neutrik-gold-plated-din5-plug/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-installation-of-a-neutrik-gold-plated-din5-plug/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002: From Oil Cleanup to First Operational Test</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-from-oil-cleanup-to-first-operational-test/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2024 23:30:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-from-oil-cleanup-to-first-operational-test/</guid><description>The Beogram 4002 restoration hit a snag. Although the main board was restored, the presence of rust and corrosion discovered earlier took priority. Addressing rust requires applying neutralizer and paint, which involves drying time between coats, thus delaying the planned reservoir capacitor and output board work.
Images highlighting the most severe rust spots are included.
Despite the significant rust, the turntable&amp;rsquo;s overall condition is good. To combat the rust, three coats of rust neutralizer were applied...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-from-oil-cleanup-to-first-operational-test/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-from-oil-cleanup-to-first-operational-test/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002: New Project From Houston</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-new-project-from-houston/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Mar 2023 16:16:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-new-project-from-houston/</guid><description>My next project takes me away from Beomaster restorations and back to Beogram turntables. It&amp;rsquo;s great to work on both, so I&amp;rsquo;m excited regardless. A gentleman from Houston entrusted me with two Beogram 4002 Type 5513 turntables he acquired some years ago. As time took its toll, they stopped functioning properly.Â Like many Beogram 4002 owners, he realized he missed listening to his vinyl records and decided to have them restored...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-new-project-from-houston/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-new-project-from-houston/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
