To determine which candidates best serve your interests, we suggest considering MPLS and Ethernet for reliable bandwidth, improved performance, and reduced costs over 1-3 years. Let&amp;rsquo;s delve into their platforms to see if they deserve your vote.
IP Networking is currently the leading technology. Initially confined to local offices, IP has expanded to WANs at state, regional, and national levels. Today, almost all network designs are centered around IP or Internet Protocol.</description></item><item><title>Is it appropriate for the outcome of the European Parliament elections to dictate the selection of the next President of the European Commission, or are there valid concerns about this democratic process?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-appropriate-for-the-outcome-of-the-european-parliament-elections-to-dictate-the-selection-of-the-next-president-of-the-european-commission-or-are-there-valid-concerns-about-this-democratic-process/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2024 21:55:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-appropriate-for-the-outcome-of-the-european-parliament-elections-to-dictate-the-selection-of-the-next-president-of-the-european-commission-or-are-there-valid-concerns-about-this-democratic-process/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s doubtful the European Court of Justice will decide the next European Commission President. Election laws typically set the stage but don&amp;rsquo;t directly determine the winner, although there are notable exceptions like the 2000 US election.
The 2014 Commission President election is unique because the rules changed, and their interpretation is debated. Previously, the European Council appointed the President after European Parliament approval. The Treaty of Lisbon introduced new rules, applied for the first time, stating the Parliament &amp;ldquo;elects&amp;rdquo; the President based on the Council&amp;rsquo;s nomination, &amp;ldquo;taking account&amp;rdquo; of Parliament election results.</description></item><item><title>Could Data Protection be Returning Home?

Imagine you&amp;rsquo;re showering when the doorbell unexpectedly interrupts. Hoping it&amp;rsquo;s the anticipated Amazon delivery with a birthday gift for your daughter, you rush downstairs, only to find a pair of Jehovah&amp;rsquo;s Witnesses.
After dismissing their pleas, you close the door, putting the encounter out of your mind. However, they haven&amp;rsquo;t forgotten you. To maintain their focus on potential converts, they keep records of visited homes, categorizing residents as &amp;ldquo;Believer,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Unbeliever,&amp;rdquo; or perhaps even &amp;ldquo;Satanist,&amp;rdquo; depending on your towel situation.</description></item><item><title>Prisoner voting is now a legal issue under EU legislation.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/prisoner-voting-is-now-a-legal-issue-under-eu-legislation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2024 05:28:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/prisoner-voting-is-now-a-legal-issue-under-eu-legislation/</guid><description>Jo Shaw, Salvesen Chair of European Institutions
Article 39(2) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights states:
‘European Parliament members shall be chosen through direct, universal suffrage in a free and secret ballot.’
The Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice, in a concise and understated judgment in Delvigne (Case C-650/13; ECLI:EU:C:2015:648) delivered on October 6, 2015, provided further definition to this provision. It found that national policies determining voter eligibility in European Parliament elections fall under EU law&amp;rsquo;s purview, as they implement EU law according to Article 51(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</description></item><item><title>The Failed Gamble: Brexit Election aftermath and the future steps</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-failed-gamble-brexit-election-aftermath-and-the-future-steps/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Nov 2023 05:04:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-failed-gamble-brexit-election-aftermath-and-the-future-steps/</guid><description>Professor Steve Peers
The recent UK election concluded with an unexpected &amp;lsquo;hung Parliament,&amp;rsquo; where no single party secured a majority in the House of Commons. This raises questions about the future of Brexit.
Theresa May&amp;rsquo;s Conservative party undeniably faced a major setback. The Prime Minister called for this election three years ahead of schedule, seeking a stronger majority to solidify her Brexit plan. Instead, voters reduced her majority, resulting in a minority government.</description></item><item><title>Comparing and evaluating the immigration policy proposals of candidates for Commission President.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/comparing-and-evaluating-the-immigration-policy-proposals-of-candidates-for-commission-president/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Oct 2023 12:59:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/comparing-and-evaluating-the-immigration-policy-proposals-of-candidates-for-commission-president/</guid><description>Steve Peers
Much like fans of Fantasy Football, European Union politics enthusiasts can engage in a similar thought experiment: envisioning the potential impact of different candidates for Commission President if they were elected.
It&amp;rsquo;s important to remember that the European Council&amp;rsquo;s willingness to nominate the candidate from the leading political party after the May 25th elections remains uncertain. Additionally, the European Parliament&amp;rsquo;s reaction to a nomination they disagree with is unclear, despite having the power to elect the President.</description></item><item><title>Is it fair for EU citizens who relocate to still have the right to vote in their home country?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-fair-for-eu-citizens-who-relocate-to-still-have-the-right-to-vote-in-their-home-country/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Aug 2023 02:40:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-fair-for-eu-citizens-who-relocate-to-still-have-the-right-to-vote-in-their-home-country/</guid><description>Steve Peers
The European Commission recently issued a communication and recommendation addressing the loss of voting rights for EU citizens who relocate to other Member States. The Commission acknowledges that national identity grants Member States the right to determine voter eligibility. However, they urge Member States to consider if their policies on disenfranchisement hinder political participation. The Commission argues that many citizens maintain an interest in their home country&amp;rsquo;s politics, staying informed about political developments is easier than ever, and there&amp;rsquo;s a growing trend towards allowing expatriates to vote.</description></item><item><title>Is Juncker capable of being a reformist Commission President, like Nixon was in going to China?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-juncker-capable-of-being-a-reformist-commission-president-like-nixon-was-in-going-to-china/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Feb 2023 22:41:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-juncker-capable-of-being-a-reformist-commission-president-like-nixon-was-in-going-to-china/</guid><description>Steve Peers
A common saying in American politics, &amp;ldquo;only Nixon could go to China,&amp;rdquo; suggests that only a politician with a well-established reputation can persuade their base to accept a major policy shift. Nixon, a staunch anti-Communist, was able to convince American conservatives that engaging with Communist China was in their best interest. This principle might apply to the European Union as well. The recent European Parliament (EP) elections saw a rise in support for anti-EU parties in several Member States.</description></item><item><title>If the UK remains a member of the EU past May 22nd, it will be necessary for the country to hold European Parliament elections in order to uphold democratic principles.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/if-the-uk-remains-a-member-of-the-eu-past-may-22nd-it-will-be-necessary-for-the-country-to-hold-european-parliament-elections-in-order-to-uphold-democratic-principles/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Dec 2022 04:35:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/if-the-uk-remains-a-member-of-the-eu-past-may-22nd-it-will-be-necessary-for-the-country-to-hold-european-parliament-elections-in-order-to-uphold-democratic-principles/</guid><description>Professor Eleanor Spaventa, Bocconi University
The UK&amp;rsquo;s political climate surrounding Brexit is highly unstable. Prime Minister May&amp;rsquo;s strategy of delaying a decision may or may not work, but it seems to have created a situation where extending Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union is unavoidable. If Parliament approves the Withdrawal Agreement this week, the UK will need more time to implement the necessary legislation before leaving the EU.</description></item><item><title>It's finally here - the CJEU has confirmed that UK citizens have officially lost their EU citizenship.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/it-s-finally-here-the-cjeu-has-confirmed-that-uk-citizens-have-officially-lost-their-eu-citizenship/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Aug 2022 15:41:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/it-s-finally-here-the-cjeu-has-confirmed-that-uk-citizens-have-officially-lost-their-eu-citizenship/</guid><description>Professor Steve Peers, University of Essex
The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has affirmed that UK citizens lost EU citizenship due to Brexit, as per a recent judgment. This aligns with the earlier Advocate-General’s opinion. While other similar cases exist, the CJEU is unlikely to deviate from this decision.
This judgment is notable for its dismissal of arguments advocating for the retention of EU citizenship for British citizens, marking a significant shift.</description></item><item><title>Extension and elections: It is important to discuss Article 50.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/extension-and-elections-it-is-important-to-discuss-article-50/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jul 2022 03:00:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/extension-and-elections-it-is-important-to-discuss-article-50/</guid><description>Professors Catherine Barnard (University of Cambridge) and Steve Weatherill (University of Oxford) explore the implications of Article 50, the exit clause for leaving the European Union. While brief and seemingly straightforward, Article 50 leaves much open to interpretation.
The authors begin by outlining the process for extending the two-year withdrawal period, noting that an extension would require unanimous agreement from all EU member states. They suggest that an extension is likely to be granted if requested by the UK, as it would provide additional time for the UK to either pass the necessary legislation to implement the Withdrawal Agreement or prepare for a &amp;ldquo;no-deal&amp;rdquo; Brexit.</description></item><item><title>Overview of the European Democracy Action Plan</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/overview-of-the-european-democracy-action-plan/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Jul 2022 04:55:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/overview-of-the-european-democracy-action-plan/</guid><description>Professor Lorna Woods, University of Essex
The European Democracy Action Plan (EDAP) is one piece of a larger effort to regulate the online world. Unveiled as a key initiative by Commission President von der Leyen, it joins upcoming legislation like the Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA). These measures signal a change in how the EU approaches internet regulation and raise questions about the EU&amp;rsquo;s authority in this space.</description></item><item><title>Can a person be a member of both a national parliament and the European Parliament at the same time?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/can-a-person-be-a-member-of-both-a-national-parliament-and-the-european-parliament-at-the-same-time/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jun 2022 13:03:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/can-a-person-be-a-member-of-both-a-national-parliament-and-the-european-parliament-at-the-same-time/</guid><description>Steve Peers
Recently, Geert Wilders, the leader of the Dutch PVV party and a newly elected Member of the European Parliament (MEP), declared his intent to pursue legal action to maintain his position as both an MEP and a member of the Dutch national parliament. This begs the question: does such a right exist?
The crux of the matter lies in Article 39 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, which states that every EU citizen possesses the right to vote in and stand as a candidate for European Parliament elections.</description></item></channel></rss>
