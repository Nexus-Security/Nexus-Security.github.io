While outsourcing IT applications to the cloud is increasingly popular, the importance of a strong cloud connection is often overlooked. People assume that since the data center has abundant connectivity, their connection doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. But how you connect to the cloud significantly impacts performance.
The Difference Between LAN and WAN Think about your current in-house network. It&amp;rsquo;s likely fast and reliable because everything connects through the company LAN with standard Ethernet connections...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-office-to-data-center-connection/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-office-to-data-center-connection/</a></p></description></item><item><title>1000 Mbps SONET or Gigabit Ethernet Options</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/1000-mbps-sonet-or-gigabit-ethernet-options/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jul 2023 00:18:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/1000-mbps-sonet-or-gigabit-ethernet-options/</guid><description>With growing bandwidth demands, businesses are turning to WAN network speeds that were once impractical. The competition within the bandwidth market has made 1,000 Mbps or Gigabit Ethernet (GigE) more affordable than one might expect. The cost per Mbps has dropped significantly in recent years, while availability has increased.
This is beneficial for businesses adopting cloud computing or those with substantial bandwidth requirements, such as medical facilities, content creators and distributors, and Internet service providers...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/1000-mbps-sonet-or-gigabit-ethernet-options/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/1000-mbps-sonet-or-gigabit-ethernet-options/</a></p></description></item><item><title>10 Mbps Fiber Offers Future Growth</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/10-mbps-fiber-offers-future-growth/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jun 2023 15:41:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/10-mbps-fiber-offers-future-growth/</guid><description>By: John Shepler
Insufficient bandwidth severely hinders productivity and increases stress levels. Slow loading times for websites, cloud documents, and collaborative platforms, as well as choppy video calls, are just a few of the frustrations. Increased processing power or RAM won&amp;rsquo;t solve this; the only solution is greater network bandwidth.
What Bandwidth Should You Aim For? The required bandwidth varies depending on your usage patterns and the quality of bandwidth you&amp;rsquo;re using...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/10-mbps-fiber-offers-future-growth/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/10-mbps-fiber-offers-future-growth/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Ethernet Fiber Replaces Bonded T1</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-fiber-replaces-bonded-t1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Nov 2022 02:23:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-fiber-replaces-bonded-t1/</guid><description>By: John Shepler
T1 lines have been a popular connectivity solution for businesses for many years due to their reliability and flexibility in private lines, dedicated internet access, and telephone trunking. However, with the increasing demands of cloud applications and HD video, the fixed bandwidth of 1.5 Mbps has become a significant limitation.
Solution #1: Bonded T1 Lines
One way to increase bandwidth is to combine multiple T1 lines. This can be achieved using a WAN aggregation device or by ordering bonded T1 lines from a provider...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-fiber-replaces-bonded-t1/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-fiber-replaces-bonded-t1/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
