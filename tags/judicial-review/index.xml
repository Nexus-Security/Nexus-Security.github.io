This conclusion from the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) comes from its judgment in the I. &amp;amp; S. case.

This directive, formally known as Directive 2008/115/EC, establishes common standards for EU Member States regarding the return of illegally staying third-country nationals.

This is based on the Sharpston-Council orders (cases C-684/20P and C-685/20P), which deemed the former British Advocate Generalâ€™s challenge against a new AG appointment inadmissible, and Advocate General Bobek&amp;rsquo;s opinion in joined cases concerning the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the European Labour Authority (ELA) (cases C-59/18, C-182/18, and C-743/19, and in a parallel opinion in Cases C-106/19 and 232/19)...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/do-member-states-have-the-authority-to-make-decisions-that-are-above-the-law-is-it-possible-to-challenge-member-states-decisions-regarding-the-locations-of-eu-agencies/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/do-member-states-have-the-authority-to-make-decisions-that-are-above-the-law-is-it-possible-to-challenge-member-states-decisions-regarding-the-locations-of-eu-agencies/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
