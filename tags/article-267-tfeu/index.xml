As the deadline for Brexit approaches and Theresa May&amp;rsquo;s conflicting negotiating goals become clearer, there are increasing demands for transparency regarding the Brexit process.
In late 2017, seven Scottish politicians from different parties and legislative bodies in Scotland (the Scottish Parliament, the UK Parliament, and the European Parliament) initiated a legal case in the Scottish Court of Session...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/putting-an-end-to-brexit-explaining-the-wightman-case-on-reversing-the-article-50-notification-independently/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/putting-an-end-to-brexit-explaining-the-wightman-case-on-reversing-the-article-50-notification-independently/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The CJEU clarifies CILFIT regarding the final courts' obligations to refer questions.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-clarifies-cilfit-regarding-the-final-courts-obligations-to-refer-questions/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jan 2024 19:34:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-clarifies-cilfit-regarding-the-final-courts-obligations-to-refer-questions/</guid><description>Daniel Sarmiento, Professor of EU Law at the University Complutense of Madrid*
In a previous post, I argued that the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) held national supreme courts to a higher standard than the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) regarding preliminary references to the CJEU. I suggested this was due to the CJEU&amp;rsquo;s ruling in the CILFIT case. However, the CJEU has recently proven me wrong...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-clarifies-cilfit-regarding-the-final-courts-obligations-to-refer-questions/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-clarifies-cilfit-regarding-the-final-courts-obligations-to-refer-questions/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The Court of Justice of the European Union will soon examine important legal matters related to EU sanctions against non-EU countries.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-court-of-justice-of-the-european-union-will-soon-examine-important-legal-matters-related-to-eu-sanctions-against-non-eu-countries/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Oct 2023 14:46:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-court-of-justice-of-the-european-union-will-soon-examine-important-legal-matters-related-to-eu-sanctions-against-non-eu-countries/</guid><description>Stian Øby Johansen, PhD fellow at the University of Oslo Faculty of Law*
I recently attended a hearing at the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) concerning a case brought by Russian energy company Rosneft against EU sanctions imposed after Russia&amp;rsquo;s intervention in Crimea.

The connection between arbitral tribunals and the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has been a source of legal debate for many years. While the present situation is straightforward and practical, it is not without controversy. Commercial arbitration tribunals are not seen as &amp;ldquo;courts or tribunals of a Member State&amp;rdquo; as defined by Article 267 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-luxembourg-court-providing-assistance-in-preliminary-references-and-investment-tribunals/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-luxembourg-court-providing-assistance-in-preliminary-references-and-investment-tribunals/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The Role of Non-Legal Stability Factors in Ensuring Legal Certainty in the Preliminary Reference Procedure (Elgar 2022)</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-role-of-non-legal-stability-factors-in-ensuring-legal-certainty-in-the-preliminary-reference-procedure-elgar-2022/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jun 2023 04:32:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-role-of-non-legal-stability-factors-in-ensuring-legal-certainty-in-the-preliminary-reference-procedure-elgar-2022/</guid><description>John Cotter, Lecturer in Law, School of Law, Keele University
A common saying, often credited to Benjamin Franklin, states that only death and taxes are inevitable. If we interpret &amp;ldquo;certainty&amp;rdquo; literally, legal professionals trying to anticipate the results of a case might concur. Predicting court outcomes involves significant challenges. Some stem from ambiguity within legal rules themselves, stemming from the limits of language in conveying meaning (&amp;ldquo;legal obstacles&amp;rdquo;). Others arise from external factors that influence how rules are selected, interpreted, and applied to a case (&amp;ldquo;extra-legal obstacles&amp;rdquo;)...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-role-of-non-legal-stability-factors-in-ensuring-legal-certainty-in-the-preliminary-reference-procedure-elgar-2022/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-role-of-non-legal-stability-factors-in-ensuring-legal-certainty-in-the-preliminary-reference-procedure-elgar-2022/</a></p></description></item><item><title>What authority should the Court of Justice have in EU Foreign Policy?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-authority-should-the-court-of-justice-have-in-eu-foreign-policy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Nov 2022 10:42:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-authority-should-the-court-of-justice-have-in-eu-foreign-policy/</guid><description>Luigi Lonardo, PhD student, King’s College London
Article 24(1) of the Treaty on the European Union states that the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) operates under distinct rules and procedures, explicitly stating that the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) holds no jurisdiction over these provisions.
Legal experts are debating whether &amp;ldquo;the CJEU shall not have jurisdiction&amp;rdquo; implies a degree of jurisdiction. AG Wahl articulated this question: Does the exclusion of CJEU jurisdiction encompass all CFSP actions or only specific categories?..<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-authority-should-the-court-of-justice-have-in-eu-foreign-policy/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-authority-should-the-court-of-justice-have-in-eu-foreign-policy/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Commentary on Arlewin v.

The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) ruling of March 1, 2016, in the case of Arlewin v. Sweden examined how EU Regulation 44/2001, which decides which Member State&amp;rsquo;s courts hold jurisdiction over civil and commercial disputes, was used (or misused) by Swedish courts. This case highlighted the limitations of the &amp;lsquo;acte clair&amp;rsquo; doctrine – the idea that national courts don&amp;rsquo;t always need to consult the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on EU law matters...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/commentary-on-arlewin-v-sweden-libel-law-eu-law-and-the-echr/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/commentary-on-arlewin-v-sweden-libel-law-eu-law-and-the-echr/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
