If so, a computer designed for mobility might be perfect for you, like one of the new netbooks with built-in 3G cellular internet access.
You might be thinking laptops aren&amp;rsquo;t that bulky and work fine at a coffee shop.
That&amp;rsquo;s true. A laptop with a wireless modem aircard would be comparable to a netbook in functionality. However, laptops are heavier and often carry unnecessary extras.</description></item><item><title>What is 4G and Why Do You Want It?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-is-4g-and-why-do-you-want-it/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2024 05:55:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-is-4g-and-why-do-you-want-it/</guid><description>You&amp;rsquo;re constantly bombarded with ads for 3G phones and wireless aircards, and now 4G is emerging. But what does this new technology mean and why should you care?
2G, 3G, 4Gâ€”these &amp;ldquo;Gs&amp;rdquo; represent different generations of wireless broadband. This technology evolves so rapidly that various generations often coexist in the same region. This is intentional. If you&amp;rsquo;re in an area with weak 3G coverage, your device automatically connects to slower 2.</description></item><item><title>Internet Soothes The Savage Beasts</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/internet-soothes-the-savage-beasts/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Nov 2023 22:21:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/internet-soothes-the-savage-beasts/</guid><description>Instead of resorting to strict discipline, a school in Vail, Arizona, found a simple solution to improve student behavior on their buses: providing Wi-Fi access. Surprisingly, once installed, disruptive behavior vanished, and students became more engaged in their homework.
This success story highlights a key point: providing Internet access can effectively address disciplinary issues. While students may engage in various online activities, the core issue of maintaining order is resolved.</description></item><item><title>Can You Get To The Cloud?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/can-you-get-to-the-cloud/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Oct 2023 03:10:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/can-you-get-to-the-cloud/</guid><description>Cloud computing and storage are becoming increasingly popular, and many believe they will soon be the standard for computer use. There are many benefits to using the cloud, such as not needing to buy or maintain software, having data automatically backed up, accessing tools and data from anywhere on any device, and being able to use smaller, more portable computers, like netbooks, cellphones, and tablets. However, one concern remains: reliable access to the cloud.</description></item><item><title>4G Wireless Quietly Encroaching on 3G</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/4g-wireless-quietly-encroaching-on-3g/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Sep 2023 23:47:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/4g-wireless-quietly-encroaching-on-3g/</guid><description>Cellular companies are promoting 3G wireless technology as the most advanced available. However, a faster technology called 4G is being gradually introduced across the country. This situation reflects the typical progression of technology, where an invention like wireless data service undergoes continuous advancements. Like early personal computers compared to today&amp;rsquo;s models, mobile data is following a similar path of growth.
Cellular carriers dominate wide-area mobile service due to their extensive network infrastructure.</description></item><item><title>Business DSL Alternatives</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/business-dsl-alternatives/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Aug 2023 18:38:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/business-dsl-alternatives/</guid><description>Small businesses have favored Business DSL due to its accessibility and affordability. While effective for some, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t suit all businesses, with some completely unable to access it. Here&amp;rsquo;s a breakdown of Business DSL and alternative options for companies dissatisfied with its performance or availability.

Similar to residential DSL, Business DSL uses existing telephone wiring, usually a single pair, owned by the telephone company. This means your telephone company is the sole provider, though they may lease lines to other companies offering similar services.</description></item><item><title>The Next Decade of Bandwidth - Part III</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-next-decade-of-bandwidth-part-iii/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jul 2023 04:36:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-next-decade-of-bandwidth-part-iii/</guid><description>A significant disagreement is occurring regarding the allocation of the electromagnetic spectrum. Wireless carriers and broadcasters, alongside government entities and satellite providers, are vying for their share. However, the spectrum is a finite resource. Although market forces like auctions and sales play a role, innovative solutions are crucial for optimizing spectrum utilization.
One such innovation, inspired by the concept of &amp;ldquo;white space&amp;rdquo; in printing, targets unused portions of the spectrum. Just as blank areas exist on a printed page, gaps remain between allocated TV channels.</description></item><item><title>Is Dial-Up Internet Doomed?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-dial-up-internet-doomed/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jul 2023 08:41:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-dial-up-internet-doomed/</guid><description>Dial-up internet, once the king of online connectivity, is facing an uncertain future in a world dominated by broadband. With various technologies like WiFi, DSL, satellite, cable, fiber, and cellular competing for users, the relevance of the once-groundbreaking 56K dial-up is questionable.
It might be surprising to learn that millions of people in the U.S. still use dial-up. These users fall into two groups: those who would switch to broadband if it were affordable and those who use the internet so infrequently that they prefer a free option.</description></item><item><title>T-Mobile 3G Aircard For PC and Mac</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/t-mobile-3g-aircard-for-pc-and-mac/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Nov 2022 08:32:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/t-mobile-3g-aircard-for-pc-and-mac/</guid><description>Want to connect your laptop to T-Mobile&amp;rsquo;s 3G network and get free access to their HotSpots?
