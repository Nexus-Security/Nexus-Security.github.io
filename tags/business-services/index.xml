But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you need a bunch of fax machines in your office. You can send and receive faxes online, wherever you are, with the right fax plan.
Instead of a clunky fax machine, a fax service plan is much more practical. Fax machines can only send faxes and take up space, while a fax service plan lets you send and receive faxes digitally through email and an online account, using your computer or laptop.</description></item><item><title>Phone Toll-Free Service</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/phone-toll-free-service/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2023 11:49:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/phone-toll-free-service/</guid><description>In today&amp;rsquo;s competitive business landscape, making things easier for customers can give you a significant edge. Offering a toll-free number is a simple way to stand out, as it demonstrates value and eliminates a potential barrier for price-conscious customers.
While the cost of a phone call may seem trivial, even small expenses can influence purchasing decisions, especially for budget-conscious businesses. Providing a toll-free number removes this obstacle and presents a customer-friendly image.</description></item><item><title>T-1 Digital Telephone Lines</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/t-1-digital-telephone-lines/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Nov 2023 22:04:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/t-1-digital-telephone-lines/</guid><description>Businesses with multiple phone lines might be leaving money on the table if they haven&amp;rsquo;t explored T-1 digital phone lines. Even businesses already using T1 service might be unaware of potential savings from newer options.
Digital telephony emerged in the 1950s as phone companies sought efficient ways to handle large call volumes. Analog phone lines carried a single conversation per wire pair. While analog multiplexing (carrier telephony) allowed multiple calls on a single wire pair, it suffered from quality issues over long distances.</description></item><item><title>Can You Save 50% On Telecom Costs?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/can-you-save-50-on-telecom-costs/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Oct 2023 18:34:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/can-you-save-50-on-telecom-costs/</guid><description>Even with a tough economy, you might be overpaying for your business telecom services.

Many believe that 10 Mbps Ethernet is replacing traditional T1 lines, and for good reason. This article will explore why that is, how this technology works, and the steps to upgrade.
Businesses have relied on T1 lines for decades due to their high reliability, guaranteed bandwidth of 1.5 Mbps, and symmetrical upload and download speeds. Prices have also decreased over time, and availability is now widespread.
The main drawback of T1 lines is their limited bandwidth.</description></item><item><title>Get a Consumer Advocate On Your Side</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/get-a-consumer-advocate-on-your-side/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 May 2023 17:04:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/get-a-consumer-advocate-on-your-side/</guid><description>While we often think of consumer advocates as helping individuals, businesses can benefit from them too. After all, businesses are consumers too! They buy products and services just like people do. But when a business needs to purchase from a much larger company, it can be challenging to negotiate a fair deal.
This is especially true in the telecommunications industry. A mid-size business trying to negotiate with a telecom giant is at a disadvantage.</description></item><item><title>Finding An Ethernet Internet Provider</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/finding-an-ethernet-internet-provider/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Feb 2023 21:21:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/finding-an-ethernet-internet-provider/</guid><description>Looking for a better alternative to traditional internet services like T1 lines?

While they used to be costly and complex to set up, you can now get them instantly for $2 each.
This low price makes getting multiple toll-free numbers a smart move for marketing. Businesses advertise across various platforms and need a way to track which ads are effective. While coupon codes, unique web addresses, or phone extensions can help, they&amp;rsquo;re not foolproof.</description></item><item><title>Upgrading to Fiber FAQ</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/upgrading-to-fiber-faq/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Dec 2022 20:04:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/upgrading-to-fiber-faq/</guid><description>By: John Shepler
If your current bandwidth solution is nearing its capacity, it might be time for an upgrade. While your existing setup has served you well, you need something faster, more reliable, and with lower latency. Fiber optic technology offers a compelling solution, especially compared to traditional copper or cable. Let&amp;rsquo;s explore whether fiber is the right choice for your future needs and budget.

But did you know there are others, like 866? Is it truly toll-free?
Yes, 866 is indeed toll-free. It functions identically to 800; the difference is simply in the prefix. Just like area codes (202 for Washington, DC, 302 for Delaware), these prefixes are assigned nationwide.
This highlights a key difference: toll prefixes are location-specific (area codes), while toll-free prefixes are not.</description></item><item><title>Managed Hosting Service</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/managed-hosting-service/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Aug 2022 04:16:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/managed-hosting-service/</guid><description>When you have a website or online store, you&amp;rsquo;re already familiar with web hosting. But did you know there are different types of web hosting? One type you might not know about is managed hosting, which can be more reliable and affordable than trying to handle everything yourself.
In the early days of the internet, businesses often set up their websites by getting server software and using one computer as the web host.</description></item><item><title>Is Mobility Killing Your Company?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-mobility-killing-your-company/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Aug 2022 17:45:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-mobility-killing-your-company/</guid><description>Initially, only a few executives used company cell phones, which made sense for accessibility. However, this practice expanded to various levels of management, ultimately leading to company-issued smartphones for everyone. While this enhanced communication and response time, it resulted in a complex network of individual contracts and bills due to a phased implementation. Consequently, managing numerous contracts and potentially unused devices became a challenge.
Instead of handling this burden, businesses can outsource wireless cost control to specialized companies.</description></item><item><title>Still Your Best Toll Free Option</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/still-your-best-toll-free-option/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jun 2022 18:32:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/still-your-best-toll-free-option/</guid><description>Is a toll-free number right for your business? Maybe you&amp;rsquo;re already using a toll-free service but want a better deal or more numbers. What kind of service makes the most sense in today&amp;rsquo;s world?
If you&amp;rsquo;ve never used a toll-free number and aren&amp;rsquo;t sure how it will impact your business, it&amp;rsquo;s best to start affordably without a long-term commitment. This way, you can test it out and see the results. So, how do you do that?</description></item></channel></rss>
