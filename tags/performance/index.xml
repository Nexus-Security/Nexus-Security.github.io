Menâ€™s Chorus (SMC), an all-male choir in Singapore, has launched its first virtual choir project, &amp;ldquo;Why We Sing,&amp;rdquo; marking the return of arts performances in the country. The music video, available on SMC&amp;rsquo;s YouTube channel, was created over two months and conveys a message of hope: that the arts community can adapt to a new normal where the arts, especially music, are recognized for their essential role in community development...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/men-s-chorus-debuts-virtual-choir-performance/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/men-s-chorus-debuts-virtual-choir-performance/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Brand Alliance is set to release a new book highlighting the achievements of influential brands in Asia</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/brand-alliance-is-set-to-release-a-new-book-highlighting-the-achievements-of-influential-brands-in-asia/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Apr 2023 18:05:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/brand-alliance-is-set-to-release-a-new-book-highlighting-the-achievements-of-influential-brands-in-asia/</guid><description>Brand Alliance, a brand consulting firm, is releasing its inaugural book, &amp;ldquo;Influential Brands: A documentary of their heroic rise.&amp;rdquo; This book launch coincides with the firm&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;2014 Influential Brands&amp;rdquo; conference, themed &amp;ldquo;Celebrating brand leadership and Asia brand heroes&amp;rdquo;, taking place on November 7, 2014, at the Suntec City Convention Centre.

The resulting measurement curve demonstrates excellent performance, typical of DC motor models. It shows minimal fluctuations (less than 0.05%) over time, aligning with the service manual&amp;rsquo;s specifications. The initial upward slope, lasting a couple of hours, is a common trait in the 551x and 552x models...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-more-rpm-measurements/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-more-rpm-measurements/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): Initial RPM Performance Characterization</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-initial-rpm-performance-characterization/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jan 2023 09:18:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-initial-rpm-performance-characterization/</guid><description>This post follows up on my initial writing about the Beogram 4002 (5513). I used my recently created BeoloverRPM device to assess the unit&amp;rsquo;s RPM performance.
This test clearly showed the suspected rapid speed changes. The graph below displays the RPM over a roughly 24-hour period.
The abrupt negative spikes in the graph indicate that the DC motor and its control system require attention...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-initial-rpm-performance-characterization/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-initial-rpm-performance-characterization/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: RPM Performance Test</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-rpm-performance-test/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Dec 2022 15:55:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-rpm-performance-test/</guid><description>I recently measured the RPM performance of my restored Beogram 4000 turntable. I was curious to see how the AC motor compared to the DC motors found in other models, like the Beogram 8000/8002 with their computer-controlled linear motors. After running the 4000 for 12 hours using my BeoloverRPM device, the results were interesting.
The AC motor demonstrated excellent stability, as evidenced by the graph. However, there was an initial period of drift as both the oscillator and motor warmed up...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-rpm-performance-test/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-rpm-performance-test/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5514): RPM Performance Measurement after Restoration of DC Motor and Control System</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5514-rpm-performance-measurement-after-restoration-of-dc-motor-and-control-system/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Aug 2022 23:53:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5514-rpm-performance-measurement-after-restoration-of-dc-motor-and-control-system/</guid><description>Following the restoration of a Beogram 4002 (5514) turntable&amp;rsquo;s DC motor and control system, a 24-hour RPM performance test was conducted using a custom-built RPM monitoring device.
The initial performance, measured before the restoration, revealed noticeable, abrupt drops in RPM, indicating typical wear and tear in the DC motor&amp;rsquo;s brass sleeve bearings. These dips, while moderate in this instance, would have been audible due to their 1% magnitude.
After the restoration, which included rebuilding the motor and replacing RPM-related components, the significant RPM fluctuations were eliminated...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5514-rpm-performance-measurement-after-restoration-of-dc-motor-and-control-system/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5514-rpm-performance-measurement-after-restoration-of-dc-motor-and-control-system/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
