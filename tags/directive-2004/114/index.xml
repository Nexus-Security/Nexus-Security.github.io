As the new academic year begins, students across the EU are met with a mix of anticipation and anxiety. Juggling academics, finances, personal life, and social activities is a universal experience for students, and those from outside the EU face the added pressure of meeting immigration requirements.
These requirements are standardized by the EU&amp;rsquo;s 2004 Studentsâ€™ Directive. However, the degree of uniformity across member states remains unclear. Do individual countries retain the right to impose additional entry prerequisites?</description></item><item><title>Is the new Directive on immigration for students and researchers a minor advancement or a significant stride?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-new-directive-on-immigration-for-students-and-researchers-a-minor-advancement-or-a-significant-stride/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Dec 2023 21:38:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-new-directive-on-immigration-for-students-and-researchers-a-minor-advancement-or-a-significant-stride/</guid><description>Steve Peers
The EU has been working for many years to attract highly skilled individuals from non-EU countries. However, the European Commission&amp;rsquo;s reports indicate that the existing legislation, specifically the 2005 Researchers&amp;rsquo; Directive and the 2004 Students&amp;rsquo; Directive, have not significantly increased the number of students and researchers coming to the EU.
As a result, in 2013, the Commission recommended a complete overhaul of these laws. The European Parliament (EP) and the Council recently reached an agreement on the content of this proposal.</description></item><item><title>Additional research is required to further explore the EU's efforts to attract a greater number of non-EU researchers and students.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/additional-research-is-required-to-further-explore-the-eu-s-efforts-to-attract-a-greater-number-of-non-eu-researchers-and-students/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Aug 2022 01:20:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/additional-research-is-required-to-further-explore-the-eu-s-efforts-to-attract-a-greater-number-of-non-eu-researchers-and-students/</guid><description>Steve Peers
The EU member states, similar to other economically advanced nations, require a growing number of highly skilled workers. Current EU regulations have not significantly increased the influx of students and researchers from other countries, prompting the Commission to propose revisions in 2013. Both the European Parliament (EP) and the Council have agreed on their respective stances for the proposed law and are preparing to negotiate a final version.</description></item></channel></rss>
