National criminal justice systems are frequently criticized for overlooking the needs of crime victims. In contrast, the EU has been attentive to this matter since the initial stages of EU criminal law development. Early on, one of the EU&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Framework Decisions&amp;rsquo; addressed victims&amp;rsquo; rights. This measure has since been superseded by a comprehensive Directive on this subject, which Member States are required to implement by October 2015.</description></item></channel></rss>
