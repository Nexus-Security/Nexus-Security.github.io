The significant loss of life near Lampedusa last autumn, when numerous migrants drowned attempting to cross the Mediterranean, represents one of the most recent and tragic outcomes of irregular migration across this sea. This event should have prompted a thorough reevaluation of EU policies concerning border control and visas but did not. This inaction is likely due to concerns that far-right parties would exploit heightened public anxiety around migration.</description></item><item><title>How can the EU address migrant fatalities in the Mediterranean?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/how-can-the-eu-address-migrant-fatalities-in-the-mediterranean/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Aug 2022 15:07:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/how-can-the-eu-address-migrant-fatalities-in-the-mediterranean/</guid><description>The recent tragedies in the Mediterranean Sea have added to the already significant number of migrant deaths. EU officials are responding to this urgent issue, and this is what their response should include.
First, a large-scale search and rescue operation is needed. The EU&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Triton&amp;rsquo; operation, which replaced the Italian &amp;lsquo;Mare Nostrum,&amp;rsquo; is insufficient for saving lives. It was incorrectly assumed that ending &amp;lsquo;Mare Nostrum&amp;rsquo; would deter migrants and reduce deaths.</description></item></channel></rss>
