The International Labour Organization has labeled stress a &amp;ldquo;global epidemic&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;silent killer,&amp;rdquo; particularly within many Asian countries experiencing rapid economic growth and adopting Western lifestyles, including Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and mainland China.
