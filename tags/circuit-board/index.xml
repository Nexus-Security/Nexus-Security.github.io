I began by replacing the electrolytic capacitors. As I&amp;rsquo;ve noted before, these Beocord 9000 units often require minimal recapping, if any. This particular unit seems to have been stored for a considerable period, and I already discovered one faulty capacitor, prompting me to replace the others.
My usual practice is to use audio-grade capacitors in the signal path and opt for high-reliability, 105Â°C rated, long-lasting capacitors elsewhere...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-replacing-capacitors/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-replacing-capacitors/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beocord 9000: Replacing Capacitors Wrapped Up</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-replacing-capacitors-wrapped-up/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Aug 2022 16:07:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-replacing-capacitors-wrapped-up/</guid><description>The capacitor replacement on the Beocord 9000 cassette deck is complete, although it took a bit longer than anticipated. While most capacitors were within specification, a few were not, including two that had completely failed. Notably, a 220uF capacitor (C56) on the Microcomputer/Display board was the culprit behind the Beocord&amp;rsquo;s inability to power on. Another failed 220uF capacitor (C7) of the same brand was discovered on the Dolby board. This highlights the importance of checking all electrolytic capacitors in such situations...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-replacing-capacitors-wrapped-up/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-replacing-capacitors-wrapped-up/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
