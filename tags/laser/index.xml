Fiber optic transmission offers nearly limitless bandwidthâ€”a stark contrast to copper wireline services. However, even with fiber optic services, users typically select a fixed bandwidth level. This limits them, as upgrading often becomes the only way to obtain additional bandwidth when needed. In reality, these services utilize only a fraction of the fiber&amp;rsquo;s total capacity...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/wdm-wavelength-services-offer-expandability/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/wdm-wavelength-services-offer-expandability/</a></p></description></item><item><title>BenQ has recently introduced a new series of digital laser projectors that offer precise color accuracy</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/benq-has-recently-introduced-a-new-series-of-digital-laser-projectors-that-offer-precise-color-accuracy/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Aug 2022 21:00:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/benq-has-recently-introduced-a-new-series-of-digital-laser-projectors-that-offer-precise-color-accuracy/</guid><description>The BenQ LU9715 digital laser projector.
