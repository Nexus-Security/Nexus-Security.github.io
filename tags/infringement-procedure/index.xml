A key point of contention in post-Brexit EU/UK relations is the degree to which the UK remains bound to the EU Court of Justice (ECJ). This issue arises first in the withdrawal agreement being negotiated, a draft of which was recently proposed by the EU Commission. While it will eventually affect the future relationship between the two, this post focuses on the withdrawal agreement...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-resolution-of-disputes-and-the-role-of-the-ecj-in-the-proposed-withdrawal-agreement/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-resolution-of-disputes-and-the-role-of-the-ecj-in-the-proposed-withdrawal-agreement/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The CJEU issues its first ruling on interim measures regarding the rule of law in Poland.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-issues-its-first-ruling-on-interim-measures-regarding-the-rule-of-law-in-poland/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Dec 2023 06:10:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-issues-its-first-ruling-on-interim-measures-regarding-the-rule-of-law-in-poland/</guid><description>Daniel Sarmiento, Professor of EU Law at the University Complutense of Madrid*
The October 19th decision by the Vice-President of the Court of Justice concerning Poland&amp;rsquo;s Judiciary Reform Act is groundbreaking. This decision, which orders Poland to halt the implementation of the Act and prevents the removal of judges due to the new retirement age, represents uncharted territory. It places the Court of Justice in the unprecedented position of compelling a sovereign member state to decide between adhering to European integration principles or embracing illiberalism...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-issues-its-first-ruling-on-interim-measures-regarding-the-rule-of-law-in-poland/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-issues-its-first-ruling-on-interim-measures-regarding-the-rule-of-law-in-poland/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Preserving the Formal Rule of Law in the EU's Asylum Policy: The CJEU's Ruling on the Asylum Relocation Mechanism</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/preserving-the-formal-rule-of-law-in-the-eu-s-asylum-policy-the-cjeu-s-ruling-on-the-asylum-relocation-mechanism/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jun 2023 11:38:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/preserving-the-formal-rule-of-law-in-the-eu-s-asylum-policy-the-cjeu-s-ruling-on-the-asylum-relocation-mechanism/</guid><description>Niels Kirst, Ph.D. Researcher in European Union Law at the School of Law and Government of Dublin City University*

Introduction
A recent Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruling found Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic to be in violation of European Union (EU) law. The violation stems from their failure to implement two Council Decisions outlining the relocation of asylum seekers...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/preserving-the-formal-rule-of-law-in-the-eu-s-asylum-policy-the-cjeu-s-ruling-on-the-asylum-relocation-mechanism/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/preserving-the-formal-rule-of-law-in-the-eu-s-asylum-policy-the-cjeu-s-ruling-on-the-asylum-relocation-mechanism/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Should safeguarding the rule of law in the EU be the responsibility of the Commission?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/should-safeguarding-the-rule-of-law-in-the-eu-be-the-responsibility-of-the-commission/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jun 2023 21:22:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/should-safeguarding-the-rule-of-law-in-the-eu-be-the-responsibility-of-the-commission/</guid><description>Steve Peers
Concerns about upholding the rule of law within the European Union have arisen lately, particularly regarding government actions in Hungary and Romania. Currently, the EU can address breaches of EU law and penalize severe, ongoing violations of EU values, including rule of law. However, there&amp;rsquo;s no mechanism to handle potential EU value breaches not directly tied to EU law or not reaching the threshold of a serious persistent breach...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/should-safeguarding-the-rule-of-law-in-the-eu-be-the-responsibility-of-the-commission/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/should-safeguarding-the-rule-of-law-in-the-eu-be-the-responsibility-of-the-commission/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Enforcing Court of Justice Judgments</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/enforcing-court-of-justice-judgments/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Apr 2023 19:44:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/enforcing-court-of-justice-judgments/</guid><description>By Steve Peers
The European Court of Justice (ECJ) recently issued a noteworthy decision concerning the &amp;lsquo;infringement procedure,&amp;rsquo; a system for directly upholding EU law within EU courts. This system operates alongside national courts enforcing EU law. Article 258 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) outlines this system, allowing the Commission to bring cases to the ECJ against Member States allegedly violating EU law...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/enforcing-court-of-justice-judgments/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/enforcing-court-of-justice-judgments/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Transformation of the third pillar: The conclusion of the transition period for EU criminal and policing law</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/transformation-of-the-third-pillar-the-conclusion-of-the-transition-period-for-eu-criminal-and-policing-law/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Mar 2023 06:20:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/transformation-of-the-third-pillar-the-conclusion-of-the-transition-period-for-eu-criminal-and-policing-law/</guid><description>by Emilio De Capitani
On December 1st, 2014, after five years, the prior &amp;ldquo;third pillar&amp;rdquo; of EU law will transition from intergovernmental control to a supranational system. However, it remains unclear if this shift will result in a consistent policy that is properly executed by Member States and respects human rights.
Specifically, according to Article 10 of Protocol 36, added by the Lisbon Treaty, all EU measures concerning police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters adopted before the Lisbon Treaty will be treated like other EU laws regarding the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU)...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/transformation-of-the-third-pillar-the-conclusion-of-the-transition-period-for-eu-criminal-and-policing-law/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/transformation-of-the-third-pillar-the-conclusion-of-the-transition-period-for-eu-criminal-and-policing-law/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Is this the start of the downfall of Poland's controversial "judicial reforms"?

These changes include lowering the retirement age for judges on the country&amp;rsquo;s highest court. This move has been presented by the government as a necessary reform to hold accountable judges who were supposedly involved in the country&amp;rsquo;s previous communist regime, even though that regime ended three decades ago...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-this-the-start-of-the-downfall-of-poland-s-controversial-judicial-reforms-reflections-on-the-recent-ecj-decision-in-commission-v-poland-regarding-the-independence-of-the-supreme-court/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-this-the-start-of-the-downfall-of-poland-s-controversial-judicial-reforms-reflections-on-the-recent-ecj-decision-in-commission-v-poland-regarding-the-independence-of-the-supreme-court/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The CJEU affirms that data protection authorities are independent.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-affirms-that-data-protection-authorities-are-independent/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Aug 2022 07:07:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-affirms-that-data-protection-authorities-are-independent/</guid><description>Steve Peers
A recent judgment on data protection, while not as impactful as a prior ruling, is still significant. In Commission v Hungary, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) expanded on earlier decisions in Commission v Germany and Commission v Austria concerning the independent operation of data protection authorities. The judgment&amp;rsquo;s implications, however, reach beyond this specific area.
Background
The EU&amp;rsquo;s data protection Directive mandates that data protection authorities be established to uphold the Directive&amp;rsquo;s regulations, in addition to individual legal action...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-affirms-that-data-protection-authorities-are-independent/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-affirms-that-data-protection-authorities-are-independent/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
