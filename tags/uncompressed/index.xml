While older 4:3 aspect ratio televisions still exist, they are sustained by cable and satellite receivers. However, high-definition (HD) channels are becoming more prevalent, and standard-definition channels are being phased out as viewers switch to flat-screen HD TVs. The future of television is internet protocol television (IPTV) in high definition, with 3D technology on the horizon.
For broadcasters, distributors, and content providers, traditional video transport methods are no longer adequate.</description></item></channel></rss>
