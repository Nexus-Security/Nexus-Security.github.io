As the new academic year begins, students across the EU are met with a mix of anticipation and anxiety. Juggling academics, finances, personal life, and social activities is a universal experience for students, and those from outside the EU face the added pressure of meeting immigration requirements.
These requirements are standardized by the EU&amp;rsquo;s 2004 Studentsâ€™ Directive. However, the degree of uniformity across member states remains unclear. Do individual countries retain the right to impose additional entry prerequisites?..<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-has-confirmed-that-students-from-third-countries-have-the-right-to-enter-school/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-has-confirmed-that-students-from-third-countries-have-the-right-to-enter-school/</a></p></description></item><item><title>This year, Singapore and Korea have emerged as the top universities in Asia</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/this-year-singapore-and-korea-have-emerged-as-the-top-universities-in-asia/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Feb 2024 07:44:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/this-year-singapore-and-korea-have-emerged-as-the-top-universities-in-asia/</guid><description>The National University of Singapore (NUS) has achieved the top ranking in Asia for the first time, according to the QS University Rankings: Asia 2014 published on www.topuniversities.com.

The EU has been working for many years to attract highly skilled individuals from non-EU countries. However, the European Commission&amp;rsquo;s reports indicate that the existing legislation, specifically the 2005 Researchers&amp;rsquo; Directive and the 2004 Students&amp;rsquo; Directive, have not significantly increased the number of students and researchers coming to the EU.
As a result, in 2013, the Commission recommended a complete overhaul of these laws. The European Parliament (EP) and the Council recently reached an agreement on the content of this proposal...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-new-directive-on-immigration-for-students-and-researchers-a-minor-advancement-or-a-significant-stride/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-new-directive-on-immigration-for-students-and-researchers-a-minor-advancement-or-a-significant-stride/</a></p></description></item><item><title>India is making strides towards achieving global recognition for its universities</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/india-is-making-strides-towards-achieving-global-recognition-for-its-universities/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Dec 2022 23:01:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/india-is-making-strides-towards-achieving-global-recognition-for-its-universities/</guid><description>Indian educational institutions are increasingly recognizing the value of global university rankings, according to Quacquarelli Symonds (QS), the organization behind the recently released Asian Universities Ranking for 2014.

Past research connected low vitamin D levels with illnesses like multiple sclerosis, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. To clarify if vitamin D supplementation by itself (without calcium or other interventions) impacts death from various causes, researchers examined 73 observational cohort studies and 22 randomized trials on naturally occurring vitamin D and supplements (D2 or D3)...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/vitamin-d-does-not-increase-longevity/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/vitamin-d-does-not-increase-longevity/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Universiti Putra Malaysia is leaving a significant impact on the academic world with its free MOOC platform</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/universiti-putra-malaysia-is-leaving-a-significant-impact-on-the-academic-world-with-its-free-mooc-platform/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Sep 2022 04:47:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/universiti-putra-malaysia-is-leaving-a-significant-impact-on-the-academic-world-with-its-free-mooc-platform/</guid><description>Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) is providing a free online learning platform accessible to both Malaysians and a global audience.
