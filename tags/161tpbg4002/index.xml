The motor was dead on arrival, so I opened it up and discovered a broken commutator spring that had been taped on with electrical tape.
Unsurprisingly, the motor wouldn&amp;rsquo;t turn. I also found a broken lead on one of the sensing coils, which should have a resistance of 22 Ohms between the contact terminals.
This break disabled the motor&amp;rsquo;s feedback mechanism...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-restoration-of-the-dc-motor-oil-infusion-of-bearings-and-repair-of-a-broken-off-brush-and-a-disconnected-sensing-coil/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-restoration-of-the-dc-motor-oil-infusion-of-bearings-and-repair-of-a-broken-off-brush-and-a-disconnected-sensing-coil/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 DC Motor: Spark Snubber Replacement</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-dc-motor-spark-snubber-replacement/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Apr 2024 13:03:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-dc-motor-spark-snubber-replacement/</guid><description>I recently had a Beogram 4002 DC platter motor on my workbench that I had previously worked on in November 2016 due to a broken brush and a severed pickup coil lead.
The motor recently began experiencing RPM fluctuations again.
This pointed to a problem with the spark snubbers. To access the rotor, I opened the motor:
The spark snubbers, marked with red dots, are located around the commutator. The replacements are on the black pad...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-dc-motor-spark-snubber-replacement/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-dc-motor-spark-snubber-replacement/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
