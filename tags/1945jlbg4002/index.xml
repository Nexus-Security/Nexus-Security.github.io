A previous post documented the initial assessment of the unit.
Upon beginning the restoration, the turntable was in relatively original condition. However, the platter motor showed signs of prior work, evidenced by an incorrectly installed pulley.
To address this, the motor was removed and disassembled to extract and lubricate the bearings. This involved immersing them in motor oil under vacuum until air bubbles ceased to appear, indicating the bearings were properly saturated.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (Type 5513): A New Arrival from Florida</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-a-new-arrival-from-florida/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jun 2023 18:24:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-a-new-arrival-from-florida/</guid><description>A customer from Florida recently sent me a DC-motor Beogram 4002 (Type 5513) turntable in its original packaging. After unboxing and setting it up, I observed the aluminum surfaces were in good shape, but the keypad showed typical wear. A refurbished keypad could address this issue. The plinth itself is in excellent condition with sharp corners.
Internally, the turntable appears largely original except for signs of work done on the motor.</description></item></channel></rss>
