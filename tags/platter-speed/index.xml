Using a helpful audio path diagram, continuity checks were performed from the cartridge connector to ensure proper signal flow.
The replacement phono plug, a REAN model with gold contact pins, was installed, though the tight fit of the rubber boot on the cable posed a minor challenge. As an improvement, a grounding switch was added to the output board, eliminating the need for an external grounding wire...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-final-tasks-adjustments-playing-records/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-final-tasks-adjustments-playing-records/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 Type 5513: Installing Beolover RPM Indicators, Rechecking Platter Speed, Beginning the Reassembly</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-installing-beolover-rpm-indicators-rechecking-platter-speed-beginning-the-reassembly/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Nov 2022 07:50:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-installing-beolover-rpm-indicators-rechecking-platter-speed-beginning-the-reassembly/</guid><description>I replaced the RPM indicator lamps in my Beogram 400x turntable with LED modules from Beolover. This upgrade, motivated by the LEDs&amp;rsquo; stability rather than longevity, aims to enhance platter motor speed stability, a known benefit observed in Beolover&amp;rsquo;s motor restorations. The interconnectedness of the RPM lamps and the platter motor circuit underscores their impact on performance.
The original incandescent lamps were removed from the Beogram 4002 Type 5513 RPM Indicator Panel and replaced with the Beolover LED modules, which were secured and insulated using the provided double-sided mounting tape...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-installing-beolover-rpm-indicators-rechecking-platter-speed-beginning-the-reassembly/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-installing-beolover-rpm-indicators-rechecking-platter-speed-beginning-the-reassembly/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
