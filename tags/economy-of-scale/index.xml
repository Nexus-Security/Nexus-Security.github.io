Colocation Centers: A Hub for Connectivity
Carriers are drawn to locations called colocation centers, or colos, and carrier hotels. These large data centers are designed to accommodate multiple tenants, unlike typical data centers that serve a single company.</description></item><item><title>Double Bonded T1 Cost and Alternatives</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/double-bonded-t1-cost-and-alternatives/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jul 2022 23:16:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/double-bonded-t1-cost-and-alternatives/</guid><description>Many businesses appreciate their reliable T1 service, but eventually, the 1.5 Mbps bandwidth becomes insufficient. Instead of abandoning T1, companies can opt for double bonded T1 service, which combines two lines to provide 3 Mbps. This bonding is implemented within customer premises equipment, usually a router with two T1 inputs.
The bandwidth can be further increased by triple bonding (4.5 Mbps) or quadruple bonding (6 Mbps), up to a practical limit of eight bonded lines for 12 Mbps.</description></item></channel></rss>
