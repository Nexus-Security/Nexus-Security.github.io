This means customers can easily access Netflix content directly on their TVs.
Subscribers with set-top boxes connected to Singtel Fibre Broadband can find Netflix on Channel 404 or by using the Quick Access Button on their remote. This feature will be rolled out gradually and should be available to all customers by the end of April.
Through an exclusive partnership, Singtel is offering customers up to nine free months of Netflix when they re-contract or sign up for eligible mobile, fiber broadband, and Singtel TV plans.</description></item><item><title>Singapore is set to release a coin set called The Splendour of Native Orchids Series</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/singapore-is-set-to-release-a-coin-set-called-the-splendour-of-native-orchids-series/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jun 2022 15:57:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/singapore-is-set-to-release-a-coin-set-called-the-splendour-of-native-orchids-series/</guid><description>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is releasing a special coin set called &amp;ldquo;The Splendor of Native Orchids Series.&amp;rdquo; This set includes ten 999 fine silver proof coins, each showcasing a different orchid from the &amp;ldquo;Native Orchids of Singapore&amp;rdquo; coin series issued between 2011 and 2015.
