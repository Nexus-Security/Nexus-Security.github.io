Introduction
The best way to regulate abuse of dominance in the EU has been a subject of much discussion. In the early 2000s, aiming to address criticisms of its approach to unilateral conduct control, the European Commission started reviewing the relevant law, including how it was being applied (see the EAGCP Report and the Discussion Paper)...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-a-title-sufficient-to-override-constitutional-rules-and-fundamental-rule-of-law-principles-a-paper-on-enforcement-priorities-for-article-102-tfeu/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-a-title-sufficient-to-override-constitutional-rules-and-fundamental-rule-of-law-principles-a-paper-on-enforcement-priorities-for-article-102-tfeu/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Whistleblower Protection: The Latest EU Directive</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/whistleblower-protection-the-latest-eu-directive/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 May 2023 05:04:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/whistleblower-protection-the-latest-eu-directive/</guid><description>Vigjilenca Abazi, Assistant Professor of EU Law, Maastricht University &amp;amp; Fellow, Yale Law School

On April 16th, the European Parliament overwhelmingly voted to approve a new law protecting whistleblowers within the European Union. This Directive establishes high standards and exemplifies how collaborative efforts between civil society organizations, NGOs, trade unions, journalists, academics, whistleblowers, and the European Parliament can produce progressive legislation that strengthens the safeguards for upholding the rule of law in Europe...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/whistleblower-protection-the-latest-eu-directive/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/whistleblower-protection-the-latest-eu-directive/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Maxima Latvija: Non-compete clauses in commercial lease agreements are considered competition restrictions by their nature.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/maxima-latvija-non-compete-clauses-in-commercial-lease-agreements-are-considered-competition-restrictions-by-their-nature/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 May 2023 00:48:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/maxima-latvija-non-compete-clauses-in-commercial-lease-agreements-are-considered-competition-restrictions-by-their-nature/</guid><description>Michele Giannino (Italian qualified lawyer: LL.M.

EU Member States are nearing the deadline to implement the EU Damages Directive. This directive aims to empower consumers and small businesses to seek damages from parties who violate competition law.
Although the need for such a directive was questioned in the past, the current perspective has significantly shifted. Nevertheless, adapting to this new approach presents ongoing challenges.
Background
Adopted in December 2014, the Directive mandates that all EU and EEA member states ensure individuals and entities impacted by competition law violations can claim and receive full compensation for their losses...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/where-are-eu-consumers-actions-for-damages-headed/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/where-are-eu-consumers-actions-for-damages-headed/</a></p></description></item><item><title>How do the Court's rulings on December 21, 2023 impact UEFA's position as a 'gatekeeper' in the Football Revolution?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/how-do-the-court-s-rulings-on-december-21-2023-impact-uefa-s-position-as-a-gatekeeper-in-the-football-revolution/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Oct 2022 02:44:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/how-do-the-court-s-rulings-on-december-21-2023-impact-uefa-s-position-as-a-gatekeeper-in-the-football-revolution/</guid><description>Steve Weatherill, Somerville College and Faculty of Law, University of Oxford

Summary
Recent Court of Justice rulings on December 21, 2023, determined that practices requiring prior approval for new sporting competitions created by external entities clash with EU law. This decision primarily stemmed from the lack of clear, unbiased, and transparent criteria and procedures. While governing bodies, particularly in football, are obligated to adjust their practices, the extent of their authority as gatekeepers remains unclear...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/how-do-the-court-s-rulings-on-december-21-2023-impact-uefa-s-position-as-a-gatekeeper-in-the-football-revolution/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/how-do-the-court-s-rulings-on-december-21-2023-impact-uefa-s-position-as-a-gatekeeper-in-the-football-revolution/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The Attorney General considers the intersection of public health, trade, and competition in setting minimum alcohol pricing.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-attorney-general-considers-the-intersection-of-public-health-trade-and-competition-in-setting-minimum-alcohol-pricing/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Oct 2022 07:29:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-attorney-general-considers-the-intersection-of-public-health-trade-and-competition-in-setting-minimum-alcohol-pricing/</guid><description>Angus MacCulloch, Lancaster University Law School Background to the Opinion Advocate General (AG) Bot provided his opinion on September 3rd, 2015, regarding Case C-333/14, which involved the Scottish Government&amp;rsquo;s plan to establish a minimum price per unit (Â£0.50) on alcohol sales.
