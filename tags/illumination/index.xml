The 33 RPM bulb had burned out, prompting the decision to replace both bulbs with custom-designed SMD LED assemblies. Recognizing the importance of a red light component for illuminating the red RPM indicators, red-green LEDs were chosen. While amber LEDs offer an incandescent-like aesthetic, their narrow wavelength distribution hinders their ability to effectively illuminate red surfaces...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5521-replacing-the-rpm-scale-illumination-bulbs-with-smd-leds/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5521-replacing-the-rpm-scale-illumination-bulbs-with-smd-leds/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beocord 9000: Restoration of the Peak Program Meter with SMD LEDs (I)</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-restoration-of-the-peak-program-meter-with-smd-leds-i-/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Nov 2023 04:08:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-restoration-of-the-peak-program-meter-with-smd-leds-i-/</guid><description>While I&amp;rsquo;m waiting for a part for a Beocord 9000 cassette deck, I&amp;rsquo;ve started restoring another one with faulty displays. It seems cassettes are making a comeback! I&amp;rsquo;m even hoping for new tapes and maybe even a revival of the Sony Walkman II.
This particular Beocord 9000 has a very dim display:

The &amp;ldquo;Time Cal&amp;rdquo; bulb is also weak, a common issue.

The initial step involved switching the original current limiting resistors with values suitable for modern SMD LEDs. These LEDs are more efficient and brighter, requiring significantly larger resistors to match the original brightness. Testing showed that 470 Ohm and 330 Ohm resistors for red and green LEDs, respectively, produced slightly brighter output compared to the original 180 Ohm and 120 Ohm resistors...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-restoration-of-the-peak-program-meter-with-smd-leds-iii-/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-restoration-of-the-peak-program-meter-with-smd-leds-iii-/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beocord 9000: Replacing the Incandescent Indicator Light Bulbs with SMD LEDs</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-replacing-the-incandescent-indicator-light-bulbs-with-smd-leds/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Oct 2023 13:48:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-replacing-the-incandescent-indicator-light-bulbs-with-smd-leds/</guid><description>During the restoration of a Beocord 9000, two indicator lights presented problems. One had a typical issue with a broken lead, while the other had become dim due to a deteriorating filament.
To address this, I opted to use SMD LEDs as replacements, similar to a method I&amp;rsquo;ve used for Beomaster 8000 units, documented on my blog. This provides lasting stability and safeguards against potential shipping damage. However, the Beocord 9000 has more compact reflector housings compared to the Beomaster 8000, necessitating a redesign of the PCBs for the LEDs...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-replacing-the-incandescent-indicator-light-bulbs-with-smd-leds/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-replacing-the-incandescent-indicator-light-bulbs-with-smd-leds/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beocord 9000: Restoration of the Peak Program Meter Scale Illumination</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-restoration-of-the-peak-program-meter-scale-illumination/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Oct 2023 08:25:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-restoration-of-the-peak-program-meter-scale-illumination/</guid><description>Even though the scale illumination light bulb was functioning in the Beocord 9000 display, my customer opted for a replacement to avoid any potential issues during shipping. This makes sense because these bulbs are fragile and prone to breaking, especially with rough handling. I prefer to replace all bulbs to prevent future problems.
I performed this procedure before on a Beocord 9000 with a broken bulb, as documented on my blog...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-restoration-of-the-peak-program-meter-scale-illumination/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-restoration-of-the-peak-program-meter-scale-illumination/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Redesigned Drop-In Tracking Sensor Light Bulb Replacement</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-redesigned-drop-in-tracking-sensor-light-bulb-replacement/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Apr 2023 17:54:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-redesigned-drop-in-tracking-sensor-light-bulb-replacement/</guid><description>During the restoration of a Beogram 4000 turntable, I decided to upgrade the tracking sensor light bulb with a new SMD LED design I had created. My previous design lacked stability with the intensity adjustment trimmer, so I redesigned it to be more secure and visually appealing.
The new design incorporates the trimmer directly onto the circuit board and houses it within the light shield. This required modifications to the 3D printed housing to accommodate the trimmer...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-redesigned-drop-in-tracking-sensor-light-bulb-replacement/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-redesigned-drop-in-tracking-sensor-light-bulb-replacement/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: An Unusual Keypad PCB</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-an-unusual-keypad-pcb/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Feb 2023 07:17:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-an-unusual-keypad-pcb/</guid><description>This article highlights a unique Beogram 4000 keyboard PCB. Typically, the two bulbs illuminating the position scale are wired in series, using two 12V bulbs connected between the 24V power source and ground. This setup is illustrated in the first image and diagram. Notably, this series configuration results in the bulbs having opposite polarity.
This polarity difference is ideal for the author&amp;rsquo;s polarized LED replacement boards.

To reattach the red-green covers, I secured the display to ensure a tight seal, preventing light leakage. Using a soldering iron, I melted the plastic posts of the covers, replicating the original attachment method.
During cleaning, the glue holding the light guide dissolved, indicating it was likely polyvinyl ester-based.

This common issue stems from the age of the bulbs, as their leads tend to oxidize and break under pressure.
The initial state of the display, lacking illumination for the numbers on the dB scale, is shown below:
The bulb is inserted into a waveguide that distributes light across the scale, with a textured surface behind the numbers for diffusion...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-peak-program-meter-scale-illumination-with-a-redgreen-led/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-peak-program-meter-scale-illumination-with-a-redgreen-led/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Replacing the Keypad Light Bulbs with LEDs</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-replacing-the-keypad-light-bulbs-with-leds/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Aug 2022 10:16:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-replacing-the-keypad-light-bulbs-with-leds/</guid><description>My Beogram 4000 restoration continued with replacing the control panel&amp;rsquo;s light bulbs with LEDs.

The top two bulbs illuminate the Beogram&amp;rsquo;s unique position indicator, while the vertical bulbs light the RPM trimmers. I recently designed SMD LED-based PCB replacements for the position indicator bulbs (available via email).
Standard red LEDs with current-limiting resistors can replace the RPM trimmer bulbs...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-replacing-the-keypad-light-bulbs-with-leds/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-replacing-the-keypad-light-bulbs-with-leds/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
