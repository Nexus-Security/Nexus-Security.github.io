At a basic level, GP tracks who posted specific transactions, and when certain records were modified. The Human Resources module allows tracking of pay and position changes, including the reason for the change. However, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t track the values before and after the change. Additionally, you can control who can post transactions and access specific information through posting setup and security settings.</description></item><item><title>Tracking activities in Dynamics GP</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/tracking-activities-in-dynamics-gp/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jun 2023 05:50:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/tracking-activities-in-dynamics-gp/</guid><description>This blog has relocated to https://blog.steveendow.com/.

It&amp;rsquo;s not unusual for me to get questions about viewing Dynamics GP security and access logs, specifically about who logged in and when. This usually comes up when clients need to investigate a past issue. However, GP doesn&amp;rsquo;t inherently log these events, so this type of data typically doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist.
For those who see the need for such logs, it&amp;rsquo;s worth exploring Dynamics GP&amp;rsquo;s Activity Tracking feature.</description></item></channel></rss>
