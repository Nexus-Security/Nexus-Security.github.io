Using a helpful audio path diagram, continuity checks were performed from the cartridge connector to ensure proper signal flow.
The replacement phono plug, a REAN model with gold contact pins, was installed, though the tight fit of the rubber boot on the cable posed a minor challenge. As an improvement, a grounding switch was added to the output board, eliminating the need for an external grounding wire.</description></item><item><title>Bay Area Beogram 8002: Cabinet Work Completion to First Record Play</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/bay-area-beogram-8002-cabinet-work-completion-to-first-record-play/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Mar 2024 04:11:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/bay-area-beogram-8002-cabinet-work-completion-to-first-record-play/</guid><description>I finally set up the Beogram 8002 turntable in a listening room to test its functionality.
While reassembly took a bit longer than expected due to a slight detour to repair chipped rosewood trim on the front panel.
Although fixing the trim wasn&amp;rsquo;t part of the initial restoration plan, I decided against leaving the front panel chipped.
Repairs involving glue, like this one, often take longer than expected due to the curing time.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 Type 5513: Houston Beogram #3 Ready for Action Again</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-houston-beogram-3-ready-for-action-again/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2023 15:14:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-houston-beogram-3-ready-for-action-again/</guid><description>My favorite stage of the Beogram 4002 restoration is here. The only remaining tasks are some enjoyable record-playing tests in my office. I find listening to records through a favorite system while working far more pleasurable than watching television&amp;hellip;and it&amp;rsquo;s a necessary job that someone has to do.
I&amp;rsquo;m truly happy with how this Beogram turned out. Knowing this turntable has been meticulously serviced is a great feeling. It&amp;rsquo;s spotless inside, and Beolover did an exceptional job revitalizing the platter motor.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 Type 5513: First Listening Test</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-first-listening-test/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jul 2023 16:04:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-first-listening-test/</guid><description>I finished the mechanical adjustments on the Beogram today. After turning on my digital scale, I calibrated and locked the tonearm&amp;rsquo;s tracking force counterweight. Following Beolover&amp;rsquo;s method, I secured the calibrated setting by replacing the M3 counterweight adjustment screw on the back of the tonearm with a tightening nut. This prevents accidental changes during transport or handling.
With the counterweight set, I secured the locking nut and added a touch of glue for extra stability.</description></item></channel></rss>
