The European Union Council recently established guidelines for freedom of expression. These guidelines, falling under the Foreign Affairs Council, are designed for application within the framework of the Union’s Common Foreign and Security Policy, similar to previous guidelines addressing issues like torture, capital punishment, and human rights advocates.</description></item><item><title>Judicial oversight of suspected violations of fundamental rights in the execution of Eulex Kosovo and the Advocate General's Ćapeta's Opinion in Joined Cases C-29/22 P and C-44/22 P.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/judicial-oversight-of-suspected-violations-of-fundamental-rights-in-the-execution-of-eulex-kosovo-and-the-advocate-general-s-apeta-s-opinion-in-joined-cases-c-29-22-p-and-c-44-22-p/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2024 19:53:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/judicial-oversight-of-suspected-violations-of-fundamental-rights-in-the-execution-of-eulex-kosovo-and-the-advocate-general-s-apeta-s-opinion-in-joined-cases-c-29-22-p-and-c-44-22-p/</guid><description>Antje Kunst*

In a recent legal opinion, Advocate General Ćapeta addressed the question of whether individuals can sue the European Union for damages related to alleged fundamental rights violations during an EU mission. The case involved KS and KD, whose family members disappeared and were killed in Kosovo in 1999. They allege that Eulex Kosovo, an EU mission tasked with investigating such crimes, failed to adequately investigate their cases.</description></item><item><title>The Council needs to quickly establish a legal framework similar to the CEOS for employees working in CSDP missions: Analysis of the Jenkinson case (Case C-46/22 P)</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-council-needs-to-quickly-establish-a-legal-framework-similar-to-the-ceos-for-employees-working-in-csdp-missions-analysis-of-the-jenkinson-case-case-c-46-22-p/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Mar 2024 21:26:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-council-needs-to-quickly-establish-a-legal-framework-similar-to-the-ceos-for-employees-working-in-csdp-missions-analysis-of-the-jenkinson-case-case-c-46-22-p/</guid><description>Antje Kunst*

Introduction
In a January 18, 2024, ruling, the European Union Court of Justice dismissed an appeal by Irish citizen Mr. Jenkinson. This decision impacts thousands of individuals working in EU international missions governed by the EU&amp;rsquo;s Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). While the Court sided with the defendants (the Council, Commission, European External Action Service, and Eulex Kosovo), their victory is questionable.</description></item><item><title>Council v H: Another Court victory in the Common Foreign and Security Policy</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/council-v-h-another-court-victory-in-the-common-foreign-and-security-policy/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Feb 2024 01:29:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/council-v-h-another-court-victory-in-the-common-foreign-and-security-policy/</guid><description>Graham Butler, PhD Fellow at the Centre for Comparative and European Constitutional Studies, Faculty of Law, University of Copenhagen, Denmark
Introduction
This summer, the Court of Justice (the Court) issued two significant decisions influencing the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) legal landscape. Despite the Treaty of Lisbon&amp;rsquo;s integration of this largely intergovernmental area (previously the Second Pillar) into the unified ‘EU’, its legacy persists. Enduring evidence of CFSP as a distinct yet incorporated legal domain allows it to be termed ‘CFSP law’.</description></item><item><title>Review of the updated Brexit withdrawal agreement: examining the political declaration on the future relationship between the EU and UK</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/review-of-the-updated-brexit-withdrawal-agreement-examining-the-political-declaration-on-the-future-relationship-between-the-eu-and-uk/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Dec 2023 05:57:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/review-of-the-updated-brexit-withdrawal-agreement-examining-the-political-declaration-on-the-future-relationship-between-the-eu-and-uk/</guid><description>Professor Steve Peers, University of Essex
Introduction
If Brexit proceeds based on the updated withdrawal agreement, what will the UK-EU relationship look like? The revised political declaration addresses this, outlining the future relationship. This declaration, revised during recent UK-EU negotiations, clarifies their post-Brexit partnership.
Although not legally binding as a treaty, the political declaration gains relevance domestically through the proposed withdrawal agreement bill. This bill mandates that Parliament&amp;rsquo;s agenda for the future relationship must align with the declaration.</description></item><item><title>What is the appropriate response from the EU to the unlawful blocking of the Lachin corridor?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-is-the-appropriate-response-from-the-eu-to-the-unlawful-blocking-of-the-lachin-corridor/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Nov 2023 04:20:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-is-the-appropriate-response-from-the-eu-to-the-unlawful-blocking-of-the-lachin-corridor/</guid><description>Nariné Ghazaryan, Assistant Professor in International and European Law, Radboud University Nijmegen

The 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war ceasefire agreement, brokered by Russia, was seen with skepticism by close observers of the region. By mid-2021, attacks on Armenian territory made it evident that the ceasefire was unstable. This prompted the EU to take a leading role in peace negotiations between Armenia and Azerbaijan. This leadership involved high-profile mediation by European Council President Charles Michel, focusing on prisoner exchanges, discreet diplomatic initiatives, and a series of high-level trilateral meetings throughout 2021 and 2022.</description></item><item><title>The Court of Justice of the European Union will soon examine important legal matters related to EU sanctions against non-EU countries.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-court-of-justice-of-the-european-union-will-soon-examine-important-legal-matters-related-to-eu-sanctions-against-non-eu-countries/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Oct 2023 14:46:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-court-of-justice-of-the-european-union-will-soon-examine-important-legal-matters-related-to-eu-sanctions-against-non-eu-countries/</guid><description>Stian Øby Johansen, PhD fellow at the University of Oslo Faculty of Law*
I recently attended a hearing at the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) concerning a case brought by Russian energy company Rosneft against EU sanctions imposed after Russia&amp;rsquo;s intervention in Crimea. The case, heard by the High Court of Justice (England &amp;amp; Wales), asks the CJEU to clarify the legitimacy of several aspects of these EU sanctions.</description></item><item><title>EU leaders are avoiding taking significant action to address the migrant crisis.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/eu-leaders-are-avoiding-taking-significant-action-to-address-the-migrant-crisis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Oct 2023 18:58:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/eu-leaders-are-avoiding-taking-significant-action-to-address-the-migrant-crisis/</guid><description>Steve Peers
EU leaders convened yesterday and agreed on a policy to handle the escalating migrant death toll in the Mediterranean Sea. This new policy expands on the recently implemented 10-point plan established by ministers. Notably, some significant last-minute revisions to the initial draft highlight the leaders&amp;rsquo; priorities.
Detailed comments
The leaders&amp;rsquo; statement appears to demonstrate more empathy than the prior 10-point plan. It acknowledges the immense loss of life as a tragedy and prioritizes the prevention of further deaths at sea.</description></item><item><title>Is the Court of Justice in Bank Refah Kargaran making a groundbreaking decision by allowing action for damages in relation to CFSP decisions regarding restrictive measures?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-court-of-justice-in-bank-refah-kargaran-making-a-groundbreaking-decision-by-allowing-action-for-damages-in-relation-to-cfsp-decisions-regarding-restrictive-measures/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Sep 2023 04:47:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-court-of-justice-in-bank-refah-kargaran-making-a-groundbreaking-decision-by-allowing-action-for-damages-in-relation-to-cfsp-decisions-regarding-restrictive-measures/</guid><description>Professor Dr. Peter Van Elsuwege and Joyce De Coninck (PhD Researcher), Ghent European Law Institute

Introduction
The recent ruling in Case C-180/20 (the CEPA case) marks a new chapter in the ongoing debate about the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and its boundaries. This case saw the Commission challenge the Council&amp;rsquo;s decision to deviate from a proposed Council Decision concerning the EU-Armenian Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement (CEPA).</description></item><item><title>Can a third state legally challenge EU restrictive measures?

In the legal case Venezuela v Council (C-872/19 P), the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) reversed a prior General Court decision. It determined that Venezuela has the right to legally challenge EU sanctions imposed against it. This judgment is groundbreaking as it allows any third-party country facing EU economic sanctions to challenge them in EU courts, a precedent not previously established.</description></item><item><title>Speeches on the UK's future relationship with the EU by Theresa May and Boris Johnson: Lions vs. Unicorns</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/speeches-on-the-uk-s-future-relationship-with-the-eu-by-theresa-may-and-boris-johnson-lions-vs-unicorns/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jul 2023 15:04:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/speeches-on-the-uk-s-future-relationship-with-the-eu-by-theresa-may-and-boris-johnson-lions-vs-unicorns/</guid><description>Professor Steve Peers, University of Essex
Speeches delivered last week by Theresa May and Boris Johnson regarding the UK&amp;rsquo;s future relationship with the EU present a study in contrasts. May&amp;rsquo;s approach was measured and pragmatic, advocating for close ties, while Johnson&amp;rsquo;s came across as dismissive and lacking depth, favoring distance from the EU.
While the EU27 has begun drafting treaty texts for Brexit, the UK has not. To illustrate potential outcomes, this post includes draft treaties based on Johnson&amp;rsquo;s and May&amp;rsquo;s security proposals.</description></item><item><title>The CJEU guarantees the fundamental democratic and judicial oversight of the EU's foreign policy.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-guarantees-the-fundamental-democratic-and-judicial-oversight-of-the-eu-s-foreign-policy/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jul 2023 08:00:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-guarantees-the-fundamental-democratic-and-judicial-oversight-of-the-eu-s-foreign-policy/</guid><description>Steve Peers
The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) confirmed in its recent decision in European Parliament v Council that the EU&amp;rsquo;s Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) is subject to a minimum standard of democratic and judicial oversight.
The case involved a challenge by the European Parliament (EP) to the Council&amp;rsquo;s decision to sign and ratify a treaty between the EU and Mauritius. This treaty pertained to the EU&amp;rsquo;s military operations against pirates operating in the Indian Ocean.</description></item><item><title>Could the EU be considering the formation of a military force, and would the UK have the power to block it?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/could-the-eu-be-considering-the-formation-of-a-military-force-and-would-the-uk-have-the-power-to-block-it/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jun 2023 05:57:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/could-the-eu-be-considering-the-formation-of-a-military-force-and-would-the-uk-have-the-power-to-block-it/</guid><description>Steve Peers
Recent discussions have centered around whether the EU is forming an army and if the UK has the power to veto such a move before Brexit. This debate, while heated, often lacks clarity. This piece aims to provide a clear understanding of the situation, concluding that the recent proposals don&amp;rsquo;t constitute an EU army, making a UK veto irrelevant.
Background
The EU&amp;rsquo;s foreign policy initially avoided defense matters, respecting Irish neutrality and the UK&amp;rsquo;s commitment to NATO.</description></item><item><title>Is there another accountability gap with the European Peace Facility?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-there-another-accountability-gap-with-the-european-peace-facility/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Nov 2022 12:49:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-there-another-accountability-gap-with-the-european-peace-facility/</guid><description>Ellen Cantraine, PhD researcher, Ghent European Law Institute

Introduction
Following the 2021 coup attempt in Mali, the EU&amp;rsquo;s mission in Mali (EUTM) continued operating despite concerning reports of serious misconduct by EU-trained soldiers.

Article 24(1) of the Treaty on the European Union states that the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) operates under distinct rules and procedures, explicitly stating that the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) holds no jurisdiction over these provisions.
Legal experts are debating whether &amp;ldquo;the CJEU shall not have jurisdiction&amp;rdquo; implies a degree of jurisdiction. AG Wahl articulated this question: Does the exclusion of CJEU jurisdiction encompass all CFSP actions or only specific categories?</description></item><item><title>EU foreign policy sanctions: utilizing EU criminal law powers to extend and enforce them</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/eu-foreign-policy-sanctions-utilizing-eu-criminal-law-powers-to-extend-and-enforce-them/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Nov 2022 02:59:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/eu-foreign-policy-sanctions-utilizing-eu-criminal-law-powers-to-extend-and-enforce-them/</guid><description>Professor Steve Peers, University of Essex
