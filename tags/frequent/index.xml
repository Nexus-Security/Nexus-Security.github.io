Emirates Skywards is now the loyalty program for both Emirates and flydubai, replacing flydubai&amp;rsquo;s OPEN program. This decision builds on the strong partnership between the two airlines, which already includes code-sharing across a wide global network and collaborations in areas like commercial strategies, network planning, and airport operations.
Members of Emirates Skywards can now earn both Skywards miles and tier miles when flying with either airline. They can also use these miles, or a combination of miles and cash, to book flydubai flights* and purchase extras like pre-ordered meals or extra legroom seats.</description></item></channel></rss>
