Later that year, I added the Beolover Remote Commander and have enjoyed using it to play records.
This year, I made another enhancement to my Beogram 4004: a Beolover SyncDrive Platter Motor. I was eager to try it out after reading about it on the Beolover Blog.
My Beogram 4004 was already restored and in regular use, with a perfectly functional DC platter motor restored by Beolover in 2021.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): More RPM Measurements</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-more-rpm-measurements/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Mar 2023 17:15:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-more-rpm-measurements/</guid><description>Following up on the Beogram 4002 (5513) from the previous day, I conducted an overnight RPM (revolutions per minute) performance test using my BeoloverRPM device.
The resulting measurement curve demonstrates excellent performance, typical of DC motor models. It shows minimal fluctuations (less than 0.05%) over time, aligning with the service manual&amp;rsquo;s specifications. The initial upward slope, lasting a couple of hours, is a common trait in the 551x and 552x models.</description></item><item><title>Digital advertising measurement in Singapore is not meeting expectations</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/digital-advertising-measurement-in-singapore-is-not-meeting-expectations/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Feb 2023 23:27:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/digital-advertising-measurement-in-singapore-is-not-meeting-expectations/</guid><description>Source: IAB Singapore.
A new study by the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) Singapore, titled &amp;ldquo;State of Digital Measurement in Singapore,&amp;rdquo; reveals that senior marketers believe digital advertising measurement in Singapore is lagging behind.
The study shows that senior marketers rate the sophistication of digital measurement in Singapore at an average of four out of ten, with ten representing the level of advanced markets. Mobile measurement is identified as the most significant area needing improvement.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): Initial RPM Performance Characterization</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-initial-rpm-performance-characterization/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jan 2023 09:18:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-initial-rpm-performance-characterization/</guid><description>This post follows up on my initial writing about the Beogram 4002 (5513). I used my recently created BeoloverRPM device to assess the unit&amp;rsquo;s RPM performance.
This test clearly showed the suspected rapid speed changes. The graph below displays the RPM over a roughly 24-hour period.
The abrupt negative spikes in the graph indicate that the DC motor and its control system require attention.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5514): RPM Performance Measurement after Restoration of DC Motor and Control System</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5514-rpm-performance-measurement-after-restoration-of-dc-motor-and-control-system/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Aug 2022 23:53:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5514-rpm-performance-measurement-after-restoration-of-dc-motor-and-control-system/</guid><description>Following the restoration of a Beogram 4002 (5514) turntable&amp;rsquo;s DC motor and control system, a 24-hour RPM performance test was conducted using a custom-built RPM monitoring device.
The initial performance, measured before the restoration, revealed noticeable, abrupt drops in RPM, indicating typical wear and tear in the DC motor&amp;rsquo;s brass sleeve bearings. These dips, while moderate in this instance, would have been audible due to their 1% magnitude.
After the restoration, which included rebuilding the motor and replacing RPM-related components, the significant RPM fluctuations were eliminated.</description></item></channel></rss>
