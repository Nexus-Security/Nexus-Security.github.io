Solenoid Oscillates!</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-arrives-from-uk-solenoid-oscillates-/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Mar 2024 13:40:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-arrives-from-uk-solenoid-oscillates-/</guid><description>I recently acquired another Beogram 4000 from the UK. The unit is in fair shape; importantly, the MMC cartridge mount is undamaged and the sensor arm insert is present. The control panel for the cueing and tonearm lift detached during shipping, highlighting the wisdom of securing such parts. Thankfully, the seller had protected the turntable with a durable plastic sheet, preventing any damage. Reattaching the panel should be simple.
Internally, all parts appear to be present:..<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-arrives-from-uk-solenoid-oscillates-/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-arrives-from-uk-solenoid-oscillates-/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beocord 9000: Display Restoration with SMD LEDs</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-display-restoration-with-smd-leds/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jun 2023 20:28:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-display-restoration-with-smd-leds/</guid><description>The Beocord 9000 being restored has a common issue: a faulty 7-segment display. While only one segment was out, these large, early LED displays are a key design element, making repair essential.
This display resembles the Beomaster 8000&amp;rsquo;s frequency display, but they are not interchangeable. The repair process, however, is the same as documented in previous posts.
To begin, PCB #11 and the bezel are removed to access the display for desoldering...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-display-restoration-with-smd-leds/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-display-restoration-with-smd-leds/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000 Arrives!

It needs a little work, but it came with a perfect MMC20EN cartridge â€“ I&amp;rsquo;m listening to Miles Davis on it right now and it sounds incredible!
The outside and dust cover are in great shape, and the platter looks really good too. Here are my initial thoughts:
The control panel is nice (ignore the Sharpie marks under the position indicator for now&amp;hellip;):..<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-arrives-first-impressions-/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-arrives-first-impressions-/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beocord 9000: Peak Program Meter Scale Illumination with a Red/Green LED</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-peak-program-meter-scale-illumination-with-a-redgreen-led/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Aug 2022 03:51:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-peak-program-meter-scale-illumination-with-a-redgreen-led/</guid><description>During the restoration of a Beocord 9000 cassette deck, the light bulb illuminating the peak program meter&amp;rsquo;s dB scale malfunctioned. This common issue stems from the age of the bulbs, as their leads tend to oxidize and break under pressure.
The initial state of the display, lacking illumination for the numbers on the dB scale, is shown below:
The bulb is inserted into a waveguide that distributes light across the scale, with a textured surface behind the numbers for diffusion...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-peak-program-meter-scale-illumination-with-a-redgreen-led/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-peak-program-meter-scale-illumination-with-a-redgreen-led/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
