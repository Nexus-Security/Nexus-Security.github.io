The keypad is now responsive, but the cueing up and down button is overly sensitive and needs further attention.
The RPM panel re-installation was put on hold because the plastic mounting fixtures were cracked, a common issue with Beogram 4002 turntables. I was fortunate that the cracks weren&amp;rsquo;t severe and the fixtures were still usable. To repair them, I used acrylic repair fluid while pressing the pieces together.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): Keypad and RPM Panel</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-keypad-and-rpm-panel/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2024 02:26:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-keypad-and-rpm-panel/</guid><description>Slow response times from the Beogram&amp;rsquo;s control panel buttons pointed to potential oxidation on the keypad contacts. This was confirmed upon opening the keypad assembly, revealing dull key contacts.
The contact pads were unsoldered and removed for a closer look. While they seemed okay, the leaf contacts engaged by the actuators showed signs of oxidation.
To address the oxidation, a fiberglass brush and Deoxit were used, restoring the contacts to a shiny and clean condition.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002: From Oil Cleanup to First Operational Test</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-from-oil-cleanup-to-first-operational-test/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2024 23:30:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-from-oil-cleanup-to-first-operational-test/</guid><description>The Beogram 4002 restoration hit a snag. Although the main board was restored, the presence of rust and corrosion discovered earlier took priority. Addressing rust requires applying neutralizer and paint, which involves drying time between coats, thus delaying the planned reservoir capacitor and output board work.
Images highlighting the most severe rust spots are included.
Despite the significant rust, the turntable&amp;rsquo;s overall condition is good. To combat the rust, three coats of rust neutralizer were applied.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002: Final Tasks, Adjustments &amp; Playing Records</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-final-tasks-adjustments-playing-records/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 00:35:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-final-tasks-adjustments-playing-records/</guid><description>The final steps of a Beogram 4002 Type 5513 restoration project involved addressing corrosion damage and replacing the 5-pin DIN phono plug. Using a helpful audio path diagram, continuity checks were performed from the cartridge connector to ensure proper signal flow.
The replacement phono plug, a REAN model with gold contact pins, was installed, though the tight fit of the rubber boot on the cable posed a minor challenge. As an improvement, a grounding switch was added to the output board, eliminating the need for an external grounding wire.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 Type 5513: Beogram 4002 Bonanza!</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-beogram-4002-bonanza-/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Mar 2024 20:24:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-beogram-4002-bonanza-/</guid><description>We seem to be inundated with Beogram 400x turntable restorations.
Beolover is occupied with multiple projects, and I have two Beogram 4002 Type 5513 projects that I began examining back in February of 2020. In those previous posts, I had sent four Beogram 400x platter motors to Beolover for his restoration expertise. He has since completed those motors, and they are now back in my possession, ready to be used.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): Tangential Arm Assembly Oil Cleanup and Restoration</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-tangential-arm-assembly-oil-cleanup-and-restoration/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Mar 2024 22:11:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-tangential-arm-assembly-oil-cleanup-and-restoration/</guid><description>This Beogram 4002 restoration project continued with a thorough cleaning of the cabinet&amp;rsquo;s interior, focusing on removing oil residue. The tangential arm assembly was detached to access and clean the oil contamination found throughout the unit.
The oil had spread extensively, affecting various components from the arm&amp;rsquo;s mechanics to the switch contacts. The tangential arm position sensor assembly was entirely disassembled for cleaning.
With the old oil removed, the arm assembly restoration and adjustments could begin.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): Second Unit From Houston</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-second-unit-from-houston/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Mar 2024 13:07:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-second-unit-from-houston/</guid><description>A few weeks back, I completed the first of two Beogram 4002 (Type 5513) turntable restorations for a client in Houston. I&amp;rsquo;m now starting work on the second one. Both turntable platters had their motors removed before being sent to Beolover for refurbishment. He has since finished these and documented the process on his blog.
I believe that refurbishing the platter motor is an essential step in any Beogram 400x restoration project.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): Floating Suspension, Reservoir Capacitor &amp; Platter Motor</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-floating-suspension-reservoir-capacitor-platter-motor/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Feb 2024 20:33:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-floating-suspension-reservoir-capacitor-platter-motor/</guid><description>This project is nearing completion.

Here are the parts needed for mounting the floating suspension system back into the cabinet.
The threaded pin&amp;rsquo;s longer section is positioned at the bottom. When attaching the wing-nut, ensure it sits at the very beginning of the thread. I personally position it to allow enough thread for securing the nut while keeping the nut&amp;rsquo;s outer edge aligned with the topmost thread.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 Type 5513: Floating Chassis</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-floating-chassis/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Feb 2024 18:29:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-floating-chassis/</guid><description>This short post will illustrate an intriguing difference in the suspension systems of two Beogram 4002 Type 5513 turntables.
The first Beogram 4002 Type 5513, serial number 1312615, used a stack of concave washers to secure the floating suspension to the top plate. These washers were also present on the bottom lock.
The second Beogram 4002 Type 5513, serial number 1311076, features a slightly different suspension mechanism. This earlier production model employs a single, concave metal piece between the suspension lock and the top plate.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 Type 5513: Inside Work</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-inside-work/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2024 16:16:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-inside-work/</guid><description>My work on restoring a Beogram 4002 turntable from Houston continues, focusing on the internal components this time.

I&amp;rsquo;m truly happy with how this Beogram turned out. Knowing this turntable has been meticulously serviced is a great feeling. It&amp;rsquo;s spotless inside, and Beolover did an exceptional job revitalizing the platter motor.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 Type 5513: Adjusting/Calibrating the Detector Arm Circuit</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-adjustingcalibrating-the-detector-arm-circuit/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Nov 2023 16:24:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-adjustingcalibrating-the-detector-arm-circuit/</guid><description>The Beogram 4002 turntable is nearly ready for use, with most of the necessary adjustments and calibrations finalized.
As planned, the record detection circuit needed adjustment due to a low measurement. Utilizing insights from Beolover&amp;rsquo;s blog post on the Beogram 4002 record detection circuit, the circuit was calibrated to align with the service manual&amp;rsquo;s specifications.
Two components on the main board, 1R26 (a 1MΩ resistor) and 1TR3 (an NPN BC548C transistor), are key in fine-tuning the signal from the record detection circuit.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 Type 5513: Initial Assessment</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-initial-assessment/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Oct 2023 01:30:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-initial-assessment/</guid><description>A Beogram 4002 turntable, dropped off by its long-time owner, appears to have been well-maintained.
The control panel buttons show typical wear from use, but the dust cover is in good condition with only minor marks. The tonearm requires adjustment as it sits too low when the turntable is not in use.
The turntable&amp;rsquo;s interior is very clean, suggesting it was kept in a good environment.
The original washers for the floating suspension lock-down are intact.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 Type 5513: Reinstalling the Floating Chassis Components</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-reinstalling-the-floating-chassis-components/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Sep 2023 21:07:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-reinstalling-the-floating-chassis-components/</guid><description>All the necessary restoration parts for the Beogram 4002 (Type 5513) turntable are now available, marking the start of the reassembly process.

The control panel, RPM indicator panel, and arm position scale were then put back in their respective places.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 Type 5513: Service Manual Checks and Sensor Adjustment for the Third Beogram from Houston</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-service-manual-checks-and-sensor-adjustment-for-the-third-beogram-from-houston/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2023 10:37:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-service-manual-checks-and-sensor-adjustment-for-the-third-beogram-from-houston/</guid><description>The Beogram 4002 restoration is nearing completion, moving from the workbench to the test bench. The final phase involved service manual checks and adjustments, along with calibrating the record detection, arm position, and tracking sensors.
Following a guide, the record detection sensor was calibrated by adjusting the 1TR3 collector voltage to 4 VDC for an empty, spinning platter. This voltage should remain consistent with a record on the platter.
Next, the tangential arm position sensor was adjusted to achieve 5 VDC at the 4IC1 collector when illuminated by the sensor lamp through a transparent part of the position scale.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 Type 5513: Some additions for a previous Beogram project from Houston</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-some-additions-for-a-previous-beogram-project-from-houston/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jun 2023 09:24:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-some-additions-for-a-previous-beogram-project-from-houston/</guid><description>A Beogram 4002 Type 5513 turntable I previously restored in 2018 was returned for a sensor lamp replacement.
