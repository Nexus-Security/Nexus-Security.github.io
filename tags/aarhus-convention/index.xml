Background
The Aarhus Convention is a crucial piece of international law concerning environmental democracy rights. Established in 1998, this UN Convention lays out three procedural rights directly connected to environmental protection: the right to environmental information, the right to participate in environmental decision-making, and the right to legal recourse on environmental issues (the three Aarhus &amp;ldquo;pillars&amp;rdquo;).
The Aarhus Convention Compliance Committee (ACCC), formed in Geneva in 2002, ensures that the legislation of the Convention&amp;rsquo;s Parties aligns with the Convention itself...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/new-discoveries-in-the-mellifera-case-shed-light-on-access-to-environmental-justice-under-the-aarhus-regulation-but-the-underlying-issues-remain-unchanged/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/new-discoveries-in-the-mellifera-case-shed-light-on-access-to-environmental-justice-under-the-aarhus-regulation-but-the-underlying-issues-remain-unchanged/</a></p></description></item><item><title>A missed chance to enhance access to justice in environmental issues: the CJEU's ruling on the applicability of the Aarhus Convention.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-missed-chance-to-enhance-access-to-justice-in-environmental-issues-the-cjeu-s-ruling-on-the-applicability-of-the-aarhus-convention/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2024 15:14:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-missed-chance-to-enhance-access-to-justice-in-environmental-issues-the-cjeu-s-ruling-on-the-applicability-of-the-aarhus-convention/</guid><description>**

The right to access justice is a crucial safeguard for environmental NGOs and citizens, allowing them to contest public authorities&amp;rsquo; decisions that impact the environment and public health. By joining the Aarhus Convention in 2005, the EU acknowledged this right as a pillar of good governance and a key element of the human right to a healthy environment...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-missed-chance-to-enhance-access-to-justice-in-environmental-issues-the-cjeu-s-ruling-on-the-applicability-of-the-aarhus-convention/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-missed-chance-to-enhance-access-to-justice-in-environmental-issues-the-cjeu-s-ruling-on-the-applicability-of-the-aarhus-convention/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Enhancing democratic processes through citizen involvement in policy development: a comparative analysis of the EU, Germany, and the United States</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/enhancing-democratic-processes-through-citizen-involvement-in-policy-development-a-comparative-analysis-of-the-eu-germany-and-the-united-states/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Dec 2022 08:04:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/enhancing-democratic-processes-through-citizen-involvement-in-policy-development-a-comparative-analysis-of-the-eu-germany-and-the-united-states/</guid><description>Susan Rose-Ackerman, a Henry R.
