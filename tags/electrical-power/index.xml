That dream might not materialize. Broadband over Power Line (BPL), as a consumer internet option, appears to be fading. However, despite complaints from amateur radio operators about interference, BPL is not disappearing entirely. Instead, it&amp;rsquo;s transforming into a utility-focused communication system, potentially offering a solution that benefits everyone.
The turning point for BPL may have been the recent news that Current Communications is ending its BPL service in Dallas, initially intended for 2 million homes.</description></item><item><title>Techâ€™s Moo Poo Buy Plan</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/tech-s-moo-poo-buy-plan/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Jan 2023 04:00:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/tech-s-moo-poo-buy-plan/</guid><description>The internet&amp;rsquo;s increasing energy consumption is rapidly becoming a concern. Data centers, responsible for powering websites and online services, are constantly seeking new energy sources as traditional ones dwindle. Surprisingly, livestock, particularly cows, might be the answer.
While it may sound amusing, cow manure possesses the potential to power the internet. Large-scale server farms require substantial energy, and a new approach involves harnessing the bio-energy from animal waste. This process, known as anaerobic digestion, converts manure into biogas, primarily methane, which can then power turbines to generate electricity.</description></item></channel></rss>
