The Amsterdam District Court, solely responsible for handling European Arrest Warrants (EAWs) in the Netherlands, faces a conflict between national and EU laws regarding detention and release. Dutch law mandates the release of a requested individual after 90 days if the court hasn&amp;rsquo;t made a decision on the EAW. However, a 2015 European Court of Justice (CJEU) ruling stated that national courts can extend detention beyond 90 days to ensure conditions for surrender are met...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-european-arrest-warrant-compatible-with-human-rights-can-individuals-be-legally-detained-for-more-than-90-days-before-being-surrendered/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-european-arrest-warrant-compatible-with-human-rights-can-individuals-be-legally-detained-for-more-than-90-days-before-being-surrendered/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The European Union and the Crisis in the Spanish Constitution</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-european-union-and-the-crisis-in-the-spanish-constitution/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 May 2024 11:15:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-european-union-and-the-crisis-in-the-spanish-constitution/</guid><description>Cecilia Rizcallah, Research Fellow at the Belgian National Fund for Scientific Research affiliated both to Université Saint-Louis Bruxelles and Université libre de Bruxelles
Background
For over a month, Spain has been grappling with a constitutional crisis stemming from pro-independence sentiments in Catalonia. These sentiments culminated in an independence referendum held on October 1, 2017, orchestrated by the Catalan government under President Carles Puigdemont. Barcelona claims that 90% of the 43% voter turnout favored independence...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-european-union-and-the-crisis-in-the-spanish-constitution/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-european-union-and-the-crisis-in-the-spanish-constitution/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Has the European Court of Justice shifted from being an offender to a protector of human rights in the context of the European Arrest Warrant?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/has-the-european-court-of-justice-shifted-from-being-an-offender-to-a-protector-of-human-rights-in-the-context-of-the-european-arrest-warrant/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 04:52:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/has-the-european-court-of-justice-shifted-from-being-an-offender-to-a-protector-of-human-rights-in-the-context-of-the-european-arrest-warrant/</guid><description>Steve Peers*
Since its rushed creation after the 9/11 attacks, the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) has become a cornerstone of EU criminal law. It replaces traditional extradition with a streamlined system lacking most of the usual limitations. This has worried critics concerned about potential miscarriages of justice but pleased supporters who appreciate the faster return of more fugitives to face justice.
Despite concerns from some EU countries&amp;rsquo; constitutional courts, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has long dismissed human rights criticisms of the EAW...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/has-the-european-court-of-justice-shifted-from-being-an-offender-to-a-protector-of-human-rights-in-the-context-of-the-european-arrest-warrant/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/has-the-european-court-of-justice-shifted-from-being-an-offender-to-a-protector-of-human-rights-in-the-context-of-the-european-arrest-warrant/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Finally free?

The recent Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decision in the Lanigan case, which deals with prolonged pre-trial detention and the European Arrest Warrant (EAW), is especially noteworthy given the UN&amp;rsquo;s recent statement regarding Julian Assange&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;arbitrary detention.&amp;rdquo; Assange, who is also facing an EAW, presents a unique situation. What can we learn from each of these cases about the intersection of detention length and the EAW?..<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/finally-free-detention-the-european-arrest-warrant-and-julian-assange/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/finally-free-detention-the-european-arrest-warrant-and-julian-assange/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Dear Colleague, Do You Possess Sufficient Independence?

Advocate General Tanchev recently presented his opinion on case C-216/18 PPU. This case involves multiple European Arrest Warrants (EAWs) issued by Polish authorities against an individual, LM, suspected of drug trafficking. The case, brought before the European Court of Justice (ECJ) by the Irish High Court, questions whether an EAW is enforceable if the issuing Member State&amp;rsquo;s conditions contradict the fundamental right to a fair trial due to systemic rule of law issues within its justice system...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/dear-colleague-do-you-possess-sufficient-independence-the-impact-of-systemic-deficiencies-in-a-member-state-s-justice-system-on-the-principle-of-mutual-trust/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/dear-colleague-do-you-possess-sufficient-independence-the-impact-of-systemic-deficiencies-in-a-member-state-s-justice-system-on-the-principle-of-mutual-trust/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Is the CJEU judgment in LM a new era for mutual trust and independence of the judiciary, or just business as usual?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-cjeu-judgment-in-lm-a-new-era-for-mutual-trust-and-independence-of-the-judiciary-or-just-business-as-usual/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Oct 2022 23:01:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-cjeu-judgment-in-lm-a-new-era-for-mutual-trust-and-independence-of-the-judiciary-or-just-business-as-usual/</guid><description>Dr. Agnieszka Frąckowiak-Adamska, Faculty of Law, University of Wroclaw
In the case of C-216/18 PPU LM, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) was asked by an Irish court to consider a significant legal issue facing the EU: how restrictions on judicial independence in one member state impact other EU member states. A series of laws enacted in Poland from 2015 to 2018 has been widely criticized by numerous institutions, both within and outside Poland, for enabling legislative and executive branches to significantly interfere with the judicial process...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-cjeu-judgment-in-lm-a-new-era-for-mutual-trust-and-independence-of-the-judiciary-or-just-business-as-usual/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-cjeu-judgment-in-lm-a-new-era-for-mutual-trust-and-independence-of-the-judiciary-or-just-business-as-usual/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The CJEU has made a ruling on conflicting EU and national law obligations regarding detention time limits.

A recent ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) addressed the conflict between EU and national laws regarding detention periods for individuals subject to a European Arrest Warrant (EAW). Specifically, the case considered whether a longer EU-mandated detention period overrides a shorter national one, and whether unclear national legislation on this matter violates the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-has-made-a-ruling-on-conflicting-eu-and-national-law-obligations-regarding-detention-time-limits-is-this-a-prison-break/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-has-made-a-ruling-on-conflicting-eu-and-national-law-obligations-regarding-detention-time-limits-is-this-a-prison-break/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Dear Daily Telegraph, I am writing to emphasize the importance of the UK choosing to participate in the European Arrest Warrant (EAW).</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/dear-daily-telegraph-i-am-writing-to-emphasize-the-importance-of-the-uk-choosing-to-participate-in-the-european-arrest-warrant-eaw/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jun 2022 01:38:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/dear-daily-telegraph-i-am-writing-to-emphasize-the-importance-of-the-uk-choosing-to-participate-in-the-european-arrest-warrant-eaw/</guid><description>Steve Peers
