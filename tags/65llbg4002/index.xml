Unlike other bulbs I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered, which typically display a dark film on the glass due to filament evaporation, this one was spotless:
This suggests that this particular Beogram was either lightly used or had its bulb replaced previously. As a result, I will not change it. However, the bulb&amp;rsquo;s placement within its compartment is worth noting...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-sensor-arm-light-bulb/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-sensor-arm-light-bulb/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): Power Supply and Replacing the Reservoir Capacitors with a 3D Printed Fixture</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-power-supply-and-replacing-the-reservoir-capacitors-with-a-3d-printed-fixture/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Nov 2023 11:59:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-power-supply-and-replacing-the-reservoir-capacitors-with-a-3d-printed-fixture/</guid><description>It seems Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen made two versions of the Beogram 4002 (5513) with different power supply setups, both designed with a possible CD4 upgrade in mind. The output board could be swapped for one with a pre-amplifier and CD4 decoder. One version powers the CD4 board directly from the main PCB&amp;rsquo;s 30V rail and uses a single 4000uF capacitor.
My Beogram 4002 uses a separate power supply for the CD4 board, with its own transformer winding, bridge rectifier, and 1000uF capacitor...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-power-supply-and-replacing-the-reservoir-capacitors-with-a-3d-printed-fixture/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-power-supply-and-replacing-the-reservoir-capacitors-with-a-3d-printed-fixture/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): Replacing the Speed Indictor Light Bulbs with RGB LEDs</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-replacing-the-speed-indictor-light-bulbs-with-rgb-leds/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2023 11:05:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-replacing-the-speed-indictor-light-bulbs-with-rgb-leds/</guid><description>During the wait for a 3D-printed part for a Beogram 4002 turntable restoration, the author decided to upgrade its speed indicator lights. Using a method from a previous video, they replaced the incandescent bulbs with RGB LEDs for a more authentic look.
The original setup with incandescent bulbs was documented before the upgrade.
The new setup utilizes both the red and green diodes of an RGB LED for a natural appearance, addressing the issue of amber LEDs failing to illuminate red scale markers properly...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-replacing-the-speed-indictor-light-bulbs-with-rgb-leds/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-replacing-the-speed-indictor-light-bulbs-with-rgb-leds/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): Replacing the Electrolytic Capacitors on the PCBs</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-replacing-the-electrolytic-capacitors-on-the-pcbs/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Aug 2023 05:30:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-replacing-the-electrolytic-capacitors-on-the-pcbs/</guid><description>I began restoring a Beogram 4002 (5513) by replacing all the electrolytic capacitors on the printed circuit boards with high-quality 105C capacitors. I made sure to use components from reputable Japanese brands like Nichicon and Rubycon, sourcing them through trusted distributors like Newark and Mouser. The process was straightforward, aside from uncovering a spider web (and its architect) beneath the main PCB. This restoration project also highlighted the existence of at least two different solenoid control circuits within the 5513 series...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-replacing-the-electrolytic-capacitors-on-the-pcbs/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-replacing-the-electrolytic-capacitors-on-the-pcbs/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): Re-Attaching Keypad Segments</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-re-attaching-keypad-segments/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Mar 2023 09:10:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-re-attaching-keypad-segments/</guid><description>My Beogram 4002 (5513) restoration is moving along, and I&amp;rsquo;m currently focusing on aesthetics. The last step was to reattach two keypad sections that had become unglued. The image illustrates the problem:

I connected it to my Beosystem 6000 to test it, but a loud hum started immediately when I turned on the Beomaster 6000.
Upon closer inspection, I discovered that P9 on the printed circuit board was installed backward. This connector isn&amp;rsquo;t polarized, so it can be inserted either way. Fortunately, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t cause damage because the connector doesn&amp;rsquo;t carry any power...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-first-contact-and-test-drive/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-first-contact-and-test-drive/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): Replacing the DIN 5 Cable with a Cable Featuring RCA Plugs</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-replacing-the-din-5-cable-with-a-cable-featuring-rca-plugs/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jan 2023 05:50:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-replacing-the-din-5-cable-with-a-cable-featuring-rca-plugs/</guid><description>I am rebuilding a Beogram 4002(5513) turntable to use with a McIntosh Preamplifier. The standard DIN5 connector on Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen equipment is incompatible, so I am replacing it with RCA connectors for the best shielding and lowest EMI. Direct installation inside the turntable offers superior performance compared to adapters.
For optimal sound, I chose high-quality, open-ended RCA cables from Sounds Heavenly in the UK.

Both corners were cracked, and the plastic washers that guide the sliding mechanism were gone. The first picture shows one of the damaged corners.
