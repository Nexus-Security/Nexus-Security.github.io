This extension was unexpected. Despite the Benn Act, which mandated the Prime Minister to request a three-month extension for EU membership if Parliament failed to approve a withdrawal agreement by October 19, the Prime Minister insisted he would rather resign than comply. Fueled by ambiguous sources within Downing Street, there was persistent speculation that the Benn Act was unconstitutional, riddled with loopholes, would be superseded by emergency powers, or violated EU law.</description></item><item><title>The Legal Implications of Extending EU Membership and Brexit</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-legal-implications-of-extending-eu-membership-and-brexit/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 14:58:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-legal-implications-of-extending-eu-membership-and-brexit/</guid><description>Professor Steve Peers, University of Essex*
*This blog post was updated after the official decision extending EU membership was approved.
With the Brexit deadline of March 29th approaching and no approval for the proposed withdrawal agreement, the European Council convened and agreed to extend the UK&amp;rsquo;s EU membership on March 21st. The UK formally accepted the extension on March 22nd. This raises several legal questions regarding extending EU membership.</description></item><item><title>Ensuring the Smooth Movement of People: Emergency Brake (Part 3)</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ensuring-the-smooth-movement-of-people-emergency-brake-part-3/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2024 14:56:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ensuring-the-smooth-movement-of-people-emergency-brake-part-3/</guid><description>Catherine Barnard and Sarah Fraser Butlin*

Approximately 3.6 million EU citizens and their families reside in the UK.

The Scope of the Agreement
The withdrawal agreement outlines the terms of the UK&amp;rsquo;s exit from the EU but does not define the long-term relationship between the two entities. The future relationship will be negotiated based on a separate political declaration.
Consequences of Non-Ratification
If the withdrawal agreement is not ratified, the UK could leave the EU without an agreement, or potentially remain in the EU.</description></item><item><title>Brexit has not resulted in any legal changes yet, as the Court of Justice of the European Union continues to rule on the execution of European Arrest Warrants issued by the UK before Brexit Day.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/brexit-has-not-resulted-in-any-legal-changes-yet-as-the-court-of-justice-of-the-european-union-continues-to-rule-on-the-execution-of-european-arrest-warrants-issued-by-the-uk-before-brexit-day/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 09:25:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/brexit-has-not-resulted-in-any-legal-changes-yet-as-the-court-of-justice-of-the-european-union-continues-to-rule-on-the-execution-of-european-arrest-warrants-issued-by-the-uk-before-brexit-day/</guid><description>Professor Steve Peers, University of Essex
While there are many legal discussions surrounding the impact of Brexit, the ultimate authority on these matters, at least for the EU, is the EU Court of Justice. The Court&amp;rsquo;s first ruling on Brexit, released today, clarifies the legal standing until Brexit Day and potentially influences the approach after that.
The judgment in the case of RO addressed whether Ireland remained obligated to enforce a European Arrest Warrant (EAW) issued by the UK considering its impending withdrawal from the EU after triggering Article 50 TEU.</description></item><item><title>Brexit must ensure that health is not negatively impacted, which includes ensuring that there are adequate rules in place for medical professional qualifications.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/brexit-must-ensure-that-health-is-not-negatively-impacted-which-includes-ensuring-that-there-are-adequate-rules-in-place-for-medical-professional-qualifications/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Feb 2023 14:30:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/brexit-must-ensure-that-health-is-not-negatively-impacted-which-includes-ensuring-that-there-are-adequate-rules-in-place-for-medical-professional-qualifications/</guid><description>Professor Tamara Hervey from the University of Sheffield argues that a Leave.EU tweet claiming EU regulations unnecessarily extend doctor training is misleading.
Hervey presents four key arguments: Firstly, the UK, as a long-standing EU member, significantly shaped EU medical training standards. While these standards do influence UK medical qualifications, their impact is limited, and the UK has the authority to propose changes. The current system, including the duration of training, reflects the UK&amp;rsquo;s active participation in shaping these regulations.</description></item><item><title>Is the notice to withdraw from the EU being revoked?

Introduction
Is initiating the Article 50 withdrawal process from the EU irreversible, like jumping off a cliff? Or is it more like going shopping, where you can change your mind along the way, in the parking lot, or even inside the store? Perhaps this change of heart might be due to discovering the promised sale doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist, the management is under investigation, and the supposed extensive international food section is just a couple of dusty packages.</description></item><item><title>If the UK remains a member of the EU past May 22nd, it will be necessary for the country to hold European Parliament elections in order to uphold democratic principles.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/if-the-uk-remains-a-member-of-the-eu-past-may-22nd-it-will-be-necessary-for-the-country-to-hold-european-parliament-elections-in-order-to-uphold-democratic-principles/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Dec 2022 04:35:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/if-the-uk-remains-a-member-of-the-eu-past-may-22nd-it-will-be-necessary-for-the-country-to-hold-european-parliament-elections-in-order-to-uphold-democratic-principles/</guid><description>Professor Eleanor Spaventa, Bocconi University
The UK&amp;rsquo;s political climate surrounding Brexit is highly unstable. Prime Minister May&amp;rsquo;s strategy of delaying a decision may or may not work, but it seems to have created a situation where extending Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union is unavoidable. If Parliament approves the Withdrawal Agreement this week, the UK will need more time to implement the necessary legislation before leaving the EU.</description></item><item><title>Is it possible for a Member State to be expelled or suspended from the EU?

The re-election of Hungary&amp;rsquo;s Orban government has led some critics to demand Hungary&amp;rsquo;s expulsion from the EU. This raises questions about the possibility of such an action and the available sanctions the EU can impose on its members.
This post revisits and updates earlier discussions on this topic, focusing on the &amp;lsquo;Article 7&amp;rsquo; process for addressing breaches of the rule of law and other EU values by Member States.</description></item><item><title>Extension and elections: It is important to discuss Article 50.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/extension-and-elections-it-is-important-to-discuss-article-50/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jul 2022 03:00:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/extension-and-elections-it-is-important-to-discuss-article-50/</guid><description>Professors Catherine Barnard (University of Cambridge) and Steve Weatherill (University of Oxford) explore the implications of Article 50, the exit clause for leaving the European Union. While brief and seemingly straightforward, Article 50 leaves much open to interpretation.
The authors begin by outlining the process for extending the two-year withdrawal period, noting that an extension would require unanimous agreement from all EU member states. They suggest that an extension is likely to be granted if requested by the UK, as it would provide additional time for the UK to either pass the necessary legislation to implement the Withdrawal Agreement or prepare for a &amp;ldquo;no-deal&amp;rdquo; Brexit.</description></item></channel></rss>
