The initial evaluation of this unit is detailed in a separate post.
The turntable was first disassembled, revealing the need for bearing lubrication in the platter motor, a common issue in these models. This process typically takes a few days.
While the bearings were being re-lubricated, the intricate carriage mechanism, responsible for raising and lowering the tonearm, was addressed.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): A New Arrival from Tennessee</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-a-new-arrival-from-tennessee/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Dec 2022 20:57:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-a-new-arrival-from-tennessee/</guid><description>A Beogram 4002 (Type 5513) turntable arrived from a Tennessee customer for a complete restoration. The turntable was shipped safely in a Beolover container. This post focuses on the turntable&amp;rsquo;s initial condition upon arrival.
The first photo shows the turntable as it was unpacked.
The dust cover has numerous scratches and a spot that appears to be chemical damage. Replacing the existing cover with a new one from Beoparts-shop in Denmark is recommended, along with a new reproduction of the aluminum strip.</description></item></channel></rss>
