Traditional procurement processes, designed for less dynamic times, involve lengthy steps from identifying needs to service activation, making it difficult to adapt quickly to changing bandwidth requirements.
This problem is exacerbated by legacy telecom services like T1 lines or OC connections, which offer fixed bandwidth levels.</description></item><item><title>HDBaseT Looks To Unseat HDMI</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/hdbaset-looks-to-unseat-hdmi/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Mar 2023 17:17:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/hdbaset-looks-to-unseat-hdmi/</guid><description>HDMI cables, while necessary for digital video, are notoriously expensive and limited in length. Standard network cables, like Cat5e or Cat6, offer a more affordable and longer-reaching alternative. HDBaseT technology may soon bridge this gap, enabling the use of network cables for video transmission.
The HDBaseT Alliance, comprised of industry leaders such as LG, Samsung, Sony, and Valens Semiconductor, is spearheading this development. Their goal is to replace specialized HDMI cables with standard LAN cables, simplifying connections.</description></item><item><title>Your 50 Mbps WAN Bandwidth Options</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/your-50-mbps-wan-bandwidth-options/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2022 22:23:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/your-50-mbps-wan-bandwidth-options/</guid><description>By: John Shepler
The need for 50 Mbps bandwidth has increased due to businesses needing to use cloud services, access remote data centers, transfer large data files, run e-commerce platforms, send high-resolution images, and distribute video content. There are various ways to get 50 Mbps bandwidth connectivity, each with its own benefits and drawbacks.
