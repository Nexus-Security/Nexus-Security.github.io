On January 14th, Advocate General Cruz Villalon presented his legal opinion on the Gauweiler case (C-62/14), which concerns the legality of the European Central Bank (ECB) Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) program.

This case has significant implications for the European Monetary Union&amp;rsquo;s (EMU) constitutional framework, the ECB&amp;rsquo;s role, and the relationship between the German Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) and the Court of Justice of the EU.</description></item><item><title>The Future of Europe: A Preview of the Five Presidents' Report on EMU Completion</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-future-of-europe-a-preview-of-the-five-presidents-report-on-emu-completion/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jun 2022 14:49:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-future-of-europe-a-preview-of-the-five-presidents-report-on-emu-completion/</guid><description>Menelaos Markakis, DPhil student at University of Oxford, Academy of Athens scholar
