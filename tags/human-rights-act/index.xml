David Cameron&amp;rsquo;s recent speech at Chatham House provided more specifics about the UK&amp;rsquo;s demands for renegotiating its EU membership. These demands were summarized in a letter from Cameron to European Council President Donald Tusk.
Cameron also outlined two planned changes to UK law regarding the EU Charter of Rights and potentially the role of UK courts in reviewing EU court decisions. As these changes pertain to domestic law, they don&amp;rsquo;t require negotiation with other Member States unless they potentially violate EU law.</description></item><item><title>Does repealing the Human Rights Act comply with EU law?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/does-repealing-the-human-rights-act-comply-with-eu-law/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Jul 2022 14:12:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/does-repealing-the-human-rights-act-comply-with-eu-law/</guid><description>Steve Peers
