Death is inevitable, and sadly, it can occur during an individual&amp;rsquo;s working years, before they can retire. This leads to the question: can employment rights be passed down as inheritance?
EU law doesn&amp;rsquo;t dictate the specifics of inheritance laws within individual member states.

The EU&amp;rsquo;s Working Time Directive is frequently a source of contention in the UK. However, certain workers, especially those who might not otherwise receive it, appreciate the four weeks of paid annual leave it guarantees. A recent Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruling in the Lock case addressed a crucial question concerning holiday pay calculation for commissioned employees.
Commission often constitutes a significant portion of a worker&amp;rsquo;s earnings, highlighted by Mr...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/salesman-s-vacation-cjeu-provides-clarification-on-holiday-pay-calculation/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/salesman-s-vacation-cjeu-provides-clarification-on-holiday-pay-calculation/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Is the gig economy protected by EU law?

BACKGROUND
The expanding gig economy is sparking debates about working conditions, including issues like working hours, pay, parental leave, and the crucial classification of gig workers. The case of King is the first time the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has ruled on business conduct and worker rights in this sector.
