The VAR Network, managed by Telarus, Inc., connects telecom providers with VARs (Value Added Resellers). VARs typically represent manufacturers of business phone systems, network equipment, video conferencing tools, and similar products. They often handle both sales and service, providing clients with complete solutions and ongoing support.
Many VARs, focused on hardware and software, haven&amp;rsquo;t ventured into selling telephone lines or WAN services, which are crucial for a comprehensive business solution.</description></item></channel></rss>
