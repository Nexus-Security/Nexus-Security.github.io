Similar to how wireless technology changed phone service, it is now impacting broadband data delivery.
Covad, a national provider of T1 and related services, is at the forefront of this change. While they offer traditional wired T1 service in most areas, they&amp;rsquo;ve deployed &amp;ldquo;T1-class wireless broadband&amp;rdquo; in some major cities using pre-WiMAX technology...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/covad-lets-t1-lines-go-wireless/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/covad-lets-t1-lines-go-wireless/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Ethernet over Fixed Wireless Broadband</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-over-fixed-wireless-broadband/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jul 2023 01:04:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-over-fixed-wireless-broadband/</guid><description>Businesses are discovering the advantages of Metro Ethernet over traditional copper and fiber optic cables. However, there&amp;rsquo;s a lesser-known alternative: Ethernet over Fixed Wireless, offering a fast and budget-friendly way to get the bandwidth you need.
Ethernet over Fixed Wireless (EoFW) is distinct from familiar portable or mobile wireless services like WiFi, WiMAX, or LTE. While these offer broadband within a defined area for general, unencrypted use, their bandwidth is limited and shared, resulting in unpredictable connection speeds...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-over-fixed-wireless-broadband/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-over-fixed-wireless-broadband/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Covad and ADTRAN Make Everything Ethernet</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/covad-and-adtran-make-everything-ethernet/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Apr 2023 09:47:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/covad-and-adtran-make-everything-ethernet/</guid><description>The arrival of Carrier Ethernet is generating considerable excitement around IP core networks and Ethernet access solutions. However, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean traditional TDM services are obsolete. DS1 and DS3 circuits can be adapted for Ethernet transport with the right equipment, as demonstrated by Carrier Covad and equipment manufacturer ADTRAN.
Covad is expanding its Ethernet service area using ADTRAN&amp;rsquo;s central office and network termination equipment. With a nationwide core network, Covad serves 44 states and 235 major markets, specializing in business DSL, data T1, fixed wireless, bonded T1, and integrated voice and data solutions...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/covad-and-adtran-make-everything-ethernet/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/covad-and-adtran-make-everything-ethernet/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
