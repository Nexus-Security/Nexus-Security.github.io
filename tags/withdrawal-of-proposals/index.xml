It is a fundamental principle of EU law, as taught to every student of the subject, that the Commission has a near-monopoly on proposing new EU legislation - it is the &amp;lsquo;motor&amp;rsquo; of EU integration. This near-monopoly is often called the Commission&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;right of initiative&amp;rsquo;. But does this right also imply a right to withdraw proposals? And if it does, are there any limitations to this power? These questions were addressed by the CJEU in a significant ruling.</description></item><item><title>Is there a difference this time?

The European Commission recently released its yearly plan, outlining a different approach than previous years. Beyond the typical policy revisions, this Commission aims to introduce fewer new EU initiatives and withdraw more pending proposals.
Is this approach truly different from past Commissions? Comparing this year&amp;rsquo;s plan to those of previous Commissions offers insights.
In 2005, the incoming Barroso Commission put forward 32 pages of proposals, without mentioning any withdrawals.</description></item></channel></rss>
