While private networks offer the highest level of security, they are expensive to build and maintain. Using the public internet is cheaper but raises security concerns.
A fully private network, offering top-notch security and performance, requires significant investment. Building a central hub and connecting each location with dedicated lines like T1 or Ethernet can become very costly, especially with increasing bandwidth demands and staffing for maintenance.</description></item><item><title>Ethernet Internet Is a Reality</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-internet-is-a-reality/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 May 2023 16:47:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-internet-is-a-reality/</guid><description>Internet access has evolved from slow modems, but connecting still requires converting between protocols and Ethernet used in offices. Now, direct Ethernet internet is possible.
Ethernet for internet access is popular in cities, mainly due to cost savings and simpler networking. Called Metro Ethernet or Carrier Ethernet, it extends your network using Ethernet across cities, countries, or to the internet.
Dedicated Internet Access (DIA) is the top choice for businesses, providing exclusive bandwidth unlike shared services like DSL, WiFi, and cable.</description></item><item><title>Why Ethernet is Cheaper</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/why-ethernet-is-cheaper/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Aug 2022 19:44:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/why-ethernet-is-cheaper/</guid><description>You probably know that T1 and DS3 lines have become much cheaper in recent years. But for those who need bandwidth of 10 Mbps or more, there&amp;rsquo;s an even better deal: Ethernet.
While you might know Ethernet as a local area network protocol, it&amp;rsquo;s now a wide area network protocol too. This means your carrier can provide an Ethernet connection that plugs directly into your existing network router or switch. You might see it called Ethernet WAN, Metro Ethernet, Carrier Ethernet, or Ethernet Transport.</description></item></channel></rss>
