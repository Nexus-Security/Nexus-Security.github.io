This high-speed digital connection typically runs on a SONET fiber optic circuit, with the final connection to the customer&amp;rsquo;s location installed and maintained by the local phone company. DS3 is fast, very reliable, and more affordable than ever before. However, there&amp;rsquo;s a new contender â€“ Fast Ethernet.
Fast Ethernet is a standard Ethernet LAN speed that delivers 100 Mbps.</description></item></channel></rss>
