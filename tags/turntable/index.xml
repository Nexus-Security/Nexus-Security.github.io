To prevent damage, I had previously removed the rosewood trim.
The trim is attached to a metal frame that slides in and out to lock and unlock the cabinet. This frame relies on five guide washers, which are commonly broken in Beogram 4002 units. This one was no different. These washers have a unique design, as detailed in a past Beolover blog post...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-some-cabinet-work/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-some-cabinet-work/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002: Polishing the Hood</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-polishing-the-hood/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 16:20:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-polishing-the-hood/</guid><description>My work on restoring the 4002 continues, and today involved polishing the hood â€“ a task that&amp;rsquo;s quite a workout!

This restoration project inspired me to create an updated MkII version of the 4002 Commander, featuring an auto-repeat function similar to the Beogram 8000 and 8002 turntables...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-commander-mkii-remote-control-for-beogram-4002-now-with-integrated-auto-repeat-function/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-commander-mkii-remote-control-for-beogram-4002-now-with-integrated-auto-repeat-function/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Bay Area Beogram 8002: Capacitor Replacement</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/bay-area-beogram-8002-capacitor-replacement/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Aug 2022 18:57:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/bay-area-beogram-8002-capacitor-replacement/</guid><description>In this Beogram 8002 turntable restoration, I began by replacing the capacitors and the phono muting relay.
I started with the two electrolytic capacitors on the floating chassis, which are part of the +5 VDC power supply regulation. I replaced them with WIMA MKS capacitors (for values 4.7uF and under) and high-quality Japanese 105Â°C electrolytic capacitors (for values over 4.7uF).
The old muting relay was replaced with a fully sealed Omron relay...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/bay-area-beogram-8002-capacitor-replacement/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/bay-area-beogram-8002-capacitor-replacement/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Replacing the Light Bulbs in the Control Panel with LEDs</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-replacing-the-light-bulbs-in-the-control-panel-with-leds/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Aug 2022 15:46:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-replacing-the-light-bulbs-in-the-control-panel-with-leds/</guid><description>Following the replacement of the reservoir and motor capacitors in the Beogram 4000, I focused on upgrading the control panel&amp;rsquo;s light bulbs. LEDs offer greater long-term stability and are generally preferable replacements for incandescent bulbs, except in cases where the original circuitry or aesthetics demand otherwise. Given that the control panel&amp;rsquo;s lighting is internal and not directly visible, LEDs are a suitable replacement.
