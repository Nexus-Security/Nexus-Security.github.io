The Philippines Department of Tourism (PDOT), alongside the Clark Development Corporation, announced the upcoming CLARK BIKE TOUR happening in July. This bike tour aims to raise awareness about the significance of health and wellness as a way of life while promoting travel and tourism. It also seeks to highlight Clark as a bike-friendly area.
The event, scheduled for July 30 at the parade ground, anticipates around 400 road bikers, forming 100 teams of four members each, to engage in a non-competitive day-long tour of different attractions within the freeport zone.</description></item></channel></rss>
