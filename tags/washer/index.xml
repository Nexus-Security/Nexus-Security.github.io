The bushing should be located in the opening on the sub-chassis arm on the right.
The first step of the replacement bushing installation is shown here:..<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5503-new-cabinet-guiding-washers-and-transport-lock-bushings/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5503-new-cabinet-guiding-washers-and-transport-lock-bushings/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): Replacement of Degraded Transport Lock Bushings and Missing Cabinet Guiding Washers</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-replacement-of-degraded-transport-lock-bushings-and-missing-cabinet-guiding-washers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Oct 2022 12:09:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-replacement-of-degraded-transport-lock-bushings-and-missing-cabinet-guiding-washers/</guid><description>The Beogram 4002 restoration involved addressing the common issue of fragile orange transport lock bushings and missing cabinet guiding washers. Many Beograms used plastic washers, which are prone to cracking and falling apart. This was evident in the restoration project, as some washers were missing entirely.
To rectify this, five new 3D-printed washers were installed. For aesthetic purposes, using a black washer for the front-center position is recommended to avoid visibility through the gap between the aluminum panel and the plinth...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-replacement-of-degraded-transport-lock-bushings-and-missing-cabinet-guiding-washers/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-replacement-of-degraded-transport-lock-bushings-and-missing-cabinet-guiding-washers/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: A New Arrival From Michigan - A First Look</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-a-new-arrival-from-michigan-a-first-look/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Sep 2022 20:59:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-a-new-arrival-from-michigan-a-first-look/</guid><description>A Beogram 4000 turntable arrived from Michigan for restoration, carefully packaged according to instructions. The aluminum surfaces are in good condition, with one minor dent on the platter&amp;rsquo;s surrounding plate. The platter itself, keypads, and small aluminum plate are also in good shape. However, one corner of the plinth is damaged. Fortunately, replacement plinth panels were included, which will be installed.
The hood has noticeable scratches, primarily on the surface, and should polish well...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-a-new-arrival-from-michigan-a-first-look/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-a-new-arrival-from-michigan-a-first-look/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5523): A New Arrival - A First Look</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5523-a-new-arrival-a-first-look/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Aug 2022 11:39:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5523-a-new-arrival-a-first-look/</guid><description>A Beogram 4002 (5523) turntable arrived in need of repair. The packaging was generally good, but the cartridge was not secured properly for transport. Thankfully, the delicate cantilever was undamaged. The first step was to safely store the cartridge in a specialized MMC cartridge box. These boxes are offered to customers who are shipping their Beograms for restoration and are also available for the MMC1-5 cartridges.
An initial assessment showed that the aluminum panels were in good condition...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5523-a-new-arrival-a-first-look/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5523-a-new-arrival-a-first-look/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Glueing a Delaminated Platter Back Together and Installation of New Cabined Guidance Washers</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-glueing-a-delaminated-platter-back-together-and-installation-of-new-cabined-guidance-washers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jul 2022 22:41:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-glueing-a-delaminated-platter-back-together-and-installation-of-new-cabined-guidance-washers/</guid><description>The Beogram 4000 I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on was unfortunately damaged during shipping due to inadequate packaging by the seller. Because the platter wasn&amp;rsquo;t secured, it moved around and ultimately split into two pieces. The images show the separated top and bottom sections of the platter.
Examining the platter&amp;rsquo;s interior reveals interesting details about its construction. The heavier bottom section of each platter was individually balanced, much like car tires. This involved drilling away small amounts of material from the heavier side, as evidenced by the red pen marks near the drill holes...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-glueing-a-delaminated-platter-back-together-and-installation-of-new-cabined-guidance-washers/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-glueing-a-delaminated-platter-back-together-and-installation-of-new-cabined-guidance-washers/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5503): A New Arrival - First Impressions</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5503-a-new-arrival-first-impressions/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jul 2022 16:29:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5503-a-new-arrival-first-impressions/</guid><description>I recently acquired a Beogram 4002 (5503) for restoration. The 5503 is the North American version of the 5501/5502 models, evident in the non-functional voltage switch included to maintain a consistent appearance.
This Beogram is in excellent overall condition, featuring high-quality veneer on the plinth and a dust cover with typical scratches that can be polished to near-original clarity. Internally, it appears largely untouched, though there are indications of prior work, such as loose bolts in the tracking and tonearm mechanisms...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5503-a-new-arrival-first-impressions/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5503-a-new-arrival-first-impressions/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Adjusting the Tracking Force and Replacing the Strange Original Front Center Cabinet Guiding Washer</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-adjusting-the-tracking-force-and-replacing-the-strange-original-front-center-cabinet-guiding-washer/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2022 03:22:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-adjusting-the-tracking-force-and-replacing-the-strange-original-front-center-cabinet-guiding-washer/</guid><description>My Beogram 4000 restoration is complete, and it&amp;rsquo;s playing beautifully. As I write this, I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying &amp;ldquo;Song for My Father&amp;rdquo; by Horace Silver on a reissue, as original pressings are unfortunately outside my budget these days.
One of the final tasks was refining the Beogram&amp;rsquo;s mechanics. I calibrated the tonearm weight and limits and replaced the guiding washer, which ensures the plinth moves smoothly. The original washer, pictured below, has a design flaw that was later corrected in the Beogram 400x series...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-adjusting-the-tracking-force-and-replacing-the-strange-original-front-center-cabinet-guiding-washer/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-adjusting-the-tracking-force-and-replacing-the-strange-original-front-center-cabinet-guiding-washer/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
