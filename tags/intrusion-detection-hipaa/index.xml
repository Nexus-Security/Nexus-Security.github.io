With more assets to protect, more entry points for threats, and a wider impact from breaches, larger organizations face greater scrutiny from regulatory bodies like HIPAA for healthcare and PCI DSS for finance.

Some large organizations opt to build in-house security teams, but many find that managed security services offer a more cost-effective alternative.</description></item></channel></rss>
