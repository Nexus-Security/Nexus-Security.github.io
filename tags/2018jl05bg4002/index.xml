Although the main board was restored, the presence of rust and corrosion discovered earlier took priority. Addressing rust requires applying neutralizer and paint, which involves drying time between coats, thus delaying the planned reservoir capacitor and output board work.
Images highlighting the most severe rust spots are included.
Despite the significant rust, the turntable&amp;rsquo;s overall condition is good. To combat the rust, three coats of rust neutralizer were applied...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-from-oil-cleanup-to-first-operational-test/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-from-oil-cleanup-to-first-operational-test/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002: Final Tasks, Adjustments &amp; Playing Records</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-final-tasks-adjustments-playing-records/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 00:35:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-final-tasks-adjustments-playing-records/</guid><description>The final steps of a Beogram 4002 Type 5513 restoration project involved addressing corrosion damage and replacing the 5-pin DIN phono plug. Using a helpful audio path diagram, continuity checks were performed from the cartridge connector to ensure proper signal flow.
The replacement phono plug, a REAN model with gold contact pins, was installed, though the tight fit of the rubber boot on the cable posed a minor challenge. As an improvement, a grounding switch was added to the output board, eliminating the need for an external grounding wire...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-final-tasks-adjustments-playing-records/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-final-tasks-adjustments-playing-records/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002: New Project From Houston</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-new-project-from-houston/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Mar 2023 16:16:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-new-project-from-houston/</guid><description>My next project takes me away from Beomaster restorations and back to Beogram turntables. It&amp;rsquo;s great to work on both, so I&amp;rsquo;m excited regardless. A gentleman from Houston entrusted me with two Beogram 4002 Type 5513 turntables he acquired some years ago. As time took its toll, they stopped functioning properly.Â Like many Beogram 4002 owners, he realized he missed listening to his vinyl records and decided to have them restored...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-new-project-from-houston/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-new-project-from-houston/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
