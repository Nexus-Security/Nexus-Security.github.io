However, upon commencing work on the main board, I realized I lacked a couple of 5Kâ„¦ multi-turn trimmers, essential for the 45 RPM and 33 1/3 RPM speed control (labeled 1R14 and 1R15). While I could order the parts, delivery wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be possible until Monday, and I was eager to keep the project moving.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a photo of the Beogram&amp;rsquo;s main board before removal:..<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-main-board-rework-and-start-of-speed-test-3/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-main-board-rework-and-start-of-speed-test-3/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 Type 5513: Recapping the main controller board and the output board</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-recapping-the-main-controller-board-and-the-output-board/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Feb 2023 08:42:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-recapping-the-main-controller-board-and-the-output-board/</guid><description>The main controller and output boards have had their capacitors successfully replaced.
In addition to replacing the electrolytic and tantalum capacitors on the main controller board, the RPM selection relay and both RPM adjustment trimmers were also replaced.

This image highlights two components within the main controller board&amp;rsquo;s record detection circuit that might require further attention and modification. A determination on whether these components need changing will be made after evaluating all the Beogram 4002 photo sensors...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-recapping-the-main-controller-board-and-the-output-board/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-recapping-the-main-controller-board-and-the-output-board/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
