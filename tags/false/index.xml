Upon pressing START, the carriage would begin to move but halt after approximately 20 mm, coinciding with the lights turning off. A few seconds later, the lights would illuminate again, and the motor would operate at 45 RPM. In this state, the carriage could be moved using the &amp;raquo; &amp;laquo; buttons, but the arm lowering function was disabled...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5501-repair-of-a-strange-fault-caused-by-a-shorted-diode-d6/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5501-repair-of-a-strange-fault-caused-by-a-shorted-diode-d6/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): Sudden RPM Changes</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-sudden-rpm-changes/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Aug 2023 14:20:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-sudden-rpm-changes/</guid><description>During testing of a restored Beogram 4002 (5513) turntable, I noticed the RPM drifting over time. Replacing the original RPM relay and the 5k RPM trimmers fixed this issue. However, a new problem arose: infrequent, sudden drops in RPM.
This image shows the original RPM relay on the main PCB:
The relay design I created for the Beogram 4000 also worked in this model. Hereâ€™s the replacement board:
