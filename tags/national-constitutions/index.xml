A major issue for the EU is whether to sign and provisionally implement CETA, the free trade agreement with Canada. How this power is divided between the EU and its Member States is important, as it determines whether individual countries could veto parts or all of the agreement. This situation is complex, potentially hindering the deal&amp;rsquo;s proponents while empowering its critics.</description></item><item><title>Is there a conflict or disagreement between the European Court of Justice and the Danish Constitutional Court?

The Danish Supreme Court recently issued its judgment in the Ajos case, concerning the scope of the EU employment equality Directive and age discrimination. This decision follows a ruling from the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) that provided two paths for the Danish court: interpret national law in harmony with the Directive or disapply conflicting national provisions.</description></item><item><title>The request for a preliminary ruling from the Polish Supreme Court on 2 August 2018 and its implications for the rule of law in Poland: A commentary on the CJEU's involvement.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-request-for-a-preliminary-ruling-from-the-polish-supreme-court-on-2-august-2018-and-its-implications-for-the-rule-of-law-in-poland-a-commentary-on-the-cjeu-s-involvement/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2024 23:00:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-request-for-a-preliminary-ruling-from-the-polish-supreme-court-on-2-august-2018-and-its-implications-for-the-rule-of-law-in-poland-a-commentary-on-the-cjeu-s-involvement/</guid><description>Alicja Sikora, Chair EU Law, Jagiellonian University
As the playwright Eugene Ionesco once said, predictions are only possible after events have occurred.
Last Thursday, the Polish Supreme Court presented the European Court of Justice with a request for a preliminary ruling. This type of request, outlined in Article 267 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, is used to clarify questions regarding EU law. In doing so, the Polish court also paused the enforcement of a Polish law mandating early retirement for Supreme Court justices over 65.</description></item><item><title>Legal Analysis of Article 50(1) TEU: Member States' Right to Decide on Withdrawal from the EU</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/legal-analysis-of-article-50-1-teu-member-states-right-to-decide-on-withdrawal-from-the-eu/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jun 2023 17:06:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/legal-analysis-of-article-50-1-teu-member-states-right-to-decide-on-withdrawal-from-the-eu/</guid><description>Bartlomiej Kulpa, LLM (London), PhD Candidate (Amsterdam) @KulpaBart Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) outlines the process for a Member State to withdraw from the European Union (EU). While seemingly straightforward, the first paragraph of this article raises questions about its interpretation.
Can a Member State unilaterally decide to withdraw under Article 50(1) TEU?
The primary question surrounding the first paragraph of Article 50 TEU is if it permits a unilateral withdrawal decision.</description></item><item><title>Dear Colleague, Do You Possess Sufficient Independence?

Advocate General Tanchev recently presented his opinion on case C-216/18 PPU. This case involves multiple European Arrest Warrants (EAWs) issued by Polish authorities against an individual, LM, suspected of drug trafficking. The case, brought before the European Court of Justice (ECJ) by the Irish High Court, questions whether an EAW is enforceable if the issuing Member State&amp;rsquo;s conditions contradict the fundamental right to a fair trial due to systemic rule of law issues within its justice system.</description></item><item><title>Commentary on the EU/Canada free trade agreement and its implications on the Irish constitution: Costello v The Government of Ireland and Ors [2022] IESC 44</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/commentary-on-the-eu-canada-free-trade-agreement-and-its-implications-on-the-irish-constitution-costello-v-the-government-of-ireland-and-ors-2022-iesc-44/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Mar 2023 02:23:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/commentary-on-the-eu-canada-free-trade-agreement-and-its-implications-on-the-irish-constitution-costello-v-the-government-of-ireland-and-ors-2022-iesc-44/</guid><description>Dr John Cotter, Lecturer in Law, Keele University, UK

Background
The EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), signed in 2016 after five years of talks, came at a critical point in EU trade policy. While trade wasn&amp;rsquo;t central to the Brexit vote earlier that year, prominent Brexit supporters used the EU&amp;rsquo;s slow trade deal progress to argue for a more agile UK that could ratify deals faster.</description></item><item><title>The European Arrest Warrant and the German Constitutional Court: A new development in the legal conversation</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-european-arrest-warrant-and-the-german-constitutional-court-a-new-development-in-the-legal-conversation/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Dec 2022 21:33:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-european-arrest-warrant-and-the-german-constitutional-court-a-new-development-in-the-legal-conversation/</guid><description>Daniel Sarmiento, Professor of EU Law at the University Complutense of Madrid*
The German Constitutional Court (GCC) has issued another impactful ruling, this time concerning fundamental rights. In an order published yesterday, the GCC exercised its authority to review the implementation of a European Arrest Warrant (EAW) from Italy to Germany. The subject, a US citizen convicted in Italy in absentia, argued that his conviction lacked due process and that Italian law provided no recourse for appeal.</description></item><item><title>Is the CJEU judgment in LM a new era for mutual trust and independence of the judiciary, or just business as usual?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-cjeu-judgment-in-lm-a-new-era-for-mutual-trust-and-independence-of-the-judiciary-or-just-business-as-usual/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Oct 2022 23:01:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-cjeu-judgment-in-lm-a-new-era-for-mutual-trust-and-independence-of-the-judiciary-or-just-business-as-usual/</guid><description>Dr. Agnieszka Frąckowiak-Adamska, Faculty of Law, University of Wroclaw
In the case of C-216/18 PPU LM, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) was asked by an Irish court to consider a significant legal issue facing the EU: how restrictions on judicial independence in one member state impact other EU member states. A series of laws enacted in Poland from 2015 to 2018 has been widely criticized by numerous institutions, both within and outside Poland, for enabling legislative and executive branches to significantly interfere with the judicial process.</description></item><item><title>Constitutional Conflict in the European Union: A Jurisprudential Analysis (OUP 2022)</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/constitutional-conflict-in-the-european-union-a-jurisprudential-analysis-oup-2022/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Sep 2022 17:51:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/constitutional-conflict-in-the-european-union-a-jurisprudential-analysis-oup-2022/</guid><description>Ana Bobić, Law Clerk at the Court of Justice of the European Union

It has been almost 60 years since the Court of Justice established that EU law takes precedence. However, this principle still sparks discussions about the EU&amp;rsquo;s constitutional system. Initially, the integration of EU law into national legal frameworks caused tension between the Court of Justice and national constitutional courts. The Court of Justice believes strongly in the importance of EU law&amp;rsquo;s effectiveness and expects all national courts to share this view.</description></item><item><title>The complete text of the Commission Opinion on the Rule of Law in Poland, dated 1 June 2016, is now accessible.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-complete-text-of-the-commission-opinion-on-the-rule-of-law-in-poland-dated-1-june-2016-is-now-accessible/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jul 2022 03:51:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-complete-text-of-the-commission-opinion-on-the-rule-of-law-in-poland-dated-1-june-2016-is-now-accessible/</guid><description>Professor Laurent Pech
Those interested in the rule of law might find the European Commission&amp;rsquo;s unpublished Opinion on the Rule of Law in Poland, adopted June 1, 2016, insightful (see the Annex for the full text).
This post aims to provide context for non-experts. It will briefly outline the instrument used by the Commission to formulate its Rule of Law Opinion and then summarize why the Commission felt compelled to address rule of law concerns in Poland.</description></item><item><title>Mario's feet were pulled out from under him by the BVerfG and the ECB's OMT programme.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/mario-s-feet-were-pulled-out-from-under-him-by-the-bverfg-and-the-ecb-s-omt-programme/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jul 2022 10:50:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/mario-s-feet-were-pulled-out-from-under-him-by-the-bverfg-and-the-ecb-s-omt-programme/</guid><description>By Ioannis Glinavos (@iGlinavos), Senior Lecturer, University of Westminster
The German Constitutional Court (BVerfG) is set to make a significant decision on the European Union&amp;rsquo;s economic and monetary union on June 21st. The court will rule on the Gauweiler case, which concerns the legality of the European Central Bank&amp;rsquo;s (ECB) Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) program. This program, designed to stabilize struggling Eurozone economies, was challenged by plaintiffs questioning its legal foundation.</description></item></channel></rss>
