Introduction
A Bosnian folk song tells the story of a Pasha who died from a severe illness. When his wife heard about his passing, she died from grief. Similarly, now that the UK has chosen to leave the European Union, will the same fate befall data protection laws once the UK exits the EU?
The UK&amp;rsquo;s current data protection law, the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA), incorporates the EU&amp;rsquo;s 1995 Data Protection Directive...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-data-protection-bill-and-uk-eu-data-transfers-a-story-of-brexit-and-data-protection/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-data-protection-bill-and-uk-eu-data-transfers-a-story-of-brexit-and-data-protection/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Returning to the past: Revisiting fundamental data protection principles in the proposed Data Protection Regulation.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/returning-to-the-past-revisiting-fundamental-data-protection-principles-in-the-proposed-data-protection-regulation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jun 2023 01:27:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/returning-to-the-past-revisiting-fundamental-data-protection-principles-in-the-proposed-data-protection-regulation/</guid><description>Steve Peers
The year 2015 is not living up to the futuristic vision presented in the Back to the Future films, particularly with the absence of hoverboards (drones are a disappointing alternative). Instead of establishing a data protection framework suitable for 2015, the Council seems poised to agree on maintaining the core legal principles from 1995 – which are outdated in the context of technology law.
Background
Negotiations regarding the EU&amp;rsquo;s proposed General Data Protection Regulation appear to be nearing their final stages within the Council...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/returning-to-the-past-revisiting-fundamental-data-protection-principles-in-the-proposed-data-protection-regulation/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/returning-to-the-past-revisiting-fundamental-data-protection-principles-in-the-proposed-data-protection-regulation/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The GDPR's right to erasure (also known as the right to be forgotten) - a potential risk of "rewriting history" or an opportunity for individuals to move on from the past.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-gdpr-s-right-to-erasure-also-known-as-the-right-to-be-forgotten-a-potential-risk-of-rewriting-history-or-an-opportunity-for-individuals-to-move-on-from-the-past/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jun 2023 06:23:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-gdpr-s-right-to-erasure-also-known-as-the-right-to-be-forgotten-a-potential-risk-of-rewriting-history-or-an-opportunity-for-individuals-to-move-on-from-the-past/</guid><description>Ketevan Kukava, PhD Student in Law, Tbilisi State University
In today&amp;rsquo;s digital world, where information is readily stored and accessed, managing one&amp;rsquo;s personal data is a complex challenge. Completely removing data from digital platforms, especially once it&amp;rsquo;s publicly accessible, is technologically and practically difficult. The lasting impact of past actions, preserved online indefinitely, raises concerns in the present.
The internet and digitization, while offering unparalleled access to information and content creation tools, present a significant drawback: the loss of control over personal data and the right to be forgotten...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-gdpr-s-right-to-erasure-also-known-as-the-right-to-be-forgotten-a-potential-risk-of-rewriting-history-or-an-opportunity-for-individuals-to-move-on-from-the-past/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-gdpr-s-right-to-erasure-also-known-as-the-right-to-be-forgotten-a-potential-risk-of-rewriting-history-or-an-opportunity-for-individuals-to-move-on-from-the-past/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The Council is making initial progress in reforming EU data protection law.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-council-is-making-initial-progress-in-reforming-eu-data-protection-law/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jan 2023 19:05:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-council-is-making-initial-progress-in-reforming-eu-data-protection-law/</guid><description>Steve Peers
The EU&amp;rsquo;s 1995 data protection rules, laid out in a Directive, are undergoing a major transformation. The Commission has proposed a new Regulation, sparking discussions since early 2012. While negotiations continue, June saw a significant step forward: the Council (composed of EU Member States&amp;rsquo; justice ministers) agreed on its stance regarding the proposal&amp;rsquo;s application outside the EU. This agreement, though partial, provides valuable insight into the negotiation&amp;rsquo;s trajectory...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-council-is-making-initial-progress-in-reforming-eu-data-protection-law/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-council-is-making-initial-progress-in-reforming-eu-data-protection-law/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Recent rulings from the European Court of Justice (ECJ) and the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) have addressed issues related to privacy and data protection in universities.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/recent-rulings-from-the-european-court-of-justice-ecj-and-the-european-court-of-human-rights-ecthr-have-addressed-issues-related-to-privacy-and-data-protection-in-universities/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Oct 2022 21:34:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/recent-rulings-from-the-european-court-of-justice-ecj-and-the-european-court-of-human-rights-ecthr-have-addressed-issues-related-to-privacy-and-data-protection-in-universities/</guid><description>Professor Steve Peers, University of Essex
Privacy and data protection are distinct legal concepts originating from different legal frameworks and adjudicated by separate European courts. However, these concepts often intersect, and the relevant courts, namely the European Court of Justice (ECJ) interpreting EU data protection laws and the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) interpreting the right to privacy within the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), sometimes reference each other&amp;rsquo;s legal precedents and texts...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/recent-rulings-from-the-european-court-of-justice-ecj-and-the-european-court-of-human-rights-ecthr-have-addressed-issues-related-to-privacy-and-data-protection-in-universities/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/recent-rulings-from-the-european-court-of-justice-ecj-and-the-european-court-of-human-rights-ecthr-have-addressed-issues-related-to-privacy-and-data-protection-in-universities/</a></p></description></item><item><title>'The Right to Erase Personal Data': Upcoming EU legislation begins to form</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-right-to-erase-personal-data-upcoming-eu-legislation-begins-to-form/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Aug 2022 01:03:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-right-to-erase-personal-data-upcoming-eu-legislation-begins-to-form/</guid><description>Steve Peers
The strong reaction to the ‘right to be forgotten’ in EU data protection law is focused on the Court of Justice of the European Union&amp;rsquo;s (CJEU) decision in the Google Spain case. This judgment indirectly established the right by interpreting the existing EU data protection directive. However, this ruling&amp;rsquo;s impact could be limited since the EU is in the process of replacing that directive.
The European Commission presented the first draft of the new General Data Protection Regulation in early 2012, and the European Parliament (EP) voted on it this past spring...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-right-to-erase-personal-data-upcoming-eu-legislation-begins-to-form/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-right-to-erase-personal-data-upcoming-eu-legislation-begins-to-form/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
