Building a custom fiber network by installing owned or leased dark fiber is one solution. Another is leasing wavelengths on existing fiber infrastructure.
Your Own Fiber Installing fiber optic cable on your own property provides control over both the physical space and network assets. However, construction costs increase significantly beyond your premises, especially when obtaining right-of-way permissions.</description></item><item><title>Dark Wavelength vs Dark Fiber for 10 GigE</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/dark-wavelength-vs-dark-fiber-for-10-gige/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Mar 2023 22:29:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/dark-wavelength-vs-dark-fiber-for-10-gige/</guid><description>Businesses needing high bandwidth from a Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) often consider dark fiber. A comparable service, dark wavelength (also known as dark lambda), is also worth considering. Let&amp;rsquo;s compare these two options with other common network connections, like point-to-point and MPLS.
What is a Dark Wavelength? While we associate wavelengths with colors of light, a dark wavelength isn&amp;rsquo;t about the absence of color. It&amp;rsquo;s not the same as dark fiber.</description></item><item><title>Dark Fiber Services to 400 Gbps</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/dark-fiber-services-to-400-gbps/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Aug 2022 02:06:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/dark-fiber-services-to-400-gbps/</guid><description>Bandwidth requirements are clearly increasing. Small companies are upgrading from 1.5 Mbps T1 lines to 10 Mbps Ethernet over Copper, while medium-sized companies are moving towards 50 or 100 Mbps connections. Large companies are continuously seeking even faster Gigabit connections.
While bandwidth typically peaks at 5 or 10 Gbps, some providers offer up to 40 Gbps as they transition to 100 Gbps. However, one provider is setting a new standard with 400 Gbps availability.</description></item></channel></rss>
