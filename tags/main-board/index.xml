The main control board needs its capacitors replaced and the RPM relay (along with the RPM trimmers) need attention. Additionally, the output board requires inspection of its phono muting circuit. It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that aside from wiring, the muting relay is the sole electrical part interacting with the phono audio signal. The turntable&amp;rsquo;s electronics mainly manage the platter motor, tangential arm, indicator lamps, and user controls, none of which are part of the audio pathway.</description></item><item><title>A Pair of Beomaster 1900 Receivers for Restoration: Recapping the Main Board and Volume Control Board (Unit #1)</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-pair-of-beomaster-1900-receivers-for-restoration-recapping-the-main-board-and-volume-control-board-unit-1-/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Nov 2022 09:43:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-pair-of-beomaster-1900-receivers-for-restoration-recapping-the-main-board-and-volume-control-board-unit-1-/</guid><description>The main board and volume control board restoration is finished.
Despite the Beomaster 1900 and 2400 receivers having a small footprint, their restoration is deceptively complex. Replacing the numerous capacitors always serves as a reminder of the intricate internal workings.
Upon arrival, the main board appeared as shown:
After replacing the electrolytic and tantalum capacitors, the main board looked like this:
Here&amp;rsquo;s a closer look:
Following my usual practice, I replaced electrolytic and tantalum capacitors with values of 4.</description></item></channel></rss>
