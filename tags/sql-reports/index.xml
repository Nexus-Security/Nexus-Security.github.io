A client asked for a report to identify employees not set up for Denver&amp;rsquo;s occupational tax. We use a specific benefit and deduction code in the system (&amp;ldquo;head tax&amp;rdquo;) instead of the standard local tax functionality.
Finding employees who are set up is simple. The challenge is identifying those who aren&amp;rsquo;t, especially when they have other benefits and deductions.</description></item></channel></rss>
