This signals the potential end of the century-old telephone system, raising the question of what will replace it. VoIP is a strong contender, but not in its current form.
VoIP&amp;rsquo;s strengths lie in its established standards for coding, signaling, and its compatibility with Ethernet data networks. However, its widespread adoption is hampered by incompatible implementations, concerns from wireless carriers about network overload, and inconsistent voice quality on the internet...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-voice-over-mpls-the-new-pstn/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-voice-over-mpls-the-new-pstn/</a></p></description></item><item><title>How to Get Your Business Phones For Free</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/how-to-get-your-business-phones-for-free/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Dec 2023 06:18:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/how-to-get-your-business-phones-for-free/</guid><description>Upgrading your phone system might seem unnecessary if your current one still works, but you could be missing out on valuable features and integration with wireless devices. While this might seem like a luxury, your competitors could be gaining an advantage while you fall behind.
Believe it or not, you can access these advanced features without spending a fortune upfront.

Previously, businesses typically relied on in-house PBX systems to manage their phone networks and utilized ISDN PRI trunk lines for external calls. However, this is changing rapidly.
Two significant trends are emerging: cloud-based hosted PBX telephone systems and SIP trunking. While these technologies complement each other, it&amp;rsquo;s possible to implement SIP trunking without cloud services.
A telephone trunk consists of multiple phone lines grouped together, either physically or electronically...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/sip-trunking-providers-want-your-bandwidth/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/sip-trunking-providers-want-your-bandwidth/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Wireless SIP Trunking</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/wireless-sip-trunking/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 10:24:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/wireless-sip-trunking/</guid><description>Traditionally, business phone lines and dedicated internet relied on physical wires. However, wireless SIP trunking is emerging as a new option.

Airband Communications, a frontrunner in this technology, offers business-class voice services packaged with wireless internet access. This is comparable to a SIP trunk or an integrated voice and data service in the wired world, but Airband&amp;rsquo;s offering presents unique benefits.
Similar to other integrated services, a single connection provides both phone and internet access, only in this case, it&amp;rsquo;s wireless...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/wireless-sip-trunking/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/wireless-sip-trunking/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Why NOT to Buy a New PBX</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/why-not-to-buy-a-new-pbx/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jun 2023 01:35:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/why-not-to-buy-a-new-pbx/</guid><description>Traditionally, businesses dealing with outdated or inadequate phone systems have opted for a complete replacement, known as a “forklift upgrade.” While this provided enhanced performance and capacity, like a brand new car, there&amp;rsquo;s a compelling alternative in today&amp;rsquo;s world: hosted PBX solutions.
Rather than investing heavily in another physical PBX system, consider a hosted PBX, also referred to as Hosted VoIP or PBX in the cloud.

While ordering these services separately remains an option, businesses now have more choices.
Bundled services, offering both phone and internet, often make the most sense for smaller businesses with limited needs and budgets. Two primary bundled options provide cost savings compared to separate services.

Slow network speeds, particularly when connecting to the internet or other company sites, could point to a latency problem. Let&amp;rsquo;s explore how businesses and organizations can achieve faster network connections:
For businesses that rely on high-speed network performance, like high-frequency financial trading, minimizing latency is crucial. Some companies even choose to be in the same building as stock exchanges to be just feet away from servers.
While most applications aren&amp;rsquo;t that demanding, factors like bandwidth, latency, packet loss, and jitter still matter...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-value-of-low-latency-fiber-optic-connections/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-value-of-low-latency-fiber-optic-connections/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
