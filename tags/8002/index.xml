I was curious to see how the AC motor compared to the DC motors found in other models, like the Beogram 8000/8002 with their computer-controlled linear motors. After running the 4000 for 12 hours using my BeoloverRPM device, the results were interesting.
The AC motor demonstrated excellent stability, as evidenced by the graph. However, there was an initial period of drift as both the oscillator and motor warmed up...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-rpm-performance-test/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-rpm-performance-test/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
