Despite favorable financial conditions, declining stock prices and a strengthening yen have contributed to a slight tightening of financial conditions.

The IMF noted that while Singapore&amp;rsquo;s economy remains strong, it is facing challenges from both global and domestic factors.
Singapore&amp;rsquo;s economic growth slowed to 2% in 2015, down from 3.3% in 2014, and was 2.2% in the first half of 2016. While unemployment is still low, job creation slowed significantly in 2015, and inflation has remained negative since late 2014.</description></item><item><title>The IMF emphasizes the importance of AML/CFT for maintaining stability in the financial sector of the Kyrgyz Republic</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-imf-emphasizes-the-importance-of-aml-cft-for-maintaining-stability-in-the-financial-sector-of-the-kyrgyz-republic/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Jul 2022 14:40:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-imf-emphasizes-the-importance-of-aml-cft-for-maintaining-stability-in-the-financial-sector-of-the-kyrgyz-republic/</guid><description>Despite external pressures decreasing and some positive economic signs, the recovery has been modest. Economic growth sped up towards the end of 2016, hitting 3.8% with 0.5% deflation, partly due to a currency appreciation of about 9%. The 2016 deficit was kept to 4.5% of GDP due to controlled spending on less critical items and the rescheduling of some investment projects, even though tax revenue fell short of expectations. Efforts to consolidate the budget should continue to achieve the 2017 fiscal deficit target of 3% of GDP.</description></item></channel></rss>
