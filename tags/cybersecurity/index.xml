The report, Trend Micro Security Predictions for 2015 and Beyond: The Invisible Becomes Visible, anticipates a rise in targeted attacks, specifically in the Asia Pacific (APAC) region. These attacks focus on infiltrating a specific organization to obtain valuable data.
High-profile attacks in the US and China demonstrate that cybercriminals favor these targeted attacks to gather intelligence, including financial data, personal information, classified government data, and intellectual property like blueprints.</description></item><item><title>The Cyber Resilience Act as it relates to the Internet of Things.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cyber-resilience-act-as-it-relates-to-the-internet-of-things/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2024 02:01:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cyber-resilience-act-as-it-relates-to-the-internet-of-things/</guid><description>Mattis van â€™t Schip, PhD candidate, Radboud University
