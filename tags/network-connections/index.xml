As the demand for more bandwidth increases, so do LAN, MAN, and WAN speeds. This puts pressure on both copper and fiber-based telecommunication networks to upgrade their speeds more frequently. Let&amp;rsquo;s examine the options for both traditional TDM (Time Division Multiplexing) and IP (Internet Protocol) networks.
Traditional Copper Telecom Lines
Copper wiring has been the foundation of electronic communication since the telegraph and telephone networks. While the telegraph is obsolete, the telephone is transitioning technologically, with voice becoming a converged network service...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/wan-network-connections-from-copper-to-fiber/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/wan-network-connections-from-copper-to-fiber/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Filling Coverage Gaps With High Quality Business Satellite</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/filling-coverage-gaps-with-high-quality-business-satellite/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Oct 2023 16:41:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/filling-coverage-gaps-with-high-quality-business-satellite/</guid><description>By: John Shepler
Businesses in big cities have it easy when it comes to internet and phone service. There are so many options! But what if your business isn&amp;rsquo;t in a big city? What if you&amp;rsquo;re stuck with slow internet and outdated phone lines? You&amp;rsquo;re not out of luck!
Look Up for Better Options

Let&amp;rsquo;s explore the key factors and uncover potential cost-saving opportunities.
The main difference between on-site and remote data centers, including colocation facilities, lies in how you manage network connections. On-site, you have full control over your local wiring. Off-site, you lease connections through service providers...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-type-of-data-center-connectivity-do-you-need/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-type-of-data-center-connectivity-do-you-need/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Ethernet over Copper Rising Rapidly</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-over-copper-rising-rapidly/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Apr 2023 14:01:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-over-copper-rising-rapidly/</guid><description>Enhanced business environments and productivity gains through automation are pushing businesses towards higher bandwidth network solutions. Instead of simply increasing their current T1 or other line services, smart managers are exploring new technology that delivers more bandwidth at a lower cost. Ethernet over Copper is emerging as a leading WAN network service.
Ethernet over Copper (EoC) is a straightforward concept: it&amp;rsquo;s an Ethernet service delivered through existing twisted pair copper wiring...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-over-copper-rising-rapidly/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-over-copper-rising-rapidly/</a></p></description></item><item><title>100 Business Locations and 1 Bandwidth Bill</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/100-business-locations-and-1-bandwidth-bill/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Mar 2023 19:39:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/100-business-locations-and-1-bandwidth-bill/</guid><description>As businesses expand nationally or even globally, their network connections often develop haphazardly. Managing numerous individual contracts becomes a significant burden, and costs can spiral out of control. It&amp;rsquo;s highly likely that a more streamlined solution could save money.
Instead of tackling this challenge alone, seeking assistance from a specialized company is recommended. Trying to find the optimal combination of providers and service levels on your own is likely to result in an inefficient and costly setup...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/100-business-locations-and-1-bandwidth-bill/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/100-business-locations-and-1-bandwidth-bill/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Why Your Next Wire Should Be Glass</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/why-your-next-wire-should-be-glass/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Aug 2022 11:31:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/why-your-next-wire-should-be-glass/</guid><description>By: John Shepler
The telecommunications and computer networking industries were built upon copper wire technology. While technologies like Cat5e and Cat6 cabling are sufficient for many networking needs, it&amp;rsquo;s worth considering fiber optic solutions for your next connection.
LAN vs. WAN Copper-based Ethernet is effective for short distances, making it suitable for internal networks. Most users don&amp;rsquo;t require speeds exceeding 1000 Mbps. Therefore, installing fiber to individual desktops seems excessive...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/why-your-next-wire-should-be-glass/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/why-your-next-wire-should-be-glass/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The Value of Low Latency Fiber Optic Connections</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-value-of-low-latency-fiber-optic-connections/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Aug 2022 20:03:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-value-of-low-latency-fiber-optic-connections/</guid><description>By: John Shepler
Slow network speeds, particularly when connecting to the internet or other company sites, could point to a latency problem. Let&amp;rsquo;s explore how businesses and organizations can achieve faster network connections:
For businesses that rely on high-speed network performance, like high-frequency financial trading, minimizing latency is crucial. Some companies even choose to be in the same building as stock exchanges to be just feet away from servers.
While most applications aren&amp;rsquo;t that demanding, factors like bandwidth, latency, packet loss, and jitter still matter...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-value-of-low-latency-fiber-optic-connections/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-value-of-low-latency-fiber-optic-connections/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
