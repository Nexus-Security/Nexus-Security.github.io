I. Introduction
Migration has been a constant throughout human history, driven by a range of factors such as political oppression, war, poverty, opportunity, and family reunification. Each migrant&amp;rsquo;s story is unique, and their movement has diverse impacts on society, necessitating a variety of responses...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/strategy-on-immigration-policy-in-the-eu-by-the-commission/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/strategy-on-immigration-policy-in-the-eu-by-the-commission/</a></p></description></item><item><title>EU leaders are avoiding taking significant action to address the migrant crisis.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/eu-leaders-are-avoiding-taking-significant-action-to-address-the-migrant-crisis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Oct 2023 18:58:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/eu-leaders-are-avoiding-taking-significant-action-to-address-the-migrant-crisis/</guid><description>Steve Peers
EU leaders convened yesterday and agreed on a policy to handle the escalating migrant death toll in the Mediterranean Sea. This new policy expands on the recently implemented 10-point plan established by ministers. Notably, some significant last-minute revisions to the initial draft highlight the leaders&amp;rsquo; priorities.
Detailed comments
The leaders&amp;rsquo; statement appears to demonstrate more empathy than the prior 10-point plan. It acknowledges the immense loss of life as a tragedy and prioritizes the prevention of further deaths at sea...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/eu-leaders-are-avoiding-taking-significant-action-to-address-the-migrant-crisis/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/eu-leaders-are-avoiding-taking-significant-action-to-address-the-migrant-crisis/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Is it possible for the UK to choose not to participate in the mandatory EU refugee quotas?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-possible-for-the-uk-to-choose-not-to-participate-in-the-mandatory-eu-refugee-quotas/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 15:58:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-possible-for-the-uk-to-choose-not-to-participate-in-the-mandatory-eu-refugee-quotas/</guid><description>Steve Peers
The EU Commission is anticipated to unveil a new immigration and asylum agenda on May 13th. A pressing issue within this agenda is whether the UK can opt out of mandatory refugee quotas, a question this article will examine.
Leaked portions of the Commission&amp;rsquo;s paper suggest a more ambitious approach to refugee resettlement than EU leaders recently agreed upon. Specifically, the Commission intends to propose mandatory rules for relocating asylum-seekers already within the EU and resettling refugees currently residing in non-EU countries...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-possible-for-the-uk-to-choose-not-to-participate-in-the-mandatory-eu-refugee-quotas/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-possible-for-the-uk-to-choose-not-to-participate-in-the-mandatory-eu-refugee-quotas/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Will the new EU regulations on maritime surveillance be effective in preventing fatalities and push-backs in the Mediterranean?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/will-the-new-eu-regulations-on-maritime-surveillance-be-effective-in-preventing-fatalities-and-push-backs-in-the-mediterranean/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 May 2023 18:36:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/will-the-new-eu-regulations-on-maritime-surveillance-be-effective-in-preventing-fatalities-and-push-backs-in-the-mediterranean/</guid><description>Steve Peers
Introduction
A recently published EU Regulation establishes new guidelines for maritime surveillance and rescue missions coordinated by Frontex, the EU&amp;rsquo;s border agency. This piece examines the potential impact of these rules on migrant deaths in the Mediterranean and the handling of asylum claims from those rescued at sea.
These new regulations are a direct response to ongoing criticisms that the EU shares responsibility for the migrant deaths in the Mediterranean...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/will-the-new-eu-regulations-on-maritime-surveillance-be-effective-in-preventing-fatalities-and-push-backs-in-the-mediterranean/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/will-the-new-eu-regulations-on-maritime-surveillance-be-effective-in-preventing-fatalities-and-push-backs-in-the-mediterranean/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Is the EU's reaction to migrant fatalities focused on safeguarding and stopping them, or is it merely a way to disguise policy laundering?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-eu-s-reaction-to-migrant-fatalities-focused-on-safeguarding-and-stopping-them-or-is-it-merely-a-way-to-disguise-policy-laundering/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Apr 2023 16:01:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-eu-s-reaction-to-migrant-fatalities-focused-on-safeguarding-and-stopping-them-or-is-it-merely-a-way-to-disguise-policy-laundering/</guid><description>Steve Peers
EU foreign and interior ministers recently agreed on a ten-point plan to address the tragic loss of migrant lives in the Mediterranean. While a summit and a new strategy are forthcoming, this initial plan is disappointing. It lacks crucial specifics and prioritizes border control and restrictive measures over aiding migrants facing perilous journeys and seeking safety.
This analysis will examine each of the plan&amp;rsquo;s ten points, followed by a look at the suggested &amp;ldquo;Australian solution&amp;rdquo; and the controversial &amp;ldquo;Christians only&amp;rdquo; approach...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-eu-s-reaction-to-migrant-fatalities-focused-on-safeguarding-and-stopping-them-or-is-it-merely-a-way-to-disguise-policy-laundering/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-eu-s-reaction-to-migrant-fatalities-focused-on-safeguarding-and-stopping-them-or-is-it-merely-a-way-to-disguise-policy-laundering/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The Temporary Protection Directive: A Crucial Element Missing from the European Migration Agenda</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-temporary-protection-directive-a-crucial-element-missing-from-the-european-migration-agenda/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Mar 2023 06:53:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-temporary-protection-directive-a-crucial-element-missing-from-the-european-migration-agenda/</guid><description>Meltem Ineli-Ciger, PhD Candidate, University of Bristol Law School[1]
The European Union&amp;rsquo;s Temporary Protection Directive came into effect in 2001, marking the first EU directive on international protection after the Treaty of Amsterdam&amp;rsquo;s implementation in 1999. This directive provides a practical and streamlined structure for managing mass arrivals of displaced individuals, standardizing and harmonizing the protection they receive. Despite this, the directive has never been put into practice. While the Council contemplated activating it in the early 2000s due to increasing asylum seekers from Iraq and Afghanistan, no action was taken (Klug)...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-temporary-protection-directive-a-crucial-element-missing-from-the-european-migration-agenda/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-temporary-protection-directive-a-crucial-element-missing-from-the-european-migration-agenda/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Is Nigel Farage's claim that the EU's asylum policies will allow in half a million terrorists accurate?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-nigel-farage-s-claim-that-the-eu-s-asylum-policies-will-allow-in-half-a-million-terrorists-accurate/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Dec 2022 11:06:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-nigel-farage-s-claim-that-the-eu-s-asylum-policies-will-allow-in-half-a-million-terrorists-accurate/</guid><description>Steve Peers
Nigel Farage, the UK Independence Party leader, recently asserted that the European Union&amp;rsquo;s response to the migrant crisis could unintentionally allow a large number of terrorists into the EU. He bases this on the threat by ISIS to use smuggling routes to infiltrate the EU and urges David Cameron to block the EU&amp;rsquo;s plans.
These claims lack merit. The EU&amp;rsquo;s approach essentially maintains the existing situation. The current maritime surveillance efforts, while being expanded, may not become full-scale rescue missions...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-nigel-farage-s-claim-that-the-eu-s-asylum-policies-will-allow-in-half-a-million-terrorists-accurate/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-nigel-farage-s-claim-that-the-eu-s-asylum-policies-will-allow-in-half-a-million-terrorists-accurate/</a></p></description></item><item><title>How can the EU address migrant fatalities in the Mediterranean?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/how-can-the-eu-address-migrant-fatalities-in-the-mediterranean/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Aug 2022 15:07:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/how-can-the-eu-address-migrant-fatalities-in-the-mediterranean/</guid><description>The recent tragedies in the Mediterranean Sea have added to the already significant number of migrant deaths. EU officials are responding to this urgent issue, and this is what their response should include.
First, a large-scale search and rescue operation is needed. The EU&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Triton&amp;rsquo; operation, which replaced the Italian &amp;lsquo;Mare Nostrum,&amp;rsquo; is insufficient for saving lives. It was incorrectly assumed that ending &amp;lsquo;Mare Nostrum&amp;rsquo; would deter migrants and reduce deaths...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/how-can-the-eu-address-migrant-fatalities-in-the-mediterranean/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/how-can-the-eu-address-migrant-fatalities-in-the-mediterranean/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
