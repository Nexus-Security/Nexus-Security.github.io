But why is latency suddenly so important, and how can you achieve it?
Latency is the time it takes for data packets to travel between two points. While insignificant on local networks, latency can pose major problems on long-distance WAN connections, especially for applications where speed is critical.
It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that latency and bandwidth are not directly related. You can have slow connections with minimal latency and blazing-fast connections with terrible latency...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/low-latency-wan-options/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/low-latency-wan-options/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Low Latency Fiber Routes To Europe and Asia</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/low-latency-fiber-routes-to-europe-and-asia/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 May 2023 08:56:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/low-latency-fiber-routes-to-europe-and-asia/</guid><description>Numerous American companies establish branches in the UK and Europe, while multinational corporations operate globally. A prevalent solution for connecting these international offices, including cloud services, is low-latency fiber optic routes. The term &amp;ldquo;low latency,&amp;rdquo; once obscure, gained prominence with the shift from traditional phone lines to VoIP. Previously, it primarily described delays in satellite communication.
The question arises: why the emphasis on low-latency fiber routes now? Aren&amp;rsquo;t fiber connections inherently low latency?..<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/low-latency-fiber-routes-to-europe-and-asia/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/low-latency-fiber-routes-to-europe-and-asia/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Low Latency Connections Bridge The Atlantic</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/low-latency-connections-bridge-the-atlantic/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Oct 2022 05:50:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/low-latency-connections-bridge-the-atlantic/</guid><description>The immense volume of data flowing through global fiber optic networks highlights our interconnected world. While intercontinental cables have existed for years, low latency networks are becoming increasingly vital.
High-frequency trading, particularly the use of automated programs, drives the demand for low latency. These programs compete to execute trades milliseconds or even microseconds faster than competitors, a feat impossible for human traders. This speed makes the physical path between traders and exchanges critical, with the delay on this path known as latency...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/low-latency-connections-bridge-the-atlantic/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/low-latency-connections-bridge-the-atlantic/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
