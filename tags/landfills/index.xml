However, a new competitor called &amp;ldquo;clod&amp;rdquo; computing is emerging, boasting even lower costs.
](http://www.sysnito.com/?crid=11591&amp;linkID=145&amp;refid=Telexplainer-Clod)Clod computing minimizes infrastructure expenses by utilizing readily available, discarded computers. Chip-On-A-Shingle, a clod computing startup, defines a &amp;ldquo;clod&amp;rdquo; as a network of interconnected old computers and devices that collectively provide impressive processing power.
This approach is viable due to the abundance of still functional computers being discarded simply because they are outdated...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/clod-computing-challenges-the-cloud/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/clod-computing-challenges-the-cloud/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Save the Cell Phone, Save the World</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/save-the-cell-phone-save-the-world/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Apr 2023 23:55:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/save-the-cell-phone-save-the-world/</guid><description>Cell phones are frequently overlooked as a source of environmental concern, valuable resources, and potential income.
