Inside was a Beogram 4002 (5501) that I had previously restored in 2016. The 5501 model is unique because it represents a short-lived transitional version produced during B&amp;amp;O&amp;rsquo;s shift from the Beogram 4000 to the 4002. Although the 5501 features the analog control system of the 4002 series (unlike the 4000&amp;rsquo;s more sophisticated hard-wired digital logic system, which was sadly simplified in the 4002), it retains the mechanical carriage position switches found in the 4000...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5501-return-of-an-old-friend-from-australia-dead-solenoid-transistor-and-a-carriage-motor-with-a-corroded-lead/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5501-return-of-an-old-friend-from-australia-dead-solenoid-transistor-and-a-carriage-motor-with-a-corroded-lead/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
