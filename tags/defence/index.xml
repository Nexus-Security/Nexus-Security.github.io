Speeches delivered last week by Theresa May and Boris Johnson regarding the UK&amp;rsquo;s future relationship with the EU present a study in contrasts. May&amp;rsquo;s approach was measured and pragmatic, advocating for close ties, while Johnson&amp;rsquo;s came across as dismissive and lacking depth, favoring distance from the EU.
While the EU27 has begun drafting treaty texts for Brexit, the UK has not. To illustrate potential outcomes, this post includes draft treaties based on Johnson&amp;rsquo;s and May&amp;rsquo;s security proposals.</description></item><item><title>Could the EU be considering the formation of a military force, and would the UK have the power to block it?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/could-the-eu-be-considering-the-formation-of-a-military-force-and-would-the-uk-have-the-power-to-block-it/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jun 2023 05:57:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/could-the-eu-be-considering-the-formation-of-a-military-force-and-would-the-uk-have-the-power-to-block-it/</guid><description>Steve Peers
Recent discussions have centered around whether the EU is forming an army and if the UK has the power to veto such a move before Brexit. This debate, while heated, often lacks clarity. This piece aims to provide a clear understanding of the situation, concluding that the recent proposals don&amp;rsquo;t constitute an EU army, making a UK veto irrelevant.
Background
The EU&amp;rsquo;s foreign policy initially avoided defense matters, respecting Irish neutrality and the UK&amp;rsquo;s commitment to NATO.</description></item><item><title>Is there another accountability gap with the European Peace Facility?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-there-another-accountability-gap-with-the-european-peace-facility/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Nov 2022 12:49:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-there-another-accountability-gap-with-the-european-peace-facility/</guid><description>Ellen Cantraine, PhD researcher, Ghent European Law Institute

Introduction
Following the 2021 coup attempt in Mali, the EU&amp;rsquo;s mission in Mali (EUTM) continued operating despite concerning reports of serious misconduct by EU-trained soldiers. Funded by the European Peace Facility (EPF), EUTM&amp;rsquo;s case exposed significant flaws in the EU&amp;rsquo;s external funding mechanisms.</description></item></channel></rss>
