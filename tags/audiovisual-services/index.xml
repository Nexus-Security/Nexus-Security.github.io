Journalists face various pressures. Recent years have seen media freedom, particularly media pluralism, under threat.
On December 15, 2023, the European Council and Parliament reached an agreement on regulations to protect media freedom, pluralism, and editorial independence within the European Union. The EU Media Freedom Act (EMFA) aims for greater transparency in media ownership and safeguards against government surveillance and spyware targeting journalists...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-complexities-of-the-new-eu-media-freedom-act/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-complexities-of-the-new-eu-media-freedom-act/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Update of the Directive on Audiovisual Media Services – Platforms for Sharing Videos</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/update-of-the-directive-on-audiovisual-media-services-platforms-for-sharing-videos/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Sep 2023 16:26:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/update-of-the-directive-on-audiovisual-media-services-platforms-for-sharing-videos/</guid><description>Professor Lorna Woods, University of Essex
The Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMSD) has been undergoing revisions since 2016, sparking debate about how to update it for the digital age. While the Council and European Parliament generally agree that video-sharing platforms (VSPs) need some regulation, they differ significantly on the specifics. This disagreement is evident in the ongoing trilogue negotiations, where even accessing agreed-upon positions has proven difficult due to the influence of interest groups concerned about advertising regulations...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/update-of-the-directive-on-audiovisual-media-services-platforms-for-sharing-videos/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/update-of-the-directive-on-audiovisual-media-services-platforms-for-sharing-videos/</a></p></description></item><item><title>ERGA and the Audiovisual and Media Services Directive 2.0: A European Regulators Group without Borders?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/erga-and-the-audiovisual-and-media-services-directive-2-0-a-european-regulators-group-without-borders/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 20:38:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/erga-and-the-audiovisual-and-media-services-directive-2-0-a-european-regulators-group-without-borders/</guid><description>Professor Lorna Woods, University of Essex
In 2014, the European Commission created ERGA to help implement the Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMSD) and support a unified European market. This built upon the existing High Level Group of Regulatory Authorities, established in 2003, which brought national enforcement bodies together twice a year. The goal was to improve collaboration between these authorities to ensure the AVMSD was applied consistently across Europe. This reflects a broader EU trend of forming networks, sometimes including member states, to promote harmonization...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/erga-and-the-audiovisual-and-media-services-directive-2-0-a-european-regulators-group-without-borders/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/erga-and-the-audiovisual-and-media-services-directive-2-0-a-european-regulators-group-without-borders/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Overview of the European Democracy Action Plan</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/overview-of-the-european-democracy-action-plan/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Jul 2022 04:55:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/overview-of-the-european-democracy-action-plan/</guid><description>Professor Lorna Woods, University of Essex
The European Democracy Action Plan (EDAP) is one piece of a larger effort to regulate the online world. Unveiled as a key initiative by Commission President von der Leyen, it joins upcoming legislation like the Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA). These measures signal a change in how the EU approaches internet regulation and raise questions about the EU&amp;rsquo;s authority in this space...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/overview-of-the-european-democracy-action-plan/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/overview-of-the-european-democracy-action-plan/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Commentary on Arlewin v.

The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) ruling of March 1, 2016, in the case of Arlewin v. Sweden examined how EU Regulation 44/2001, which decides which Member State&amp;rsquo;s courts hold jurisdiction over civil and commercial disputes, was used (or misused) by Swedish courts. This case highlighted the limitations of the &amp;lsquo;acte clair&amp;rsquo; doctrine – the idea that national courts don&amp;rsquo;t always need to consult the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on EU law matters...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/commentary-on-arlewin-v-sweden-libel-law-eu-law-and-the-echr/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/commentary-on-arlewin-v-sweden-libel-law-eu-law-and-the-echr/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The proposal by the EU Commission regarding the regulation of media freedom.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-proposal-by-the-eu-commission-regarding-the-regulation-of-media-freedom/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jun 2022 01:33:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-proposal-by-the-eu-commission-regarding-the-regulation-of-media-freedom/</guid><description>Lorna Woods, Professor of Internet Law, University of Essex

In the 2021 State of the Union address, EU Commission President von der Leyen underscored the importance of media independence, stating that Europe needs a law to protect it. The proposed Media Freedom Act (MFA) aims to address this, building upon existing regulations like the Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMSD) and the Digital Services Act (DSA)...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-proposal-by-the-eu-commission-regarding-the-regulation-of-media-freedom/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-proposal-by-the-eu-commission-regarding-the-regulation-of-media-freedom/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
