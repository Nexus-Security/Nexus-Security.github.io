DTCM attributes this surge in tourism to Dubai&amp;rsquo;s prominent position as a regional center for meetings, incentives, conferences, and events (MICE). A prime example was the incentive trip in April that brought in over 14,500 delegates from China alone. Significant business events hosted in the first half of 2014 included Gulfood, the Arabian Travel Market, and Intersec, a major trade show for safety, security, and fire protection in the region.</description></item></channel></rss>
