This surge is driven by consumers embracing plant-based, microorganism-derived, and animal-cell-based alternatives, as highlighted in a report by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and Blue Horizon Corporation (BHC).
Titled Food for Thought: The Protein Transformation, the report projects the alternative protein market to expand from 13 million metric tons annually to 97 million metric tons by 2035, constituting 11% of the global protein market.</description></item></channel></rss>
