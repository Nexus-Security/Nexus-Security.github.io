The motor was dead on arrival, so I opened it up and discovered a broken commutator spring that had been taped on with electrical tape.
Unsurprisingly, the motor wouldn&amp;rsquo;t turn. I also found a broken lead on one of the sensing coils, which should have a resistance of 22 Ohms between the contact terminals.
This break disabled the motor&amp;rsquo;s feedback mechanism.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5523): Restoring the DC Platter Motor</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5523-restoring-the-dc-platter-motor/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 May 2024 16:58:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5523-restoring-the-dc-platter-motor/</guid><description>The Beogram 4002 (5523) restoration continued with a focus on the motor.

Initial inspection showed no obvious external issues.
However, a bench test revealed the rotor was blocked, preventing the motor from spinning.
Upon disassembly, it was evident that someone had previously attempted a repair: the brushes were deformed and a pickup coil pin was broken. Further disassembly revealed a loose and disconnected coil near the missing pin.
To address potential bearing issues, the bearings were submerged in motor oil and a vacuum was applied.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 DC Platter Motor: Some Microsurgery on Disconnected Pickup Coils</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-dc-platter-motor-some-microsurgery-on-disconnected-pickup-coils/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Oct 2022 10:03:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-dc-platter-motor-some-microsurgery-on-disconnected-pickup-coils/</guid><description>I recently obtained a DC platter motor from a Beogram 4002 located in Norway. The motor required repair. The owner had already performed the &amp;lsquo;oil infusion&amp;rsquo; procedure for the Oilite bearings. However, after reassembling and reinstalling the motor into the Beogram, the platter&amp;rsquo;s speed was excessively high and could not be adjusted.
This image displays the motor, without the pulley, in the condition I received it:
Uncontrollably high speed in a DC platter motor usually indicates a problem with one or both of the RPM feedback pickup coils within the motor, assuming the motor control circuit is functioning correctly.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 and 4004 DC Motor Restoration</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-and-4004-dc-motor-restoration/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2022 01:27:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-and-4004-dc-motor-restoration/</guid><description>I recently acquired two DC motors from Beogram 4002 and 4004 turntables located in Denmark.

Disassembly revealed the following:
The two small, donut-shaped brass bearings, visible on the black pad, were submerged in motor oil under a vacuum. Bubbles appeared immediately, indicating the oil infusion process was working.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5501): Repair of 'Knocking' AC Motor</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5501-repair-of-knocking-ac-motor/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Sep 2022 13:57:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5501-repair-of-knocking-ac-motor/</guid><description>I prefer to thoroughly test restored Beograms to ensure they&amp;rsquo;re free of intermittent issues. It&amp;rsquo;s not uncommon for new problems to appear with regular use. This was the case with a recently restored AC motor Beogram 4002 (5501). After playing a few records, I detected a faint knocking sound coming from inside the turntable. Upon removing the aluminum plates, I discovered the knocking synchronized with the AC motor&amp;rsquo;s rotation. Adjusting the motor tilt provided temporary noise reduction, but the knocking always returned, intensifying with each record played until it was noticeable during quieter tracks—an unacceptable issue for a turntable!</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 DC Motor Restoration: Repair of a Damaged Pickup Coil and Oil Infusion</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-dc-motor-restoration-repair-of-a-damaged-pickup-coil-and-oil-infusion/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Aug 2022 14:33:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-dc-motor-restoration-repair-of-a-damaged-pickup-coil-and-oil-infusion/</guid><description>A Beogram 4002 DC platter motor from Australia was sent in for repair. The owner reported the motor always ran at high speed, suggesting a broken RPM feedback coil. Without this feedback, the motor receives maximum power and spins as fast as possible.
Disassembly revealed the motor&amp;rsquo;s brushes were improperly installed and a solder burn marked one terminal. The small pickup coils, responsible for sending an AC voltage proportional to motor RPM, were also examined.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 DC Motor Restoration - The Influence of C10 on RPM Stability</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-dc-motor-restoration-the-influence-of-c10-on-rpm-stability/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jul 2022 10:00:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-dc-motor-restoration-the-influence-of-c10-on-rpm-stability/</guid><description>Another Beogram 4002 DC motor was prepped for restoration.
The process began by removing the bearings for an oil infusion.
The small brass bearings were submerged in motor oil, and a vacuum was applied.
Bubbling indicated that the oil was being drawn into the bearings. These bearings took longer than usual, approximately 48 hours, for the bubbling to cease.
After the bubbling stopped, the bearings were taken out of the oil</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Restoration and Adjustment of AC Platter Motor</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-restoration-and-adjustment-of-ac-platter-motor/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jul 2022 04:38:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-restoration-and-adjustment-of-ac-platter-motor/</guid><description>After restoring the electronics of a Beogram 4000 turntable, attention turned to the AC platter motor. This model features an older pulley design without built-in belt guards, relying instead on separate guards added to the motor mounting posts. These added guards are not essential, as the pulley&amp;rsquo;s shape effectively secures the belt. Motor tilt allows for adjustments to the belt&amp;rsquo;s vertical positioning.
Like the DC motors in later Beogram models, the AC motors can also suffer from dried-out bearings.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 DC Motor Restoration: Oil Infusion of the Bearings and a Shiny New Pulley from Austria</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-dc-motor-restoration-oil-infusion-of-the-bearings-and-a-shiny-new-pulley-from-austria/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jun 2022 21:53:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-dc-motor-restoration-oil-infusion-of-the-bearings-and-a-shiny-new-pulley-from-austria/</guid><description>Another Beogram 4002 DC platter motor in need of repair came to my workshop from Virginia.

Initial examination showed it needed some work.
A bench test confirmed the bearings were squeaking, a common issue. The motor was disassembled to remove the bearings for lubrication.
The bearings were placed in motor oil under a vacuum. This process forces air out of the bearing material and allows oil to penetrate it. After a few days, the bearings were removed from the oil.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): Restoration of DC Platter Motor Bearings with Oil Infusion Under Vacuum</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-restoration-of-dc-platter-motor-bearings-with-oil-infusion-under-vacuum/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jun 2022 01:06:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-restoration-of-dc-platter-motor-bearings-with-oil-infusion-under-vacuum/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m working on restoring a Beogram 4002 (5513) turntable and decided to address the DC motor while it&amp;rsquo;s open. Previously, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t realized the importance of properly lubricating the motor bearings for long-term stability. Simply applying grease provided a temporary fix, but RPM fluctuations would reappear after a few weeks.
This time, I completely disassembled the motor to access the bearings. To ensure proper lubrication, I used a vacuum method with a mason jar and a FoodSaver pump.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): Restoring the DC Motor</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-restoring-the-dc-motor/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jun 2022 23:18:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-restoring-the-dc-motor/</guid><description>Following the reconstruction of the Beogram 4002 (5513)&amp;rsquo;s arm lowering and tracking mechanisms, I shifted my focus to the electronics, starting with the motor. While the turntable&amp;rsquo;s RPM stability was excellent, I believe a thorough restoration involves servicing every part, including the motor, to ensure long-term reliability and everyday usability.
The initial step involved extracting the motor from its housing:
Next, I removed the motor from its noise shield:
