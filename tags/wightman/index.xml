The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruling in the Wightman case offers valuable insights into the Brexit process. The Court affirmed that the UK could unilaterally withdraw its intention to leave the EU, without needing approval from the remaining 27 EU members.
While this is a significant development that could empower those advocating for a second referendum with the option to remain in the EU, the CJEU ruling is ultimately inadequate...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/brexit-redux-exploring-the-legal-complexities-of-retracting-the-eu-departure-notification-and-subsequently-re-notifying-the-intention-to-leave/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/brexit-redux-exploring-the-legal-complexities-of-retracting-the-eu-departure-notification-and-subsequently-re-notifying-the-intention-to-leave/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Putting an end to Brexit?

As the deadline for Brexit approaches and Theresa May&amp;rsquo;s conflicting negotiating goals become clearer, there are increasing demands for transparency regarding the Brexit process.
In late 2017, seven Scottish politicians from different parties and legislative bodies in Scotland (the Scottish Parliament, the UK Parliament, and the European Parliament) initiated a legal case in the Scottish Court of Session...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/putting-an-end-to-brexit-explaining-the-wightman-case-on-reversing-the-article-50-notification-independently/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/putting-an-end-to-brexit-explaining-the-wightman-case-on-reversing-the-article-50-notification-independently/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Brexit: You have the option to change your mind.

The recent definitive ruling by the Full Court concerning the Wightman case reaffirms the UK&amp;rsquo;s ability to independently revoke its withdrawal notification from the EU under the most flexible terms. This judgment aligns with the non-binding opinion given the previous week by an Advocate-General.
The judgment
The Court dismissed the UK government&amp;rsquo;s claim of the case being hypothetical, emphasizing the imminent involvement of some litigants (who are MPs) in voting on the proposed withdrawal agreement...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/brexit-you-have-the-option-to-change-your-mind-the-cjeu-ruling-in-wightman-allows-for-a-u-turn/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/brexit-you-have-the-option-to-change-your-mind-the-cjeu-ruling-in-wightman-allows-for-a-u-turn/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Is the notice to withdraw from the EU being revoked?

Introduction
Is initiating the Article 50 withdrawal process from the EU irreversible, like jumping off a cliff? Or is it more like going shopping, where you can change your mind along the way, in the parking lot, or even inside the store? Perhaps this change of heart might be due to discovering the promised sale doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist, the management is under investigation, and the supposed extensive international food section is just a couple of dusty packages...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-notice-to-withdraw-from-the-eu-being-revoked-wightman-s-opinion-suggests-so/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-notice-to-withdraw-from-the-eu-being-revoked-wightman-s-opinion-suggests-so/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
