Taking place in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, India, Thailand, and Cambodia, the competition offers a fantastic chance for companies to form teams and compete in the Corporate Challenge category.
Companies can participate by assembling a team of at least three individuals who register as a group. In contrast to the open and student divisions, corporate teams are evaluated collectively.</description></item></channel></rss>
