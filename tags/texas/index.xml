We believe animal sanctuaries like PAWS and The Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee offer a more humane environment. Our focus is on Queenie, an elephant previously used for rides and performances at the Shrine Circus. Since losing her exhibitor&amp;rsquo;s license, she has been confined in Texas, often tethered to a tree.
We are urging the USDA to relocate Queenie to the spacious PAWS sanctuary in California.</description></item></channel></rss>
