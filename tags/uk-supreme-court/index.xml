Background
Yesterday, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) issued its decision on a case referred by the UK Supreme Court. This case involved the UK&amp;rsquo;s failure to request an extension to meet nitrogen oxide limits as outlined in EU law. The environmental NGO, ClientEarth, brought the case forward in the UK, arguing that the UK was violating Article 13 of Directive 2008/50/EC (the ‘Air Quality Directive’).</description></item><item><title>Does Rottmann Rule apply in the UK?

The UK Supreme Court recently examined the meaning and implications of the CJEU&amp;rsquo;s Rottmann judgment, which deals with EU law limitations on the revocation of national citizenship. The British Home Secretary&amp;rsquo;s legal representative contended that interpreting the judgment beyond cross-border situations would exceed the CJEU&amp;rsquo;s authority. The Court questioned if it could rule on the application of Rottmann before consulting the CJEU, a proposal the Government did not strongly contest.</description></item><item><title>Is this the beginning of the end for citizens' rights in the Brexit 'Sufficient Progress' deal?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-this-the-beginning-of-the-end-for-citizens-rights-in-the-brexit-sufficient-progress-deal/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2024 00:28:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-this-the-beginning-of-the-end-for-citizens-rights-in-the-brexit-sufficient-progress-deal/</guid><description>Professor Steve Peers
The recent joint report on Brexit negotiations, along with accompanying documents, represents an informal agreement to move to the next stage of discussions. This phase will center around a transition period and the framework for the future relationship between the UK and the EU.
Although a political rather than legal document, this report holds significant practical relevance for the withdrawal agreement. It outlines agreed-upon details concerning citizens&amp;rsquo; rights, the Irish border, the financial settlement, and concluding rules.</description></item><item><title>UK Motor Insurance Law in the EU: Road Accidents and Off-Road Responsibilities</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/uk-motor-insurance-law-in-the-eu-road-accidents-and-off-road-responsibilities/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Dec 2023 18:47:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/uk-motor-insurance-law-in-the-eu-road-accidents-and-off-road-responsibilities/</guid><description>James Marson (Reader in Law, Sheffield Hallam University), Katy Ferris (Assistant Professor in Business Law, Nottingham University Business School) and Neil Fletcher (Senior Lecturer, Sheffield Hallam University)
Introduction
While the UK has seen notable legal victories concerning member state liability for breaches of EU law, the ability to hold the state accountable for individual losses remains limited. Establishing a breach significant enough to warrant damages is often a hurdle, except in motor vehicle insurance law.</description></item><item><title>The case of Scotch Whisky Association v Lord Advocate [2017] UKSC 76 demonstrates the appropriateness and necessity of implementing minimum alcohol pricing.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-case-of-scotch-whisky-association-v-lord-advocate-2017-uksc-76-demonstrates-the-appropriateness-and-necessity-of-implementing-minimum-alcohol-pricing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jun 2023 20:36:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-case-of-scotch-whisky-association-v-lord-advocate-2017-uksc-76-demonstrates-the-appropriateness-and-necessity-of-implementing-minimum-alcohol-pricing/</guid><description>Angus MacCulloch, Law School, Lancaster University (@AngusMacCulloch)
The UK Supreme Court, in a long-awaited decision on SWA v Lord Advocate, dismissed the Scotch Whisky Association&amp;rsquo;s (SWA) appeal, allowing the Scottish Government to proceed with its Minimum Unit Pricing (MUP) policy on alcohol sales. This policy, setting a minimum price of £0.50 per unit of alcohol under the 2012 Alcohol (Minimum Pricing)(Scotland) Act, faced a five-year delay due to legal challenges arguing its conflict with EU law.</description></item><item><title>Allister: the impact of the EU Withdrawal Act</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/allister-the-impact-of-the-eu-withdrawal-act/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Mar 2023 18:32:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/allister-the-impact-of-the-eu-withdrawal-act/</guid><description>Anurag Deb, a PhD researcher at Queen&amp;rsquo;s University, explores the legal implications of Brexit on Northern Ireland, particularly focusing on the impact of the EU Withdrawal Act 2018 and the subsequent amendments made by the EU Withdrawal Agreement Act 2020. He argues that the 2020 Act didn&amp;rsquo;t simply maintain the legal status quo as one might expect, but instead partially reversed the intended purpose of the 2018 Act.
This reversal is most evident in Section 7A of the 2018 Act, which incorporates the EU Withdrawal Agreement (including the Northern Ireland Protocol) into UK law.</description></item><item><title>Divergent rulings on Parliament's suspension in England and Scotland</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/divergent-rulings-on-parliament-s-suspension-in-england-and-scotland/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2023 00:21:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/divergent-rulings-on-parliament-s-suspension-in-england-and-scotland/</guid><description>Alan S.

The A-Z of Scots Law: From Avizandum to the Zany Antics of Boris Johnson
Prime Minister Boris Johnson&amp;rsquo;s recent actions are under scrutiny by the Scottish legal system. In the Cherry case, the Scottish court deemed the decision to suspend Parliament unlawful. Further legal action is anticipated regarding the Prime Minister&amp;rsquo;s reported refusal to adhere to the European Union (Withdrawal) (No.</description></item><item><title>Brexit and the Protection of EU Transnational Rights - Part II The Stance of the Supreme Court</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/brexit-and-the-protection-of-eu-transnational-rights-part-ii-the-stance-of-the-supreme-court/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Dec 2022 17:43:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/brexit-and-the-protection-of-eu-transnational-rights-part-ii-the-stance-of-the-supreme-court/</guid><description>Francesca Strumia, Lecturer in Law, University of Sheffield
This piece expands on a previous one concerning the High Court&amp;rsquo;s stance on protecting EU Law-based transnational rights within the context of the Miller case. It examines the Supreme Court&amp;rsquo;s interpretation of the High Court&amp;rsquo;s position and the resulting implications for EU law. The significance of transnational rights persists for two primary reasons. Firstly, beyond the immediate impact on EU and UK citizens facing Brexit-related disruptions, it highlights the fundamental nature of individual rights within the EU legal framework.</description></item><item><title>Can devolved powers help mitigate the negative effects of Brexit on Scotland?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/can-devolved-powers-help-mitigate-the-negative-effects-of-brexit-on-scotland/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Dec 2022 07:18:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/can-devolved-powers-help-mitigate-the-negative-effects-of-brexit-on-scotland/</guid><description>Alan S.

The UK&amp;rsquo;s devolution process, implemented with the understanding of continued EU membership, granted legislative and executive autonomy to Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland through specific Acts of Parliament. These Acts, while establishing varying degrees of autonomy, shared a common thread: devolved powers must not contradict UK&amp;rsquo;s international obligations, particularly EU law.</description></item><item><title>Guardianship, freedom of movement, and child rights: the SM ruling.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/guardianship-freedom-of-movement-and-child-rights-the-sm-ruling/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2022 21:02:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/guardianship-freedom-of-movement-and-child-rights-the-sm-ruling/</guid><description>Professor Steve Peers, University of Essex

Defining a &amp;ldquo;family member&amp;rdquo; legally can be complex, especially when it comes to immigration law and child welfare. The recent Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) judgment in the SM case highlights these complexities, particularly where EU free movement law intersects with the family law of non-EU nations.</description></item><item><title>Is it possible for the ECJ to intervene in Brexit?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-possible-for-the-ecj-to-intervene-in-brexit/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Oct 2022 06:27:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-possible-for-the-ecj-to-intervene-in-brexit/</guid><description>Steve Peers
A recent High Court decision mandates that the UK government must secure parliamentary approval before initiating Article 50, the process for exiting the European Union. While this post won&amp;rsquo;t delve into the national constitutional law aspects, it will examine the potential involvement of EU courts in Brexit disputes.
Following the government&amp;rsquo;s announced appeal to the Supreme Court, some have suggested a further &amp;ldquo;appeal&amp;rdquo; to the European Court of Justice (ECJ).</description></item><item><title>Miller's ruling: Representative Democracy Makes a Comeback</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/miller-s-ruling-representative-democracy-makes-a-comeback/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Sep 2022 12:44:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/miller-s-ruling-representative-democracy-makes-a-comeback/</guid><description>Professor Steve Peers
The UK Supreme Court recently issued its judgment in the Miller case (and a similar Northern Ireland case) regarding the UK&amp;rsquo;s exit from the EU. This post will summarize the judgment&amp;rsquo;s main points and examine its implications for Brexit and Parliament&amp;rsquo;s role. Professor Mark Elliott has already provided a thorough legal analysis, which can be found elsewhere.
The case revolves around two central issues: Parliament&amp;rsquo;s role in initiating Article 50 and the role of devolved legislatures.</description></item><item><title>The case of Elgizouli v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2020] UKSC 10 involves issues related to data protection, the death penalty, and mutual legal assistance in criminal law.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-case-of-elgizouli-v-secretary-of-state-for-the-home-department-2020-uksc-10-involves-issues-related-to-data-protection-the-death-penalty-and-mutual-legal-assistance-in-criminal-law/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Aug 2022 15:07:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-case-of-elgizouli-v-secretary-of-state-for-the-home-department-2020-uksc-10-involves-issues-related-to-data-protection-the-death-penalty-and-mutual-legal-assistance-in-criminal-law/</guid><description>Lorna Woods, Professor of Internet Law, University of Essex
Introduction
The Elgizouli case marks the first UK Supreme Court ruling on the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA). The key takeaway is that simply mostly complying with the Act&amp;rsquo;s requirements isn&amp;rsquo;t enough to legalize data transfers to other countries. This judgment centers around Part Three of the DPA, which puts the Law Enforcement Directive into action and emphasizes procedural safeguards. However, the court&amp;rsquo;s methodology might have broader consequences for how UK courts interpret the DPA and the GDPR, particularly regarding the protection of individual rights outlined in the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).</description></item><item><title>Perhaps we are drawn to the suffering: The conclusion of the legal battle over the Northern Ireland Protocol.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/perhaps-we-are-drawn-to-the-suffering-the-conclusion-of-the-legal-battle-over-the-northern-ireland-protocol/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jun 2022 13:25:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/perhaps-we-are-drawn-to-the-suffering-the-conclusion-of-the-legal-battle-over-the-northern-ireland-protocol/</guid><description>Colin Murray, Law Professor, University of Newcastle

In October 2019, the UK government, led by Boris Johnson, reached a Withdrawal Agreement with the EU. This agreement encompassed a Northern Ireland Protocol iteration based on closely aligned rules governing goods between Northern Ireland and the EU. Notably, no comparable provisions addressed goods regulations for Great Britain. In January 2020, Westminster passed legislation to enact this agreement.</description></item></channel></rss>
