After removing the housing and extracting the photo resistor, a replacement housing was designed and 3D printed.
The new housing consists of two parts. The photo resistor is placed on the insert part after straightening its leads. The main housing is then slid over the insert, sandwiching the photo resistor. This assembly is then inserted into the existing mounting cutouts and soldered to the PCB.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5503): A New Arrival From New Jersey</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5503-a-new-arrival-from-new-jersey/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Dec 2022 02:49:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5503-a-new-arrival-from-new-jersey/</guid><description>I recently acquired a Beogram 4002 (Type 5503) turntable from a collector in New Jersey who was downsizing their collection. This particular model will be restored for a customer who specifically requested a Beogram 4002 with an AC motor.
The turntable arrived securely packaged and in good cosmetic condition, although the dust cover had numerous scratches. I&amp;rsquo;m considering polishing the cover or replacing it with a newly available reproduction.
Upon removing the cover, I noticed the aluminum surfaces were well-maintained, but the keypad had delaminated.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5503): When Disaster Strikes! - Replacement of the Solenoid Switch and Restoration of a Melted Solenoid</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5503-when-disaster-strikes-replacement-of-the-solenoid-switch-and-restoration-of-a-melted-solenoid/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Sep 2022 20:52:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5503-when-disaster-strikes-replacement-of-the-solenoid-switch-and-restoration-of-a-melted-solenoid/</guid><description>It seems my Beogram 4002 customer in Arizona is having arm lowering issues again, just a short time after my last repair in December 2022. Upon opening the unit, I discovered the solenoid had completely melted down due to a faulty arm extension I had previously installed. This prevented the solenoid switch from deactivating, leading to overheating and ultimately, failure.
To fix this, I crafted a new solenoid coil and replaced the melted one.</description></item></channel></rss>
