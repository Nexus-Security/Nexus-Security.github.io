1. Proposal Goals
The European Commission&amp;rsquo;s proposal for an AI Liability Directive, published on September 28, 2022, alongside an updated Product Liability Directive, aims to address the risks posed by artificial intelligence (AI) while acknowledging its potential benefits. The proposal stems from a report recognizing the potential harm AI systems can cause due to their connectivity, unpredictable nature, and opacity, which makes it difficult to assign responsibility for AI-related incidents.</description></item></channel></rss>
