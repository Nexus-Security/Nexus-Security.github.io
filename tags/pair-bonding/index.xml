DS3 often requires fiber optic cable instead of the copper used for T1, and the cost difference is significant.
A simpler solution for a moderate bandwidth boost is adding another T1 line and using &amp;ldquo;pair bonding.&amp;rdquo; This technique combines two lines into one, effectively doubling your bandwidth to 3 Mbps...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/increasing-bandwidth-by-pair-bonding/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/increasing-bandwidth-by-pair-bonding/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Why 10 Mbps Ethernet is Replacing T1</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/why-10-mbps-ethernet-is-replacing-t1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Mar 2023 13:45:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/why-10-mbps-ethernet-is-replacing-t1/</guid><description>A significant technological shift is affecting small and medium-sized businesses, particularly in how they connect to the internet. The traditional T1 line, a long-time staple, is being phased out and replaced with newer technologies.
T1 lines were the first broadband option for businesses, offering a reliable 1.5 Mbps symmetrical bandwidth, a significant improvement over dial-up and slower digital lines. Its initial purpose, developed by Bell Labs, was to carry phone conversations between switching centers...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/why-10-mbps-ethernet-is-replacing-t1/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/why-10-mbps-ethernet-is-replacing-t1/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
