This particular unit was restored for a customer in Australia and also features an internal Beolover RIAA phono pre-amplifier.
The Commander Module, seen here before installation, allows for remote control of the turntable:
The module includes an IR receiver (black wire at the bottom), an adapter board (narrow board on the right), a wiring harness (white wires), and an auto-repeat indicator (red wire at the top)...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5504-installation-of-commander-remote-control-module/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5504-installation-of-commander-remote-control-module/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): Repair of Bent System Ground Terminal</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-repair-of-bent-system-ground-terminal/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Dec 2022 15:31:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-repair-of-bent-system-ground-terminal/</guid><description>Following the installation of my newly designed BeoloverRIAA pre-amplifier into a recently restored Beogram 4002, I prepared to reassemble the casing. As I was about to secure the hood, I discovered the system ground terminal on the rear panel was severely bent and damaged.
The damage to the threads from rust and deformation prevented the nut&amp;rsquo;s removal. I was forced to cut the bolt off. Once removed, I replaced it with a new 3mm bolt and used appropriate insulating shoulder washers...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-repair-of-bent-system-ground-terminal/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-repair-of-bent-system-ground-terminal/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 Commander MkII: Remote Control for Beogram 4002 Now With Integrated Auto-Repeat Function</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-commander-mkii-remote-control-for-beogram-4002-now-with-integrated-auto-repeat-function/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Oct 2022 07:45:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-commander-mkii-remote-control-for-beogram-4002-now-with-integrated-auto-repeat-function/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m working on restoring a Beogram 4002 (5514) turntable and planned to install my 4002 Commander Remote control system. This system is great because it keeps the keypad pristine and allows for operation without touching it. You can find demonstration and installation videos on my blog if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in upgrading your own 4002. The Commander board is compatible with all models equipped with a DC motor.
This restoration project inspired me to create an updated MkII version of the 4002 Commander, featuring an auto-repeat function similar to the Beogram 8000 and 8002 turntables...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-commander-mkii-remote-control-for-beogram-4002-now-with-integrated-auto-repeat-function/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-commander-mkii-remote-control-for-beogram-4002-now-with-integrated-auto-repeat-function/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): Installation of Beolover Commander MkII Remote and Internal RIAA Pre-Amp Board</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-installation-of-beolover-commander-mkii-remote-and-internal-riaa-pre-amp-board/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Aug 2022 09:27:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-installation-of-beolover-commander-mkii-remote-and-internal-riaa-pre-amp-board/</guid><description>The owner of the Beogram 4002 (5513) requested the installation of a 4002 Commander remote control and an internal RIAA pre-amplifier module. The Commander enables complete control of the 4002 using an Apple remote, while the RIAA provides a strong output signal, allowing direct connection to modern amplifiers via CD/DVD/AUX inputs.
