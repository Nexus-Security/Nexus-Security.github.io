This involves nanowires covered in zinc oxide that transform mechanical energy into electrical energy, illustrating the scientific principle of energy conversion.
The creator of this innovation suggests incorporating it into clothing like shirts and shoes to power devices like iPods or medical implants. Currently, the power density is 80 milliwatts per square meter of fabric, but this could increase significantly in the future, potentially reaching several watts per garment, especially with more vigorous movements...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/i-router/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/i-router/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Wireless Internet Access For Farms</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/wireless-internet-access-for-farms/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 May 2024 03:23:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/wireless-internet-access-for-farms/</guid><description>While living and working on a farm has its perks, getting reliable broadband internet can be a challenge. Conventional options like DSL and Cable might not be feasible due to distance limitations, often leaving farms outside their service areas.
Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, there are other solutions for obtaining reasonably priced internet access in rural areas.

But what about businesses in these locations? Do they face similar internet limitations?
In most cases, businesses in rural areas shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be deprived of reliable internet any more than they are deprived of multi-line phone service.

While major providers often only service cities, there are ways to stay connected without spending a fortune or waiting years for expanded infrastructure.
Forget DSL or cable â€“ those are rare finds outside city limits. While universal telephone service guarantees basic phone lines (and thus, very slow dial-up internet), there&amp;rsquo;s a better option for fast, affordable internet: the existing cell phone network...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/alternative-rural-broadband-solution/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/alternative-rural-broadband-solution/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Looking For Spectrum In All The White Spaces</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/looking-for-spectrum-in-all-the-white-spaces/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2024 17:51:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/looking-for-spectrum-in-all-the-white-spaces/</guid><description>With the recent 700 MHz spectrum auction concluded, the wireless industry is feeling a sense of scarcity. All the valuable over-the-air spectrum, much like desirable beachfront property, has seemingly been claimed.
However, instead of viewing the spectrum as fully allocated, consider it as a landscape inhabited by powerful entities, like T-Rexes in the Cretaceous period.

With various technologies like WiFi, DSL, satellite, cable, fiber, and cellular competing for users, the relevance of the once-groundbreaking 56K dial-up is questionable.
It might be surprising to learn that millions of people in the U.S. still use dial-up. These users fall into two groups: those who would switch to broadband if it were affordable and those who use the internet so infrequently that they prefer a free option...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-dial-up-internet-doomed/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-dial-up-internet-doomed/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Rural Broadband Stimulus Hopes To One-Up Dial-up</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/rural-broadband-stimulus-hopes-to-one-up-dial-up/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jun 2023 12:27:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/rural-broadband-stimulus-hopes-to-one-up-dial-up/</guid><description>Right before the 4th of July holiday, the much-awaited government funding plan for expanding rural broadband access was officially announced through a &amp;ldquo;Notice of Funds Availability (NOFA)&amp;rdquo; and a call for applications.

This program aims to bridge the digital divide by providing $7.2 billion in funding to states, enabling them to improve internet access significantly.
While South Korea is making strides in providing gigabit internet speeds to its citizens, many Americans struggle with significantly slower connections. This disparity stems from two main issues. Firstly, rural areas often lack the infrastructure and competition found in metropolitan areas, resulting in limited internet options...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/bandwidth-stimulus-for-the-boonies/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/bandwidth-stimulus-for-the-boonies/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The Next Decade of Bandwidth - Part V</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-next-decade-of-bandwidth-part-v/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Nov 2022 14:06:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-next-decade-of-bandwidth-part-v/</guid><description>While wireless technology is a hot topic, the wired world is also seeing significant advancements.

Access to the internet and even cell phone service is notoriously limited in these areas. While the Rural Broadband Initiative, part of the economic stimulus plan, aimed to address this issue by funding fiber optic cable installation, those funds have unfortunately been redirected.

While metropolitan areas have many choices for broadband internet, rural areas often only have access to limited options like mobile 4G or satellite internet. However, there&amp;rsquo;s another option that is often overlooked but may be a perfect fit for rural businesses and remote work: T1 dedicated internet access.
T1 is Everywhere T1 lines are widely available, often wherever standard phone lines exist. This is because T1 utilizes the same copper wiring infrastructure...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/t1-is-your-rural-broadband-solution/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/t1-is-your-rural-broadband-solution/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Fiber to the Boonies</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/fiber-to-the-boonies/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Aug 2022 22:21:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/fiber-to-the-boonies/</guid><description>For a long time, the idea of &amp;ldquo;rural broadband&amp;rdquo; seemed contradictory. While cities enjoyed a variety of high-speed internet options, from DSL and cable to fiber optic connections, rural areas remained stuck with slow dial-up or satellite internet. Although high-speed business lines have become more affordable, fiber optic cables in rural areas were deemed too expensive. However, an organization in Vermont is challenging this assumption.

However, you might already be able to get the internet speeds your rural business needs.
Most major internet providers have overlooked rural areas, not because rural businesses are less important, but because the cost of installing infrastructure like coaxial cables or fiber optic cables is difficult to recoup when there are fewer customers.
