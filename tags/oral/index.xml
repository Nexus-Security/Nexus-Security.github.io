Consumers are increasingly choosing at-home treatments over professional ones. The firm attributes this shift to the affordability and convenience of oral care products like whitening strips, pens, and trays, which have become popular alternatives to professional whitening procedures.
According to a new Technavio report on the global teeth whitening product market, the industry is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of nearly 4% between 2015 and 2019.</description></item></channel></rss>
