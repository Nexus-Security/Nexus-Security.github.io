After changing the control panel lights, it became obvious that the 45 RPM button lit up the correct trimmer pot but the motor speed didn&amp;rsquo;t change. The issue was a faulty relay that was responsible for switching resistor networks within the Wien oscillator&amp;rsquo;s feedback loop to adjust the resonance frequency.
Finding a replacement relay for vintage electronics can be tricky...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-replacement-of-a-stuck-rpm-relay-with-a-modern-encapsulated-smd-relay/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-replacement-of-a-stuck-rpm-relay-with-a-modern-encapsulated-smd-relay/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Restoration of a Seized Solenoid to Tonearm Linkage</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-restoration-of-a-seized-solenoid-to-tonearm-linkage/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Nov 2022 11:07:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-restoration-of-a-seized-solenoid-to-tonearm-linkage/</guid><description>The Beogram 4000 I got from the UK had a seized linkage connecting the solenoid mechanism and tonearm. To lubricate this linkage, I had to disassemble the sensor arm assembly and remove it. Further inspection showed that the linkage&amp;rsquo;s rotating pin was stuck and had detached from its press-fit socket within the sensor arm base. I&amp;rsquo;ve created a video illustrating the problem and the repair process:..<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-restoration-of-a-seized-solenoid-to-tonearm-linkage/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-restoration-of-a-seized-solenoid-to-tonearm-linkage/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
