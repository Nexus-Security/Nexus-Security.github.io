The author has been working with Visual Basic since the mid-1990s and transitioned to VB.NET in 2007. While the author has experience in C++ and C#, they primarily used VB.NET for its ease of transition. However, after learning about Object-Oriented (OO) application architecture in .NET, the author sees advantages in using C# for OO programming.
Specifically, the author highlights that VB.NET&amp;rsquo;s method of handling Class Constructors, while convenient, can be less intuitive than the C# approach.</description></item></channel></rss>
