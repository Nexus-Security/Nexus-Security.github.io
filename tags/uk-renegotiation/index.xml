Germany&amp;rsquo;s recent exploration of expelling unemployed EU citizens has sparked interest among critics of EU free movement in the UK. As this topic gains traction, it&amp;rsquo;s timely to clarify the circumstances under which EU citizens can be expelled.
While the EU Citizens&amp;rsquo; Directive empowers Member States to expel citizens for reasons related to public policy, security, or health, it explicitly prohibits using these grounds for economic reasons. Consequently, the rules for expelling unemployed EU citizens lie elsewhere within the Directive.</description></item><item><title>In support of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/in-support-of-the-eu-charter-of-fundamental-rights/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Mar 2024 16:06:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/in-support-of-the-eu-charter-of-fundamental-rights/</guid><description>Steve Peers
The UK House of Commons European Scrutiny Committee recently suggested that the UK should create a law to nullify the application of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights within the UK. This proposal has three major flaws.
Firstly, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t actually clarify the uncertainty surrounding the Charter&amp;rsquo;s application, as the committee suggests. Instead, it would create more complexity in how human rights are applied in the UK.</description></item><item><title>Is it possible for a 'fast-track' Treaty amendment on the free movement of workers with the Cameron express?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-possible-for-a-fast-track-treaty-amendment-on-the-free-movement-of-workers-with-the-cameron-express/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jan 2024 10:56:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-possible-for-a-fast-track-treaty-amendment-on-the-free-movement-of-workers-with-the-cameron-express/</guid><description>Steve Peers
Experts in EU law see Treaty amendments as a monumental event. After the Treaty of Lisbon, significant changes to the Treaty seemed improbable in the near future. However, this prospect is becoming more likely due to David Cameron&amp;rsquo;s push to renegotiate free movement regulations within the EU, a sentiment somewhat shared by the UK Labour party.
This brings us to the crucial question of what form such a Treaty amendment would take.</description></item><item><title>Claimants of benefits who are not part of the European Union and the impact on the European Union's relationship with Switzerland.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/claimants-of-benefits-who-are-not-part-of-the-european-union-and-the-impact-on-the-european-union-s-relationship-with-switzerland/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2024 05:37:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/claimants-of-benefits-who-are-not-part-of-the-european-union-and-the-impact-on-the-european-union-s-relationship-with-switzerland/</guid><description>Professor Steve Peers, University of Essex
While it&amp;rsquo;s unlikely to grab sensationalist headlines, a recent Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruling on social security rules for Swiss citizens raises important questions about extending such rules to non-EU countries and the EU&amp;rsquo;s relationship with Switzerland.
Background
This ruling marks the second instance where the UK has challenged the legal basis of Council Decisions concerning the extension of revised EU social security coordination rules to specific non-EU countries.</description></item><item><title>Is the UK's limitation on EU workers' eligibility for benefits lawful - and if not, should it be?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-uk-s-limitation-on-eu-workers-eligibility-for-benefits-lawful-and-if-not-should-it-be/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jan 2024 14:28:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-uk-s-limitation-on-eu-workers-eligibility-for-benefits-lawful-and-if-not-should-it-be/</guid><description>Steve Peers
The UK government recently established a new income requirement for EU citizens from other Member States to be classified as &amp;ldquo;workers&amp;rdquo; and access certain benefits. This raises the question of whether these rules align with EU law regarding the free movement of workers and if modifications are necessary.
Under these regulations, EU citizens must earn a minimum of £150 weekly for at least three months to be considered &amp;ldquo;workers&amp;rdquo; and qualify for benefits such as child benefit, child tax credit, job-seekers&amp;rsquo; allowance, and housing benefit.</description></item><item><title>Briefing 4: Immigration in the EU Referendum</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/briefing-4-immigration-in-the-eu-referendum/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 16:42:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/briefing-4-immigration-in-the-eu-referendum/</guid><description>Steve Peers
Introduction
How does the UK&amp;rsquo;s membership in the European Union (EU) affect immigration and asylum? This piece examines this complex topic, focusing on migration to the UK by both non-EU and EU citizens.
Non-EU migration
It&amp;rsquo;s crucial to differentiate between non-EU and EU migration in the Brexit referendum discussion for two key reasons. Firstly, while EU migration is inherently linked to the UK&amp;rsquo;s EU membership, non-EU migration is not.</description></item><item><title>The immigration issues in the UK renegotiation deal have been finalized.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-immigration-issues-in-the-uk-renegotiation-deal-have-been-finalized/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jul 2023 20:52:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-immigration-issues-in-the-uk-renegotiation-deal-have-been-finalized/</guid><description>Steve Peers*
David Cameron has successfully negotiated a deal regarding the UK&amp;rsquo;s membership in the EU. This post, the first in a series about the deal, focuses on &amp;ldquo;EU immigration&amp;rdquo; or, in terms of EU law, the free movement of EU citizens. I will delve into other important matters (competitiveness, Eurozone relations, sovereignty) and the legal structure of the deal later.
The deal comprises seven legal documents: a Decision by the EU Member States&amp;rsquo; Heads of State and Government (the &amp;ldquo;Decision&amp;rdquo;); a Statement from the Heads of State and Government (an agreed Council Decision); a Declaration by the European Council (representing the EU Member States&amp;rsquo; Heads of State and Government); and four declarations by the Commission.</description></item><item><title>Legal Analysis of Article 50(1) TEU: Member States' Right to Decide on Withdrawal from the EU</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/legal-analysis-of-article-50-1-teu-member-states-right-to-decide-on-withdrawal-from-the-eu/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jun 2023 17:06:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/legal-analysis-of-article-50-1-teu-member-states-right-to-decide-on-withdrawal-from-the-eu/</guid><description>Bartlomiej Kulpa, LLM (London), PhD Candidate (Amsterdam) @KulpaBart Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) outlines the process for a Member State to withdraw from the European Union (EU).

The draft agreement regarding the UK&amp;rsquo;s EU membership has sparked significant debate. While some, mostly within the UK, believe it doesn&amp;rsquo;t go far enough, others, primarily from the remaining EU member states, argue it grants excessive revisions to EU law for a single member state. These are primarily substantive concerns. While I have previously addressed some immigration-related issues within the draft, I will delve into other substantive matters later.</description></item><item><title>Can the EU be reformed without making changes to the Treaties?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/can-the-eu-be-reformed-without-making-changes-to-the-treaties/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 May 2023 03:47:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/can-the-eu-be-reformed-without-making-changes-to-the-treaties/</guid><description>Steve Peers
The UK is about to begin renegotiating its European Union membership, a process some call &amp;ldquo;EU reform.&amp;rdquo; However, several member states have already rejected the idea of treaty changes. So, is a renegotiation or reform package even possible?
While amending secondary EU legislation (or convincingly promising to do so) without altering the treaties is possible, there&amp;rsquo;s always a risk that such changes won&amp;rsquo;t happen or could be reversed later.</description></item><item><title>Is Cameron's speech at Chatham House signaling a strong push for the renegotiation of the UK's EU membership?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-cameron-s-speech-at-chatham-house-signaling-a-strong-push-for-the-renegotiation-of-the-uk-s-eu-membership/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 May 2023 22:24:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-cameron-s-speech-at-chatham-house-signaling-a-strong-push-for-the-renegotiation-of-the-uk-s-eu-membership/</guid><description>Steve Peers
David Cameron&amp;rsquo;s recent speech at Chatham House provided more specifics about the UK&amp;rsquo;s demands for renegotiating its EU membership. These demands were summarized in a letter from Cameron to European Council President Donald Tusk.
Cameron also outlined two planned changes to UK law regarding the EU Charter of Rights and potentially the role of UK courts in reviewing EU court decisions. As these changes pertain to domestic law, they don&amp;rsquo;t require negotiation with other Member States unless they potentially violate EU law.</description></item><item><title>Will Brexit be unavoidable?

The recent Conservative majority win in the UK brings up significant questions regarding the UK&amp;rsquo;s continued membership in the European Union. This piece will initially address concerns surrounding the referendum and the renegotiation process.
The Brexit Referendum
What are the main issues surrounding the approaching referendum?
The new government&amp;rsquo;s plan to renegotiate the UK&amp;rsquo;s EU membership followed by a referendum (Brexit) based on the renegotiation&amp;rsquo;s results by the end of 2017 is paramount.</description></item><item><title>Should the UK continue to vote on its EU membership in an ongoing referendum?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/should-the-uk-continue-to-vote-on-its-eu-membership-in-an-ongoing-referendum/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Mar 2023 20:51:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/should-the-uk-continue-to-vote-on-its-eu-membership-in-an-ongoing-referendum/</guid><description>Steve Peers
A recent news report suggested that individuals campaigning for the UK to leave the European Union in the upcoming referendum are prepared to demand a second referendum if the outcome is to remain. On the surface, this appears to indicate that these &amp;ldquo;Leave&amp;rdquo; supporters anticipate defeat and are planning to contest the result. It&amp;rsquo;s unclear if this is a strategic message for them to promote, but offering strategic advice to the &amp;ldquo;Leave&amp;rdquo; campaign is not my objective.</description></item><item><title>What would be the effect on the UK's relations with the EU if Scotland gained independence?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-would-be-the-effect-on-the-uk-s-relations-with-the-eu-if-scotland-gained-independence/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Feb 2023 00:31:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-would-be-the-effect-on-the-uk-s-relations-with-the-eu-if-scotland-gained-independence/</guid><description>Steve Peers
As the Scottish independence referendum approaches, with the &amp;ldquo;Yes&amp;rdquo; campaign gaining momentum and even leading some polls, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to analyze the potential impact of Scottish independence on the European Union (EU). This analysis will focus on the EU membership of both an independent Scotland and the remaining UK (rUK).
Scottish independence would trigger four significant, near-simultaneous events: negotiations between Scotland and rUK about their future relationship; negotiations for Scotland to rejoin the EU; renegotiation of the UK&amp;rsquo;s EU membership; and a UK general election.</description></item><item><title>Is Juncker capable of being a reformist Commission President, like Nixon was in going to China?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-juncker-capable-of-being-a-reformist-commission-president-like-nixon-was-in-going-to-china/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Feb 2023 22:41:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-juncker-capable-of-being-a-reformist-commission-president-like-nixon-was-in-going-to-china/</guid><description>Steve Peers
A common saying in American politics, &amp;ldquo;only Nixon could go to China,&amp;rdquo; suggests that only a politician with a well-established reputation can persuade their base to accept a major policy shift. Nixon, a staunch anti-Communist, was able to convince American conservatives that engaging with Communist China was in their best interest. This principle might apply to the European Union as well. The recent European Parliament (EP) elections saw a rise in support for anti-EU parties in several Member States.</description></item><item><title>Is it possible for humans to make a legally binding commitment to Treaty change?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-possible-for-humans-to-make-a-legally-binding-commitment-to-treaty-change/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Feb 2023 15:47:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-possible-for-humans-to-make-a-legally-binding-commitment-to-treaty-change/</guid><description>Steve Peers
British Prime Minister David Cameron has surprised many by securing concessions from the EU, such as a smaller EU budget and a Conservative majority in the House of Commons. However, his goal of renegotiating the UK&amp;rsquo;s EU membership raises the question: are his demands even achievable?
This question arises from Cameron&amp;rsquo;s recently confirmed intention to secure not immediate Treaty changes, but rather a &amp;ldquo;legally binding&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;irreversible&amp;rdquo; agreement that would commit to future Treaty changes.</description></item><item><title>The legal status and impact of the UK/EU renegotiation deal.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-legal-status-and-impact-of-the-uk-eu-renegotiation-deal/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jan 2023 14:27:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-legal-status-and-impact-of-the-uk-eu-renegotiation-deal/</guid><description>Is the UK&amp;rsquo;s renegotiated EU membership deal legally binding?

Many drivers have encountered the unfortunate experience of hitting a small animal that darted across the road at the wrong moment. Reactions vary from distress to indifference, but some feel a sense of triumph, having removed an obstacle from their path.
This last reaction mirrors the Conservative party&amp;rsquo;s stance on EU law within their UK human rights law reform proposals. They aim to diminish EU law&amp;rsquo;s influence, much like a driver indifferent to roadkill.</description></item><item><title>Who should have control over the 'emergency brake' on benefits for EU citizens: the Commission or the Council?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/who-should-have-control-over-the-emergency-brake-on-benefits-for-eu-citizens-the-commission-or-the-council/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Nov 2022 22:44:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/who-should-have-control-over-the-emergency-brake-on-benefits-for-eu-citizens-the-commission-or-the-council/</guid><description>Steve Peers, Professor of Law, University of Essex
During the UK&amp;rsquo;s negotiations to leave the European Union, a key point of contention arose: the process for enacting an &amp;ldquo;emergency brake&amp;rdquo; to restrict EU citizens&amp;rsquo; access to in-work benefits. Should a Member State have the authority to implement this measure independently, perhaps with a requirement to inform the Commission and Council? Or should it be required to submit a request, leaving the decision of authorization to the Commission and/or Council?</description></item><item><title>Is the European Union a cause worth sacrificing for?

If British pro-Europeans could travel back in time, their priority should be returning to 2004. They should focus all efforts on persuading the then-British government to reconsider granting immediate free movement of workers from new EU member states. While economically advantageous, this decision has severely damaged public support for EU membership in the UK, as well as for the UK Labour Party.
Today, the free movement of people is often framed as a fundamental flaw within the EU, prompting calls for the UK to either leave or renegotiate its terms.</description></item><item><title>Unemployed EU citizens may benefit from the CJEU's decision, potentially complicating David Cameron's renegotiation strategy.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/unemployed-eu-citizens-may-benefit-from-the-cjeu-s-decision-potentially-complicating-david-cameron-s-renegotiation-strategy/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Oct 2022 18:18:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/unemployed-eu-citizens-may-benefit-from-the-cjeu-s-decision-potentially-complicating-david-cameron-s-renegotiation-strategy/</guid><description>Steve Peers
The ability of EU citizens to move freely between Member States, often referred to as ‘immigration,’ has sparked significant political debate, particularly in the UK. Access to benefits for these individuals remains a point of contention.

The UK&amp;rsquo;s new government plans to revoke its Human Rights Act (HRA), a move with legal and political ramifications. While the overlap with EU law is complex, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to examine the potential conflicts and consequences.
Assuming the UK remains part of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and doesn&amp;rsquo;t intend to disapply the EU Charter of Rights domestically, the government&amp;rsquo;s objective seems to be weakening domestic human rights protection and separating it from the ECHR, potentially impacting groups considered undesirable.</description></item><item><title>Is it possible to renegotiate the UK's membership of the EU?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-possible-to-renegotiate-the-uk-s-membership-of-the-eu/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jul 2022 03:14:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-possible-to-renegotiate-the-uk-s-membership-of-the-eu/</guid><description>Steve Peers
Can the UK renegotiate its EU membership terms? This question is easier to answer after analyzing David Cameron&amp;rsquo;s stated objectives for such a renegotiation.
The Telegraph summarized these objectives into seven key points, which we will examine individually.
Firstly, limiting the movement of people from countries joining the EU in the future. This wouldn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily require a Treaty amendment, as accession treaties require unanimous agreement. However, if the goal is to allow for potentially indefinite delays in free movement, a Treaty amendment might be needed, as this represents a permanent exception to a fundamental Treaty rule.</description></item><item><title>The argument for the UK to remain in the European Arrest Warrant</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-argument-for-the-uk-to-remain-in-the-european-arrest-warrant/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Jul 2022 09:17:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-argument-for-the-uk-to-remain-in-the-european-arrest-warrant/</guid><description>Maria Fletcher, Senior Lecturer in Law at the University of Glasgow, and Steve Peers, Professor of Law at the University of Essex, collaborated on this piece.
