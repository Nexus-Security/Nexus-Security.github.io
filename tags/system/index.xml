Occasionally, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t activate when the stylus made contact, blocking the audio signal from the amplifier. This was a fortunate problem since the relay is the same one used for RPM switching in the 4002 and 4000 models. I had previously designed a breakout board to replace the RPM relay in a Beogram 4000 with a modern, encapsulated SMD signal relay, and I was able to utilize this board in the 4002 repair...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-installation-of-a-new-output-relay-and-a-gnd-switch/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-installation-of-a-new-output-relay-and-a-gnd-switch/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The eco-conscious GROHE smart water system is gaining traction in Asia</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-eco-conscious-grohe-smart-water-system-is-gaining-traction-in-asia/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Mar 2024 06:37:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-eco-conscious-grohe-smart-water-system-is-gaining-traction-in-asia/</guid><description>Source: GROHE. The GROHE Blue system in action.
GROHE Blue, a smart water system, has become increasingly popular in Asia since a May 2014 study revealed its smaller carbon footprint compared to bottled mineral water.
The study estimated that the GROHE Blue system generates 17.96 g CO2-eq/liter, significantly less than the 70 to 600 g CO2-eq/liter produced by bottled mineral water. The variation in bottled water emissions is linked to packaging and origin...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-eco-conscious-grohe-smart-water-system-is-gaining-traction-in-asia/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-eco-conscious-grohe-smart-water-system-is-gaining-traction-in-asia/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Installation of a New Gold Coated DIN5 Plug and a Grounding Switch</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-installation-of-a-new-gold-coated-din5-plug-and-a-grounding-switch/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Mar 2023 09:02:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-installation-of-a-new-gold-coated-din5-plug-and-a-grounding-switch/</guid><description>My restoration of the Beogram 4000 is progressing well. I&amp;rsquo;ve added a grounding switch and a new gold-plated Neutrik DIN5 plug. The switch allows users to choose between the grounding setup of the older 4000/4002 models (separate signal and system grounds) and the later 4004 models (combined grounds). This option helps prevent ground loops and the resulting humming, depending on the amplifier being used.

The resulting measurement curve demonstrates excellent performance, typical of DC motor models. It shows minimal fluctuations (less than 0.05%) over time, aligning with the service manual&amp;rsquo;s specifications. The initial upward slope, lasting a couple of hours, is a common trait in the 551x and 552x models...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-more-rpm-measurements/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-more-rpm-measurements/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): Initial RPM Performance Characterization</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-initial-rpm-performance-characterization/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jan 2023 09:18:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-initial-rpm-performance-characterization/</guid><description>This post follows up on my initial writing about the Beogram 4002 (5513).

The initial performance, measured before the restoration, revealed noticeable, abrupt drops in RPM, indicating typical wear and tear in the DC motor&amp;rsquo;s brass sleeve bearings. These dips, while moderate in this instance, would have been audible due to their 1% magnitude.
After the restoration, which included rebuilding the motor and replacing RPM-related components, the significant RPM fluctuations were eliminated...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5514-rpm-performance-measurement-after-restoration-of-dc-motor-and-control-system/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5514-rpm-performance-measurement-after-restoration-of-dc-motor-and-control-system/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Adjusting the Tracking Force and Replacing the Strange Original Front Center Cabinet Guiding Washer</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-adjusting-the-tracking-force-and-replacing-the-strange-original-front-center-cabinet-guiding-washer/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2022 03:22:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-adjusting-the-tracking-force-and-replacing-the-strange-original-front-center-cabinet-guiding-washer/</guid><description>My Beogram 4000 restoration is complete, and it&amp;rsquo;s playing beautifully.

One of the final tasks was refining the Beogram&amp;rsquo;s mechanics. I calibrated the tonearm weight and limits and replaced the guiding washer, which ensures the plinth moves smoothly.
