Recent developments in EU law show a growing recognition of gender-based asylum claims. A notable example is the June 11, 2024, judgment by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in the case of K, L v Staatssecretaris van Justitie en Veiligheid. This case, concerning two Iraqi sisters seeking asylum in the Netherlands, centers around interpreting &amp;ldquo;membership of a particular social group&amp;rdquo; within the EU&amp;rsquo;s Qualification Directive, specifically regarding &amp;ldquo;westernized women&amp;rdquo; who fear persecution upon returning to their home countries.</description></item><item><title>Three main points about the EU's New Pact on Migration and Asylum</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/three-main-points-about-the-eu-s-new-pact-on-migration-and-asylum/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Nov 2023 03:25:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/three-main-points-about-the-eu-s-new-pact-on-migration-and-asylum/</guid><description>Lilian Tsourdi, Assistant Professor, University of Maastricht

The EU&amp;rsquo;s New Pact on Migration and Asylum, along with its accompanying legislative proposals, represents the latest policy framework for asylum, migration, and border management. Its stated goal is to create streamlined migration procedures and stronger governance. Since September 2020, negotiations on the Pact&amp;rsquo;s legislative components have been underway.
Recently, both the European Parliament (April 2023) and the Council of the European Union (June 2023) have adopted negotiating positions on two significant instruments: the Asylum Procedures Regulation (APR), which updates regulations on determining asylum and related rights, and the Asylum and Migration Management Regulation (AMMR), which reforms the EU&amp;rsquo;s system for allocating responsibility for processing asylum requests and establishing a solidarity framework.</description></item><item><title>Is the ultimate goal of the Provisional Agreement on the recast Reception Conditions Directive to prevent 'Asylum Shopping' and 'Secondary Movements'?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-ultimate-goal-of-the-provisional-agreement-on-the-recast-reception-conditions-directive-to-prevent-asylum-shopping-and-secondary-movements/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Sep 2022 13:28:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-ultimate-goal-of-the-provisional-agreement-on-the-recast-reception-conditions-directive-to-prevent-asylum-shopping-and-secondary-movements/</guid><description>Vasiliki Apatzidou, legal practitioner specializing in EU Asylum Law and PhD Student at Queen Mary University of London.

The Common European Asylum System (CEAS) and its current instruments, including the recast Reception Conditions Directive, have been in effect for almost a decade since 2013. However, the large influx of asylum seekers in 2015 highlighted significant shortcomings, inconsistencies, and gaps in EU asylum legislation. This response to the refugee &amp;lsquo;crisis&amp;rsquo; diminished the relevance of the harmonization goals.</description></item></channel></rss>
