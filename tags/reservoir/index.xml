This involved installing a trimmer to correctly calibrate TR3, the transistor responsible for amplifying the signal from the record detection sensor. The board&amp;rsquo;s condition upon arrival is shown below:
The RPM relay and trimmers had already been replaced by the owner. I finished the restoration by replacing all electrolytic capacitors
and adding a trimmer to enable bias adjustment at the base of TR3.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): Replacing the Electrolytic Capacitors</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-replacing-the-electrolytic-capacitors/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Apr 2024 07:00:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-replacing-the-electrolytic-capacitors/</guid><description>During my Beogram 4002 (5513) restoration project, I focused on replacing components. Using a custom 3D-printed adapter, I substituted the large 4700/1000uF capacitor with modern, compact 105C-rated alternatives. The adapter ensured compatibility with the original mounting hardware.
Following this, I replaced all the tantalum and electrolytic capacitors on the main circuit board, refreshing its components for improved reliability and performance.
The only remaining capacitor, located on the output relay board, will be replaced when I disassemble the keypad to install a professionally refurbished replacement sourced from a Danish Beo expert.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Replacing the Reservoir and Motor Capacitors Using a 3D Printed Adapter</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-replacing-the-reservoir-and-motor-capacitors-using-a-3d-printed-adapter/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2024 07:22:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-replacing-the-reservoir-and-motor-capacitors-using-a-3d-printed-adapter/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m working on restoring a Beogram 4000 turntable, and one of the challenges is finding modern replacements for the large capacitors used in the 1970s. I received a 3D-printed adapter that allows me to neatly install smaller, current-generation capacitors.
These photos show the adapter with the new capacitors in place:
For reliability, I used two 300uF capacitors wired together to replace the original 150uF motor capacitor. The remaining capacitors are high-quality Rubycon, Panasonic, and Multicomp components chosen for their longevity.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): Power Supply and Replacing the Reservoir Capacitors with a 3D Printed Fixture</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-power-supply-and-replacing-the-reservoir-capacitors-with-a-3d-printed-fixture/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Nov 2023 11:59:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-power-supply-and-replacing-the-reservoir-capacitors-with-a-3d-printed-fixture/</guid><description>It seems Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen made two versions of the Beogram 4002 (5513) with different power supply setups, both designed with a possible CD4 upgrade in mind. The output board could be swapped for one with a pre-amplifier and CD4 decoder. One version powers the CD4 board directly from the main PCB&amp;rsquo;s 30V rail and uses a single 4000uF capacitor.
My Beogram 4002 uses a separate power supply for the CD4 board, with its own transformer winding, bridge rectifier, and 1000uF capacitor.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Installation of New Reservoir and Motor Phase Capacitors Using a 3D Printed Adapter</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-installation-of-new-reservoir-and-motor-phase-capacitors-using-a-3d-printed-adapter/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jun 2023 15:57:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-installation-of-new-reservoir-and-motor-phase-capacitors-using-a-3d-printed-adapter/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently restoring a Beogram 4000 and it was time to replace the large capacitors.

Replacing the original reservoir and motor capacitors in AC motor Beograms is always satisfying, and the 4000 boasts an impressive collection of large capacitors.
The initial step involved removing the outdated capacitors. A quick assessment using a BK LCR tester identified two faulty capacitors. One of the 2200uF capacitors registered a meager 7.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Replacing the Reservoir and Motor Electrolytic Capacitors</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-replacing-the-reservoir-and-motor-electrolytic-capacitors/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Feb 2023 11:06:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-replacing-the-reservoir-and-motor-electrolytic-capacitors/</guid><description>Following the gold plating of all switch terminals on a Beogram 4000 restoration project, the next step involved addressing the electronics. The restoration typically begins by replacing outdated reservoir and motor capacitors, as they are frequently out of specification and nearing failure. The image provided showcases these original components.
To ensure proper fitment of the (smaller) modern replacement capacitors, a custom 3D-printed fixture was designed and utilized. This fixture secures the capacitors in the correct position.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Restoration of the AC Motor and Replacement of the Reservoir and Motor Capacitors</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-restoration-of-the-ac-motor-and-replacement-of-the-reservoir-and-motor-capacitors/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jan 2023 01:28:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-restoration-of-the-ac-motor-and-replacement-of-the-reservoir-and-motor-capacitors/</guid><description>Following the restoration of the Beogram 4000&amp;rsquo;s printed circuit boards, attention shifted to the capacitors associated with the reservoir and motor, as well as the AC motor itself. The capacitor and motor section appeared as shown before any servicing.
Visual inspection revealed leakage from the larger capacitors, indicating a critical need for replacement. The extent of the capacitor bay&amp;rsquo;s condition was evident upon their removal.
The AC motor was extracted for servicing, taking advantage of its disconnected state from the capacitors.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Replacing the Light Bulbs in the Control Panel with LEDs</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-replacing-the-light-bulbs-in-the-control-panel-with-leds/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Aug 2022 15:46:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-replacing-the-light-bulbs-in-the-control-panel-with-leds/</guid><description>Following the replacement of the reservoir and motor capacitors in the Beogram 4000, I focused on upgrading the control panel&amp;rsquo;s light bulbs. LEDs offer greater long-term stability and are generally preferable replacements for incandescent bulbs, except in cases where the original circuitry or aesthetics demand otherwise. Given that the control panel&amp;rsquo;s lighting is internal and not directly visible, LEDs are a suitable replacement. In this instance, one of the bulbs illuminating the position scale had failed, causing the entire scale to go dark due to the series arrangement of the two bulbs.</description></item></channel></rss>
