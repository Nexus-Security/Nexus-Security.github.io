The answer depends on the situation.
Regular phones can&amp;rsquo;t plug directly into internet equipment because they use incompatible connectors. To bridge this gap, you need a special phone or an adapter.
Many residential and small business VoIP services, like PhonePower, offer adapters. These adapters allow you to connect your existing phone to your internet modem or router. Inside the adapter, circuitry converts the analog signals of your phone into digital packets for the internet, and vice versa.</description></item><item><title>IP Phones Are In Demand</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ip-phones-are-in-demand/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 May 2023 23:32:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ip-phones-are-in-demand/</guid><description>While business use of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) is booming, residential use is lagging significantly, according to a recent study. This raises the question: are consumers less open to adopting new communication technologies than businesses, or is there another reason for this discrepancy?
IP networks have been steadily replacing traditional phone lines for years, driven by both technological advancements and cost savings. Consumers are primarily drawn to VoIP because it allows them to make calls through their existing broadband internet connection, saving them money compared to traditional phone lines.</description></item><item><title>SOHO VoIP Phone Service With Two Lines at $8.33/mo</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/soho-voip-phone-service-with-two-lines-at-833mo/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Oct 2022 01:16:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/soho-voip-phone-service-with-two-lines-at-833mo/</guid><description>Looking for affordable business or home phone service with great features?

They essentially trick both the phone and the internet connection into thinking they&amp;rsquo;re interacting with familiar systems.
On one side, the ATA connects to a regular phone using a standard RJ-11 jack, providing the necessary power and signals like dial tone and caller ID. It also translates the phone&amp;rsquo;s touch-tone signals into a digital format for VoIP communication using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).</description></item></channel></rss>
