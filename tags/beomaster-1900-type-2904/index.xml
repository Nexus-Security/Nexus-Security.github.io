However, the second unit still requires restoration.
Initial assessment of the second Beomaster 1900 has already been completed, and now it&amp;rsquo;s time to begin replacing capacitors on the main circuit board.
The main circuit board houses most of the capacitors that need replacing. Unfortunately, it cannot be removed for servicing and must remain connected to the wire harness...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-pair-of-beomaster-1900-receivers-for-restoration-capacitor-replacement-on-unit-2/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-pair-of-beomaster-1900-receivers-for-restoration-capacitor-replacement-on-unit-2/</a></p></description></item><item><title>A Pair of Beomaster 1900 Receivers for Restoration: Recapping the Tone Control &amp; FM Tuning Board (Unit #1)</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-pair-of-beomaster-1900-receivers-for-restoration-recapping-the-tone-control-fm-tuning-board-unit-1-/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2024 19:18:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-pair-of-beomaster-1900-receivers-for-restoration-recapping-the-tone-control-fm-tuning-board-unit-1-/</guid><description>The final major task in the Beomaster 1900 restoration, detailed in the previous post, has been completed.
