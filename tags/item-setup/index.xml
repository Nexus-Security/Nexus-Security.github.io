Many Sales Order Processing (SOP) and Purchase Order Processing (POP) problems stem from those initial item setup choices. Users might misunderstand how the system works, not realizing their settings are dictating the behavior â€“ settings that are often easy to change. This happens because setup and transaction entry are often done by different people, or so much time has passed that the reasoning behind setup decisions is forgotten (hence the need for good documentation, though I doubt my coworkers would be thrilled to hear that again).</description></item></channel></rss>
