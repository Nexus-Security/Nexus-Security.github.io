The old plugs often show corrosion due to the lack of gold plating. Upgrading to modern, all-metal plugs with gold-plated terminals is recommended. This upgrade minimizes electromagnetic interference and ensures optimal signal transfer to the amplifier by maintaining low contact resistance, especially important for the delicate MMC20 cartridge signals.
The original RCA plugs on a Beogram 4002 (5513) being restored were in poor condition.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): New Gold Plated RCA Plugs</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-new-gold-plated-rca-plugs/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jun 2024 01:11:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-new-gold-plated-rca-plugs/</guid><description>Over time, many Beogram devices have developed corroded DIN or RCA plugs. It&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to replace these old connectors with new, gold-plated ones. This specific Beogram 4002 (5513) came with RCA connectors.
I typically use large, modern, high-quality metal plugs for replacements. However, this project had a unique requirement: the Beogram needed to connect to a Beolab 5000. The Beolab 5000 has a compact compartment for its connectors, which creates limitations on plug size.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): Replacing the DIN 5 Cable with a Cable Featuring RCA Plugs</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-replacing-the-din-5-cable-with-a-cable-featuring-rca-plugs/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jan 2023 05:50:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-replacing-the-din-5-cable-with-a-cable-featuring-rca-plugs/</guid><description>I am rebuilding a Beogram 4002(5513) turntable to use with a McIntosh Preamplifier. The standard DIN5 connector on Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen equipment is incompatible, so I am replacing it with RCA connectors for the best shielding and lowest EMI. Direct installation inside the turntable offers superior performance compared to adapters.
For optimal sound, I chose high-quality, open-ended RCA cables from Sounds Heavenly in the UK. These cables feature individually shielded, twisted-pair left and right channels, embodying an &amp;ldquo;audiophile&amp;rdquo; design.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5523): Installation of New Gold Plated RCA Plugs</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5523-installation-of-new-gold-plated-rca-plugs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Oct 2022 07:19:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5523-installation-of-new-gold-plated-rca-plugs/</guid><description>The last step in restoring my Beogram 4002 (5523) was replacing the old and slightly corroded RCA plugs. The picture highlights the original plugs:
This image showcases the new gold-plated Amphenol RCA plugs during installation:
The straightforward design of these plugs, which simplifies installation and ensures solid solder connections, is something I appreciate. And here is the finished product:
I need to wait for the PCBs for my new RIAA phono preamp design, so there will be a slight delay.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5523): Replacement of Corroded RCA Plugs</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5523-replacement-of-corroded-rca-plugs/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Sep 2022 04:51:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5523-replacement-of-corroded-rca-plugs/</guid><description>The Beogram 4002 (5523) currently under restoration was equipped with RCA plugs and a grounding wire instead of the typical DIN 5 connector. The plugs and grounding terminal were noticeably dirty and corroded.
The RCA plugs were switched out for all-metal gold-plated ones, and a new grounding terminal was installed.
These compact RCA plugs lack color coding, so 3D-printed inserts were created. These inserts enclose the back of the plugs and provide a visual distinction between the left and right channels.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002: Replacement of Rusty RCA Plugs</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-replacement-of-rusty-rca-plugs/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Jul 2022 14:56:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-replacement-of-rusty-rca-plugs/</guid><description>During my Beogram 4002 (5513) restoration, I swapped out the old, worn-out RCA plugs. The originals were showing their age.
I chose robust, gold-plated Amphenol RCA plugs as replacements. These are excellent for transmitting the low-voltage MMC signal to the amplifier. The metal housing provides superior shielding against electromagnetic interference, ensuring signal integrity. Here&amp;rsquo;s a look after soldering:
And here they are secured:</description></item></channel></rss>
