After rebuilding the boards and motors, I noticed the carriage moved slowly. The 24V rail was only reading 21V, significantly lower than the expected 23.8V.
Then, the arm lowering solenoid began activating erratically when the carriage was touched. It turned out the chassis had a 30V potential relative to the system ground, a dangerous situation.
I found a short circuit between the 24V reservoir capacitor and ground.</description></item></channel></rss>
