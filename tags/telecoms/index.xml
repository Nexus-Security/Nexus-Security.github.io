They claim their service could save businesses up to 95% compared to traditional major telcos.
Currently, Singaporean businesses primarily use traditional PBXs for business-to-business communication. Velox aims to change this with its affordable, cloud-based PBX solution that surpasses the quality of free VoIP services, which often rely on less dependable consumer-grade technology.</description></item></channel></rss>
