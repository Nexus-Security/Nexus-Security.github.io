In the combined cases of ClientEarth v Council (T-682/21 and T-683/21), the General Court of the European Union (GC) reviewed a challenge brought by ClientEarth AISBL and Ms. Leino-Sandberg against the Council of the EU. The applicants sought to overturn the Council&amp;rsquo;s decision to withhold access to documents they had requested under the Public Access to Documents Regulation and the Aarhus Convention Regulation...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/clientearth-v-council-a-significant-win-for-transparency-in-accessing-documents/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/clientearth-v-council-a-significant-win-for-transparency-in-accessing-documents/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Even If There Is No Global Warming</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/even-if-there-is-no-global-warming/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Apr 2024 23:55:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/even-if-there-is-no-global-warming/</guid><description>The debate surrounding climate change is heating up, with strong opinions on both sides. Whether or not human activity is the primary driver of global warming, shifting towards green energy makes sense for a multitude of reasons. We need to change our approach to energy consumption or face serious consequences, potentially even sooner than anticipated.
The current economic downturn has provided a temporary reprieve in energy consumption, but as the economy recovers, the demand for oil will surge...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/even-if-there-is-no-global-warming/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/even-if-there-is-no-global-warming/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Host Gator Serves The Web On Texas Wind Power</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/host-gator-serves-the-web-on-texas-wind-power/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Nov 2023 18:35:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/host-gator-serves-the-web-on-texas-wind-power/</guid><description>Do you want to support eco-friendly businesses but worry about the cost of web hosting?

We already established that alternative energy is a viable option, as solar and wind power are readily available. However, skeptics often question how to ensure a consistent energy supply when natural resources like sunlight and wind are inconsistent.
This is a valid concern since traditional power plants fueled by coal, nuclear, or natural gas have built-in energy storage within their fuel sources and steam boilers...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/every-home-and-business-is-a-battery/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/every-home-and-business-is-a-battery/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The Green Energy Fairy Tale is Real</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-green-energy-fairy-tale-is-real/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jun 2023 05:42:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-green-energy-fairy-tale-is-real/</guid><description>For decades, we&amp;rsquo;ve been promised a utopian future powered by clean energy sources like solar, wind, and fusion.

This &amp;ldquo;vampire power&amp;rdquo; not only increases your electricity bill but also contributes to global warming.
These &amp;ldquo;vampires&amp;rdquo; hide within devices, indicated by glowing lights, active displays, running fans, or warm surfaces, even when the device is switched off. Remote-controlled devices are prime suspects, as they constantly use power to stay ready for remote signals.

To achieve its European Green Deal objectives, the EU aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% of 1990 levels by 2030. As part of this goal, the European Commission introduced the “Fit for 55” legislative package on July 14, 2021. This collection of measures aims to rapidly decarbonize the EU economy by significantly altering the trajectory of emissions and aligning EU policies and legislation across 12 sectors...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/implementing-the-european-green-deal-and-making-the-eu-maritime-transport-sector-fit-for-55-is-pain-necessary-for-gain/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/implementing-the-european-green-deal-and-making-the-eu-maritime-transport-sector-fit-for-55-is-pain-necessary-for-gain/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The Coming Low Power Revolution</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-coming-low-power-revolution/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jun 2022 03:31:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-coming-low-power-revolution/</guid><description>A significant societal shift is underway, centered around a decrease, rather than an increase, in power.
