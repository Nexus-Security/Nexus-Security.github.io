The most critical issue was its malfunctioning solenoid, which appeared unusual and unlike standard B&amp;amp;O components.
Upon disassembling the damper/solenoid assembly, I discovered a makeshift repair job. The original solenoid had been replaced with a different one, and a nail was used as a plunger to activate the solenoid linkage.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Lubricating and Adjusting the Solenoid to Tonearm Linkages</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-lubricating-and-adjusting-the-solenoid-to-tonearm-linkages/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Sep 2023 16:23:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-lubricating-and-adjusting-the-solenoid-to-tonearm-linkages/</guid><description>Following the solenoid replacement and removal of the faulty voltage regulator on my Beogram 4000 restoration project, the arm mechanism remained sluggish. This indicated a need to lubricate the connection between the damper and tonearm lift. Additionally, the tonearm&amp;rsquo;s horizontal alignment was significantly off. While attempting to adjust this with the set screw on the tonearm counterweight&amp;rsquo;s connecting arm, I discovered it was glued in place with epoxy, preventing screwdriver access - likely another consequence of a previous repair attempt.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Cleaning the Switches</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-cleaning-the-switches/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Aug 2023 15:34:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-cleaning-the-switches/</guid><description>A significant issue with the Beogram 4000 design lies in its numerous exposed mechanical switches. Many usability problems stem from oxidized or bent contact tabs on these switches. Attempts to fix these issues often involve bending the contact tabs, which can worsen the problem. This was true for the Beogram I&amp;rsquo;m currently restoring. After replacing the solenoid, the right slide transfer button malfunctioned.
While replacing the control panel&amp;rsquo;s light bulbs with SMD LEDs, I also cleaned the switch contacts.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Exchanging the Electrolytic Capacitors, the RPM Relay, and Adjusting the Motor Signal</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-exchanging-the-electrolytic-capacitors-the-rpm-relay-and-adjusting-the-motor-signal/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jun 2023 20:43:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-exchanging-the-electrolytic-capacitors-the-rpm-relay-and-adjusting-the-motor-signal/</guid><description>My work on the Beogram 4000 turntable restoration continued with replacing all the electrolytic capacitors on the main board and power supply. I used high-quality, long-lasting Japanese components rated at 105C. Knowing that the RPM relays in these models can fail over time, I decided to swap out the old relay with a new one for improved long-term reliability. My objective is to restore these vintage turntables to like-new condition, both aesthetically and functionally.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Installation of New Reservoir and Motor Phase Capacitors Using a 3D Printed Adapter</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-installation-of-new-reservoir-and-motor-phase-capacitors-using-a-3d-printed-adapter/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jun 2023 15:57:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-installation-of-new-reservoir-and-motor-phase-capacitors-using-a-3d-printed-adapter/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently restoring a Beogram 4000 and it was time to replace the large capacitors. This is a process I enjoy, made easier with a 3D printed adapter I designed. This adapter allows for the use of smaller, modern capacitors while maintaining a neat and organized appearance. I have a previous post detailing the connections for anyone who might find it helpful, as there are several jumpers that require re-soldering.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Redesigned Drop-In Tracking Sensor Light Bulb Replacement</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-redesigned-drop-in-tracking-sensor-light-bulb-replacement/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Apr 2023 17:54:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-redesigned-drop-in-tracking-sensor-light-bulb-replacement/</guid><description>During the restoration of a Beogram 4000 turntable, I decided to upgrade the tracking sensor light bulb with a new SMD LED design I had created. My previous design lacked stability with the intensity adjustment trimmer, so I redesigned it to be more secure and visually appealing.
The new design incorporates the trimmer directly onto the circuit board and houses it within the light shield. This required modifications to the 3D printed housing to accommodate the trimmer.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: End Groove Detection Issue</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-end-groove-detection-issue/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Apr 2023 17:24:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-end-groove-detection-issue/</guid><description>Following the hood polishing, I believed my work on this Beogram 4000 was complete, but I was mistaken. A final functionality test before packing revealed a peculiar issue. When the ON button was pressed without a record on the platter, the carriage would move inward as expected, but then halt abruptly before reaching the end switch (ES). Pressing FF would release it, but the carriage would instantly retract without contacting the ES.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Installation of a New Gold Coated DIN5 Plug and a Grounding Switch</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-installation-of-a-new-gold-coated-din5-plug-and-a-grounding-switch/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Mar 2023 09:02:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-installation-of-a-new-gold-coated-din5-plug-and-a-grounding-switch/</guid><description>My restoration of the Beogram 4000 is progressing well. I&amp;rsquo;ve added a grounding switch and a new gold-plated Neutrik DIN5 plug. The switch allows users to choose between the grounding setup of the older 4000/4002 models (separate signal and system grounds) and the later 4004 models (combined grounds). This option helps prevent ground loops and the resulting humming, depending on the amplifier being used. I wrote a detailed post on this topic a while back.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: New Arrival from Italy</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-new-arrival-from-italy/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Mar 2023 20:56:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-new-arrival-from-italy/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled to be working on another Beogram 4000 restoration. The unit arrived from overseas in just three days and was packaged very well, ensuring its safe arrival.
The exterior looks good overall. The wood veneer is undamaged and the dust cover can be polished back to its original shine.
The aluminum trim on the back of the dust cover needs to be reattached, which should be a simple fix. Inside, the aluminum plates need a thorough cleaning.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Polishing the Hood and a Strange Hinge Pin</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-polishing-the-hood-and-a-strange-hinge-pin/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Mar 2023 12:08:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-polishing-the-hood-and-a-strange-hinge-pin/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m completing the restoration of a Beogram 4000 turntable by addressing the final detail: polishing the dust cover. This one, like many I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered, had scratches from improper storage.
This particular unit had a non-original hinge pin, longer than the original, causing it to protrude. I shortened it, restoring a flush fit. The aluminum trim on the other side had also detached, which I reattached using double-sided tape for easy future removal.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Adjusting the Chassis Springs and the Platter Height</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-adjusting-the-chassis-springs-and-the-platter-height/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Dec 2022 03:25:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-adjusting-the-chassis-springs-and-the-platter-height/</guid><description>The Beogram 4000 restoration is progressing into the final cosmetic stage. With the turntable functioning correctly, the focus is now on refining the exterior and replacing minor parts like the plug. Currently, I am fine-tuning the platter height, tilt, and the leaf springs supporting the turntable&amp;rsquo;s floating chassis. This is a delicate process with many interconnected factors. The sensor arm&amp;rsquo;s alignment, platter angle, transport lock travel, and belt tension all need to be perfect for the platter to be level, centered, and parallel to the arms, all while ensuring the chassis clears the open locks.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: A New Pulley, Hood Bumpers and Shipping Back to Italy</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-a-new-pulley-hood-bumpers-and-shipping-back-to-italy/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Nov 2022 14:02:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-a-new-pulley-hood-bumpers-and-shipping-back-to-italy/</guid><description>A Beolover always aims for perfection, and I realized my restoration of the Beogram 4000 wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite finished. Working on a Beogram 8000 reminded me of the importance of rubber hood bumpers for a smooth, quiet closing action. I discovered these bumpers were missing on the Beogram 4000, leaving only remnants of degraded rubber.
To fix this, I carefully removed the old rubber with a small drill bit by hand, avoiding any damage to the plexiglass.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Replacing the Keypad Light Bulbs with LEDs</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-replacing-the-keypad-light-bulbs-with-leds/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Aug 2022 10:16:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-replacing-the-keypad-light-bulbs-with-leds/</guid><description>My Beogram 4000 restoration continued with replacing the control panel&amp;rsquo;s light bulbs with LEDs. This enhances the unit&amp;rsquo;s lifespan and prevents issues that incandescent bulbs, susceptible to vibration, can experience during shipping.
The top two bulbs illuminate the Beogram&amp;rsquo;s unique position indicator, while the vertical bulbs light the RPM trimmers. I recently designed SMD LED-based PCB replacements for the position indicator bulbs (available via email).
Standard red LEDs with current-limiting resistors can replace the RPM trimmer bulbs.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Adjusting the Tracking Force and Replacing the Strange Original Front Center Cabinet Guiding Washer</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-adjusting-the-tracking-force-and-replacing-the-strange-original-front-center-cabinet-guiding-washer/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2022 03:22:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-adjusting-the-tracking-force-and-replacing-the-strange-original-front-center-cabinet-guiding-washer/</guid><description>My Beogram 4000 restoration is complete, and it&amp;rsquo;s playing beautifully. As I write this, I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying &amp;ldquo;Song for My Father&amp;rdquo; by Horace Silver on a reissue, as original pressings are unfortunately outside my budget these days.
One of the final tasks was refining the Beogram&amp;rsquo;s mechanics. I calibrated the tonearm weight and limits and replaced the guiding washer, which ensures the plinth moves smoothly. The original washer, pictured below, has a design flaw that was later corrected in the Beogram 400x series.</description></item></channel></rss>
