They vary in model and price, but they all have one key thing in common: they&amp;rsquo;re free.
You might think these are just outdated phones that no one wants, but that&amp;rsquo;s not the case.

The first DROID, manufactured by Motorola for Verizon Wireless, is a touchscreen QWERTY smartphone utilizing the Android 2.0 operating system. This innovative device was recognized as Time.com&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Top Gadget of 2009&amp;rdquo;.
This top-tier DROID boasts a 5.0-megapixel camera, doubling as a camcorder, with features like geo-tagging, auto-stabilization, flash, and built-in editing tools.</description></item></channel></rss>
