He highlights the Council of Europe&amp;rsquo;s recent Convention aimed at tackling this issue, while also pointing out Malta&amp;rsquo;s legal challenge against it at the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). Malta argues that the treaty clashes with internal market rules, particularly the freedom to provide services, underscoring the difficulties in achieving a unified international response to match-fixing.</description></item></channel></rss>
