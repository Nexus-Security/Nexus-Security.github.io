Case C-347/14 New Media Online GmbH v. Bundeskommunikationssenat, 21 October 2015
Traditionally, broadcasting and newspapers have been regulated differently. Newspapers have enjoyed more lenient, often self-regulatory, oversight. EU law harmonized television broadcasting through the Television without Frontiers Directive. Newspapers, if subject to EU law, fell under general free movement and competition rules. As technology evolved and online information services emerged, the Television without Frontiers Directive underwent revisions, becoming the Audiovisual Media Services Directive.</description></item></channel></rss>
