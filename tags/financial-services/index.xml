When Boris Johnson became British Prime Minister, a no-deal Brexit appeared increasingly possible. UK-based financial services firms were left wondering if and how they would be able to continue serving clients in the remaining 27 EU countries. These firms currently depend on &amp;ldquo;passporting rights,&amp;rdquo; which allow them to operate across borders.

Until recently, the EU courts seemed to consistently rule against the UK in cases related to financial services and opt-outs from EU law. However, a recent General Court judgment regarding the UK&amp;rsquo;s challenge to the European Central Bank (ECB) policy on securities clearing systems has defied these trends. This begs the questions: what does this mean for the UK&amp;rsquo;s financial services sector, and for the UK&amp;rsquo;s relationship with the EU?..<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-uk-has-emerged-victorious-in-a-battle-with-the-financial-services-industry-and-the-european-central-bank-but-the-question-remains-can-it-secure-victory-in-the-overall-war/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-uk-has-emerged-victorious-in-a-battle-with-the-financial-services-industry-and-the-european-central-bank-but-the-question-remains-can-it-secure-victory-in-the-overall-war/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The European Commission's suggestions for environmentally-friendly finance and the efforts of financial regulators to promote sustainability.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-european-commission-s-suggestions-for-environmentally-friendly-finance-and-the-efforts-of-financial-regulators-to-promote-sustainability/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Aug 2023 18:46:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-european-commission-s-suggestions-for-environmentally-friendly-finance-and-the-efforts-of-financial-regulators-to-promote-sustainability/</guid><description>Thomas PiticchioÂ The rising popularity of green politics has led investors to demand more sustainable investment options and increased transparency regarding their money&amp;rsquo;s whereabouts and usage. Consequently, financial intermediaries are introducing &amp;ldquo;green&amp;rdquo; financial products. These products are undergoing regulatory development by the European Commission, aiming to direct capital towards sustainability and clarify what defines a sustainable investment.
