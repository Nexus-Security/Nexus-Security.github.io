Combining consumer-grade options like DSL, cable, or wireless might seem appealing, but achieving a reliable, high-speed connection this way is practically impossible with standard routers.
Instead of another router, consider the Truffles appliance from Mushroom Networks. This innovative device combines multiple internet connections, regardless of type, into a single, high-bandwidth connection.
While traditional &amp;ldquo;T1 bonding&amp;rdquo; offered by carriers has limitations in terms of speed and requiring identical lines from a single provider, Truffles takes a different approach.</description></item><item><title>How Broadband Bonding is Mushrooming</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/how-broadband-bonding-is-mushrooming/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2022 15:52:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/how-broadband-bonding-is-mushrooming/</guid><description>Businesses with high bandwidth demands now have a delicious new option for boosting their WAN capacity thanks to the TRUFFLE from Mushroom Networks, Inc.
What makes the TRUFFLE so appealing? This device can combine the bandwidth of multiple broadband connections – think DSL, Cable, T1, even satellite – to create a single, faster, and more reliable connection, similar to T1 line bonding but with more flexibility. The TRUFFLE BBNA6401 model, for instance, can aggregate up to 6 different connections, reaching download speeds of up to 50 Mbps.</description></item></channel></rss>
