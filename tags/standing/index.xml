In a legal opinion issued on February 20, 2021, Advocate General Hogan addressed a crucial procedural issue: Can a non-EU country legally challenge EU actions before the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU)? This question holds significance because the Court has never directly ruled on it within the context of sanctions, and it delves into the principles governing the relationship between EU law and other international law subjects...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-legal-standing-of-a-third-country-before-the-cjeu-ag-hogan-s-opinion-in-case-c-872-19-p-venezuela-v-council-in-relation-to-state-immunity-and-comity/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-legal-standing-of-a-third-country-before-the-cjeu-ag-hogan-s-opinion-in-case-c-872-19-p-venezuela-v-council-in-relation-to-state-immunity-and-comity/</a></p></description></item><item><title>New discoveries in the "Mellifera" case shed light on access to environmental justice under the Aarhus Regulation, but the underlying issues remain unchanged.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/new-discoveries-in-the-mellifera-case-shed-light-on-access-to-environmental-justice-under-the-aarhus-regulation-but-the-underlying-issues-remain-unchanged/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Feb 2024 01:23:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/new-discoveries-in-the-mellifera-case-shed-light-on-access-to-environmental-justice-under-the-aarhus-regulation-but-the-underlying-issues-remain-unchanged/</guid><description>Mario Pagano, PhD candidate in EU environmental law, European University Institute
Background
The Aarhus Convention is a crucial piece of international law concerning environmental democracy rights. Established in 1998, this UN Convention lays out three procedural rights directly connected to environmental protection: the right to environmental information, the right to participate in environmental decision-making, and the right to legal recourse on environmental issues (the three Aarhus &amp;ldquo;pillars&amp;rdquo;).
The Aarhus Convention Compliance Committee (ACCC), formed in Geneva in 2002, ensures that the legislation of the Convention&amp;rsquo;s Parties aligns with the Convention itself...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/new-discoveries-in-the-mellifera-case-shed-light-on-access-to-environmental-justice-under-the-aarhus-regulation-but-the-underlying-issues-remain-unchanged/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/new-discoveries-in-the-mellifera-case-shed-light-on-access-to-environmental-justice-under-the-aarhus-regulation-but-the-underlying-issues-remain-unchanged/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The Advocate General's Opinion in Grupa Azoty once again exposes a significant deficiency in EU judicial protection, but fails to address the issue.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-advocate-general-s-opinion-in-grupa-azoty-once-again-exposes-a-significant-deficiency-in-eu-judicial-protection-but-fails-to-address-the-issue/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jul 2023 00:52:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-advocate-general-s-opinion-in-grupa-azoty-once-again-exposes-a-significant-deficiency-in-eu-judicial-protection-but-fails-to-address-the-issue/</guid><description>Professor Geert van Calster, University of Leuven

Many citizens across the EU have observed the plight of Greeks limited to €60 withdrawals per day with sympathy and apprehension. This situation stems from the European Central Bank (ECB) restricting emergency funds for Greek banks.
Beyond the human cost, the ECB&amp;rsquo;s actions raise serious legal, political, and economic concerns. A core function of any central bank is acting as a last-resort lender for banks, a role the ECB is demonstrably failing to fulfill in this case...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/challenging-the-legality-of-ecb-restrictions-on-greek-bank-accounts-and-ways-you-can-support-the-cause/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/challenging-the-legality-of-ecb-restrictions-on-greek-bank-accounts-and-ways-you-can-support-the-cause/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
