This was confirmed upon opening the keypad assembly, revealing dull key contacts.
The contact pads were unsoldered and removed for a closer look. While they seemed okay, the leaf contacts engaged by the actuators showed signs of oxidation.
To address the oxidation, a fiberglass brush and Deoxit were used, restoring the contacts to a shiny and clean condition...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-keypad-and-rpm-panel/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-keypad-and-rpm-panel/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 Type 5513: Changing out the tonearm phono cartridge connector</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-changing-out-the-tonearm-phono-cartridge-connector/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jun 2023 11:36:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-changing-out-the-tonearm-phono-cartridge-connector/</guid><description>This Beogram 4002 restoration project was paused until a new batch of Beolover replacement parts for the Beogram 400x tonearm cartridge mounts became available. With the parts in hand, the installation process could begin.
One of the cartridge connector contacts on this particular Beogram 4002 was defective. Whether this was a factory issue or a result of wear and tear is unclear, but the owner&amp;rsquo;s prior problems with cartridge mounting made replacing the connector a necessary step...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-changing-out-the-tonearm-phono-cartridge-connector/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-changing-out-the-tonearm-phono-cartridge-connector/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 Type 5513: Some additions for a previous Beogram project from Houston</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-some-additions-for-a-previous-beogram-project-from-houston/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jun 2023 09:24:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-some-additions-for-a-previous-beogram-project-from-houston/</guid><description>A Beogram 4002 Type 5513 turntable I previously restored in 2018 was returned for a sensor lamp replacement. This turntable had also visited in 2020 for a broken tonearm cartridge mount.
During both prior repairs, the owner opted to retain some original, functioning components, including the sensor lamp, tracking sensor lamp, and output phono muting switch. Since the sensor lamp has now burned out, it will be replaced with a modern Beolover LED assembly...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-some-additions-for-a-previous-beogram-project-from-houston/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-some-additions-for-a-previous-beogram-project-from-houston/</a></p></description></item><item><title> Beogram 4004 Type 5526: Platter Motor, Detector Arm Adjustment and Solenoid Repair</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/-beogram-4004-type-5526-platter-motor-detector-arm-adjustment-and-solenoid-repair/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Apr 2023 09:56:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/-beogram-4004-type-5526-platter-motor-detector-arm-adjustment-and-solenoid-repair/</guid><description>During today&amp;rsquo;s work, I installed the Beogram 4004 platter motor, fine-tuned the position sensor&amp;rsquo;s voltage, calibrated the detector arm sensor, and addressed an issue with the arm lowering solenoid.
My previous checks indicated adjustments would be needed after installing new parts, which is typical.
I also observed that the Beogram 4004&amp;rsquo;s arm solenoid, responsible for lowering the tonearm, was not raising it correctly. There was a lag between the signal to raise the tonearm and the solenoid disengaging...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/-beogram-4004-type-5526-platter-motor-detector-arm-adjustment-and-solenoid-repair/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/-beogram-4004-type-5526-platter-motor-detector-arm-adjustment-and-solenoid-repair/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 Type 5513: RPM Trimmer Panel</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-rpm-trimmer-panel/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jan 2023 19:58:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-rpm-trimmer-panel/</guid><description>In addition to working on the tangential arm assembly, the RPM trimmer panel was also restored. Testing by Beolover has demonstrated that this upgrade reduces the heat affecting the platter motor control circuit and improves the motor&amp;rsquo;s stability.
The original trimmer assembly is shown here with its two original lamps.
The Beolover replacement LED lamp assemblies are designed to be connected to the same solder pads as the original lamps, eliminating the need for board modifications...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-rpm-trimmer-panel/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-rpm-trimmer-panel/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
