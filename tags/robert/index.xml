This demand will likely lead to more attempts to recruit Singaporeans working abroad. Hiring managers believe that these experienced professionals could help alleviate the tight labor market, benefiting both companies and the &amp;ldquo;Fair Consideration Framework,&amp;rdquo; which promotes local hiring.

Many companies are implementing hiring freezes, often mandated by their headquarters, leading managers in Singapore to seek adaptable, temporary staffing solutions.
The survey, which polled over 300 professionals in Singapore with contracting experience, explored the advantages and disadvantages of contract work.</description></item></channel></rss>
