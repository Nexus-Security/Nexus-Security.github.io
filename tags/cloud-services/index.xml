But as companies grow, they usually dedicate staff and resources to handle customer interactions, creating a dedicated department known as a contact center. While contact centers are important, they can be expensive to run. Is there a way to reduce the cost?
Until recently, outsourcing to different locations was an option, but that often led to issues with language barriers and inconsistent service quality.</description></item><item><title>Cheaper Connections To The Cloud</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/cheaper-connections-to-the-cloud/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jun 2024 15:19:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/cheaper-connections-to-the-cloud/</guid><description>Businesses are often quick to celebrate the cost savings of cloud services compared to maintaining their own data centers. However, there&amp;rsquo;s a hidden cost that often catches them off guard: cloud connectivity.
The current cost of bandwidth depends on a company&amp;rsquo;s blend of LAN, MAN, and WAN traffic. Businesses with data centers located in the same building as their employees usually find most of their application traffic stays on the LAN.</description></item><item><title>Hosted VoIP Solutions Include New Phones</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/hosted-voip-solutions-include-new-phones/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 May 2024 09:51:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/hosted-voip-solutions-include-new-phones/</guid><description>Cloud services are changing how we think about technology. Just like server racks are moving to the cloud, so are office phone systems. Traditional PBX systems are being replaced by cloud-hosted solutions. But this transition begs the question: what happens to the physical phone lines?
Similar to connecting data servers off-site, a connection called a SIP Trunk links your on-premise network to the hosted PBX. While it&amp;rsquo;s possible to use existing analog phones with adapters, this approach misses out on the advanced features of Voice over IP (VoIP).</description></item><item><title>Backup Your Gmail and Google Apps While You Can</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/backup-your-gmail-and-google-apps-while-you-can/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Apr 2024 21:31:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/backup-your-gmail-and-google-apps-while-you-can/</guid><description>A lot of us utilize Gmail and other Google services for work due to their ease of use and affordability. However, a major drawback is the lack of robust data recovery options in case of accidental deletions or other mishaps.
Imagine accidentally deleting crucial contact information from your Gmail account. Without a backup, that data would be lost forever.

However, there are two primary types of fiber optic bandwidth: SONET and Gigabit Ethernet.
Developed by telephone companies, SONET (Synchronous Optical NETwork) was initially designed for transmitting numerous simultaneous phone calls between switching centers, both domestically and internationally. SDH (Synchronous Digital Hierarchy) is its international counterpart, often referenced together as SONET/SDH.</description></item><item><title>Stress Testing For Your Website</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/stress-testing-for-your-website/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Nov 2023 19:55:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/stress-testing-for-your-website/</guid><description>You&amp;rsquo;ve successfully launched your website and initiated a marketing campaign.

While many may not be familiar with that era, technology has dramatically changed since then. We&amp;rsquo;ve moved from radio and kilocycles to the digital age with bandwidth measured in Mbps and Gbps. This is the era of big bandwidth.
But what exactly qualifies as &amp;ldquo;big bandwidth&amp;rdquo;? NuVox, a leading telecommunications company, defines it as any bandwidth exceeding 10 Mbps.

IT managers frequently face this dilemma when contemplating between managing an on-site data center and opting for a colocation facility. Now, there&amp;rsquo;s a third option: the cloud.
While both colocation and cloud services are obtained from external providers, the differences between them are significant from an operational standpoint.
Colocation facilities shine by offering a physical space designed for IT needs.</description></item><item><title>Big Data Needs Big Bandwidth</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/big-data-needs-big-bandwidth/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Sep 2023 22:07:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/big-data-needs-big-bandwidth/</guid><description>By: John Shepler
Bandwidth is expanding at an incredible rate. Currently, a major infrastructural development is the shift towards 100 Gbps (100 GigE) wavelength services for national and international connections. It seems like only yesterday Gigabit Ethernet was a new concept, impractical for most businesses. These days, GigE is a basic requirement in some fields. What&amp;rsquo;s driving this huge need for more bandwidth?

Human communication might not dominate telecom usage for much longer. It started when computers began sharing data over phone lines and sped up when broadband internet connected almost every computer. Even though people currently use the internet for websites, messaging, social media, videos, backups, and work, machines will soon be the primary users, communicating amongst themselves.
The Rise of Artificial Intelligence

Hosted voice service challenges this notion, requiring only the phones themselves and sometimes providing even those.
Hosted Voice, also called Hosted VoIP or Hosted PBX, is a cloud-based service. The PBX system still exists but resides at the service provider&amp;rsquo;s location, not yours.
This model resembles what companies used decades ago when telephone service was provided by a single entity like Bell System.</description></item><item><title>The Rush To Cloud Service Data Centers</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-rush-to-cloud-service-data-centers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Dec 2022 12:17:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-rush-to-cloud-service-data-centers/</guid><description>Many companies are moving away from managing their own servers and rapidly shifting towards public data centers. This article explores the reasons behind this trend and its potential future.
Cost savings have always been a major driver for companies considering data center colocation.

Software Defined Networks (SDN) and Software Defined Wide Area Networks (SD-WAN) are seeing increased implementation due to their ability to offer cost-effective, high-quality bandwidth for businesses. SD-WAN is sometimes the sole option for acceptable bandwidth in remote or rural locations. These software-defined networks act as a blend of various connection technologies, intelligently maximizing the use of each available connection, including satellite.
The Need For SD Networks

One of the biggest advantages of cloud services over traditional IT infrastructure is their flexibility. With a vast pool of virtual servers and storage, businesses can adjust resources on demand, significantly improving productivity and resource usage.
However, connectivity hasn&amp;rsquo;t quite caught up with this shift. Connecting to the cloud often relies on fixed-capacity connections.

Despite the rise of computers, high-speed printers led to increased printing, resulting in a cycle of paper consumption and shredding.
Cloud services offer a potential solution by enabling work processes that don&amp;rsquo;t rely on physical documents. While some businesses transition to online operations, others remain partially offline, necessitating physical documents for legal and operational purposes.
This reliance on paper persists due to the need for legally valid signatures on agreements, forms, and contracts, as digital communication methods are often insufficient.</description></item><item><title>Finding Lit Buildings and Near Net Fiber Buildings</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/finding-lit-buildings-and-near-net-fiber-buildings/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Oct 2022 03:02:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/finding-lit-buildings-and-near-net-fiber-buildings/</guid><description>By: John Shepler
Fiber optic internet service is becoming increasingly essential for modern businesses, but not everyone has access to it.
