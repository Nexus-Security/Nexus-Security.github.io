Chip-On-A-Shingle, a clod computing startup, defines a &amp;ldquo;clod&amp;rdquo; as a network of interconnected old computers and devices that collectively provide impressive processing power.

This unexpected move aims to dedicate this valuable spectrum solely to Twitter.
FCC Chairman Lowon B. Andwidth explained that a recent study revealed Twitter&amp;rsquo;s explosive growth will soon consume all available bandwidth.
