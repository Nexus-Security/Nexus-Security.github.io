Businesses are producing and sharing more video content, medical imaging has transitioned to digital platforms, and cloud-based IT relies heavily on bandwidth. However, finding available fiber services and their costs can be a tedious and time-consuming process.
Imagine getting instant online quotes for fiber optic services. It might seem too good to be true, but it&amp;rsquo;s now a reality. The Telarus GeoQuote bandwidth search engine has been enhanced to provide instant online quotes for Ethernet over Fiber, with bandwidth options ranging from 10 Mbps to 1 Gbps (GigE).</description></item><item><title>Double Bonded T1 Cost and Alternatives</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/double-bonded-t1-cost-and-alternatives/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jul 2022 23:16:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/double-bonded-t1-cost-and-alternatives/</guid><description>Many businesses appreciate their reliable T1 service, but eventually, the 1.5 Mbps bandwidth becomes insufficient. Instead of abandoning T1, companies can opt for double bonded T1 service, which combines two lines to provide 3 Mbps. This bonding is implemented within customer premises equipment, usually a router with two T1 inputs.
The bandwidth can be further increased by triple bonding (4.5 Mbps) or quadruple bonding (6 Mbps), up to a practical limit of eight bonded lines for 12 Mbps.</description></item></channel></rss>
