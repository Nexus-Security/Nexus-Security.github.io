This would establish a new record for global announced deals in the first six months of a year.
The Asia Pacific (APAC) region leads in early-stage M&amp;amp;A activity, demonstrating 44% year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter of 2016, and is positioned to significantly contribute to the projected record deal count in the first half of 2017.</description></item></channel></rss>
