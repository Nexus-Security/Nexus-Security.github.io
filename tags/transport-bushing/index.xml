This post details the remounting of the floating chassis within the cabinet, replacing the reservoir capacitor, and installing the refurbished platter motor.
Here are the parts needed for mounting the floating suspension system back into the cabinet.
The threaded pin&amp;rsquo;s longer section is positioned at the bottom. When attaching the wing-nut, ensure it sits at the very beginning of the thread. I personally position it to allow enough thread for securing the nut while keeping the nut&amp;rsquo;s outer edge aligned with the topmost thread.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 Type 5513: Progress Update</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-progress-update/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Aug 2023 08:28:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-progress-update/</guid><description>The next stage of the restoration involved removing parts from the Beogram chassis. This was necessary to access the tangential arm for repairs and to thoroughly clean the disintegrated transport bushings.
Fragments of the old bushings were scattered throughout the chassis, even within the tonearm cover.
This image shows the Beogram chassis after a thorough cleaning.
Next, 3D-printed replacement bushings from Beolover were installed.
The new bushings fit perfectly. When reattaching the floating chassis, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to align the top and bottom locking washers on their respective threads.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002: New Project From Houston</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-new-project-from-houston/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Mar 2023 16:16:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-new-project-from-houston/</guid><description>My next project takes me away from Beomaster restorations and back to Beogram turntables. It&amp;rsquo;s great to work on both, so I&amp;rsquo;m excited regardless. A gentleman from Houston entrusted me with two Beogram 4002 Type 5513 turntables he acquired some years ago. As time took its toll, they stopped functioning properly.Â Like many Beogram 4002 owners, he realized he missed listening to his vinyl records and decided to have them restored.</description></item></channel></rss>
