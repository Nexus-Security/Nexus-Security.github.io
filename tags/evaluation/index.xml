The control panel buttons show typical wear from use, but the dust cover is in good condition with only minor marks. The tonearm requires adjustment as it sits too low when the turntable is not in use.
The turntable&amp;rsquo;s interior is very clean, suggesting it was kept in a good environment.
The original washers for the floating suspension lock-down are intact.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002: New Project From Houston</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-new-project-from-houston/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Mar 2023 16:16:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-new-project-from-houston/</guid><description>My next project takes me away from Beomaster restorations and back to Beogram turntables. It&amp;rsquo;s great to work on both, so I&amp;rsquo;m excited regardless. A gentleman from Houston entrusted me with two Beogram 4002 Type 5513 turntables he acquired some years ago. As time took its toll, they stopped functioning properly.Â Like many Beogram 4002 owners, he realized he missed listening to his vinyl records and decided to have them restored.</description></item></channel></rss>
