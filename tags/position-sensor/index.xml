Now, I&amp;rsquo;m focusing on the Beogram 4002&amp;rsquo;s cabinet and its mechanical parts.
I prefer working on the floating chassis with it removed, which is easier since I&amp;rsquo;ll disassemble most of the tangential arm.
This revealed some hidden issues.
Initially, I believed the three chassis lock bushings were okay because they looked fine. However, examining the locking mechanism showed otherwise.
This was the first indication of the bushings&amp;rsquo; poor condition.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 Type 5513: Going Through the Service Manual Checks and Adjustments</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-going-through-the-service-manual-checks-and-adjustments/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jun 2022 11:36:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-going-through-the-service-manual-checks-and-adjustments/</guid><description>This past weekend, I began working on some of the checks and adjustments outlined in the Beogram 4002 service manual. The manual details both electrical and mechanical procedures.
On the electrical side, my primary focus is to ensure that the photo sensors generate strong signals when activated by their light sources. Maintaining correct voltages is crucial for the proper function of the Beogram 4002&amp;rsquo;s analog control system.
Mechanically, I&amp;rsquo;ll be aligning both the Beogram&amp;rsquo;s fixed arm and tonearm.</description></item></channel></rss>
