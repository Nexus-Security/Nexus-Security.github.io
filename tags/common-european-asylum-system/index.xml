The Pact, as it stands, fails to directly address the rights of stateless individuals or offer solutions to the specific protection issues they encounter.</description></item><item><title>European academics are appealing for the EU to avoid becoming a lawless zone.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/european-academics-are-appealing-for-the-eu-to-avoid-becoming-a-lawless-zone/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jul 2024 22:29:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/european-academics-are-appealing-for-the-eu-to-avoid-becoming-a-lawless-zone/</guid><description>The situation at the Polish-Belarusian border briefly gained public awareness, with images of suffering refugees stranded in terrible conditions sparking outrage.

A central question in international refugee law is whether women can qualify for refugee status based solely on their gender.

Unaccompanied minors can appeal a receiving EU member state&amp;rsquo;s denial of a request to assume responsibility for their asylum case. This conclusion from the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) comes from its judgment in the I. &amp;amp; S. case.

Recent developments in EU law show a growing recognition of gender-based asylum claims. A notable example is the June 11, 2024, judgment by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in the case of K, L v Staatssecretaris van Justitie en Veiligheid. This case, concerning two Iraqi sisters seeking asylum in the Netherlands, centers around interpreting &amp;ldquo;membership of a particular social group&amp;rdquo; within the EU&amp;rsquo;s Qualification Directive, specifically regarding &amp;ldquo;westernized women&amp;rdquo; who fear persecution upon returning to their home countries.</description></item><item><title>The European Court of Justice's initial decision on detaining asylum-seekers within the Dublin system and its implications for the rule of law in immigration detention.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-european-court-of-justice-s-initial-decision-on-detaining-asylum-seekers-within-the-dublin-system-and-its-implications-for-the-rule-of-law-in-immigration-detention/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Mar 2024 02:24:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-european-court-of-justice-s-initial-decision-on-detaining-asylum-seekers-within-the-dublin-system-and-its-implications-for-the-rule-of-law-in-immigration-detention/</guid><description>Tommaso Poli, LL.M. candidate in Human Rights and Humanitarian Law at the University of Essex, School of Law.
The detention of those seeking asylum is a contentious issue within immigration law. While not initially covered by the European Common Asylum System (CEAS), it is now addressed in several of the second-phase CEAS measures. These measures include the Asylum Procedures Directive, the Reception Conditions Directive, the Qualification Directive, the Dublin Regulation, and the EURODAC Regulation.</description></item><item><title>The Dublin system: Balancing Mutual Trust and Human Rights Protection in the ECJ</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-dublin-system-balancing-mutual-trust-and-human-rights-protection-in-the-ecj/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jan 2024 20:51:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-dublin-system-balancing-mutual-trust-and-human-rights-protection-in-the-ecj/</guid><description>By Cecilia Rizcallah, Research Fellow at the Belgian National Fund for Scientific Research affiliated to the Centre of Interdisciplinary Research in Constitutional Law of Saint-Louis University (USL-B) and the Centre of European Law of the Free University Brussels (ULB).

Shortly before Christmas 2023, the European Parliament and the Council finalized an agreement on five crucial components of EU asylum law. These components address asylum procedures, the &amp;lsquo;Dublin&amp;rsquo; system for determining responsibility for asylum applications, the supporting &amp;lsquo;Eurodac&amp;rsquo; database, migrant/asylum seeker screening, and crisis derogations.</description></item><item><title>Three main points about the EU's New Pact on Migration and Asylum</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/three-main-points-about-the-eu-s-new-pact-on-migration-and-asylum/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Nov 2023 03:25:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/three-main-points-about-the-eu-s-new-pact-on-migration-and-asylum/</guid><description>Lilian Tsourdi, Assistant Professor, University of Maastricht

The EU&amp;rsquo;s New Pact on Migration and Asylum, along with its accompanying legislative proposals, represents the latest policy framework for asylum, migration, and border management. Its stated goal is to create streamlined migration procedures and stronger governance. Since September 2020, negotiations on the Pact&amp;rsquo;s legislative components have been underway.
Recently, both the European Parliament (April 2023) and the Council of the European Union (June 2023) have adopted negotiating positions on two significant instruments: the Asylum Procedures Regulation (APR), which updates regulations on determining asylum and related rights, and the Asylum and Migration Management Regulation (AMMR), which reforms the EU&amp;rsquo;s system for allocating responsibility for processing asylum requests and establishing a solidarity framework.</description></item><item><title>EU Law and Policy on the Relocation of Asylum-Seekers</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/eu-law-and-policy-on-the-relocation-of-asylum-seekers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 18:50:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/eu-law-and-policy-on-the-relocation-of-asylum-seekers/</guid><description>Steve Peers recently discussed the legal aspects of the refugee crisis, focusing on international law.

Reaching the age of 18 is a major milestone, signifying a transition to adulthood. While it may not bring immediate changes to family dynamics, it holds significant legal implications.
However, in immigration and asylum law, turning 18 can mean reduced legal rights, especially for vulnerable unaccompanied minors. Given lengthy legal processes, a key question arises: When an applicant starts as a minor but turns 18 before the process concludes, do they keep the protections afforded to children?</description></item><item><title>The CJEU upholds the right of asylum seekers to family housing.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-upholds-the-right-of-asylum-seekers-to-family-housing/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Sep 2023 18:41:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-upholds-the-right-of-asylum-seekers-to-family-housing/</guid><description>Professor Steve Peers, University of Essex

The EU faces another crisis alongside &amp;ldquo;Grexit&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Brexit&amp;rdquo;: a surge in immigration. Initial EU responses culminated in an emergency summit in April.

The significant loss of life near Lampedusa last autumn, when numerous migrants drowned attempting to cross the Mediterranean, represents one of the most recent and tragic outcomes of irregular migration across this sea. This event should have prompted a thorough reevaluation of EU policies concerning border control and visas but did not.

As the EU proposes yet another collaboration with a non-EU nation to manage migration beyond its borders, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to critically examine the EU&amp;rsquo;s externalization policy and its use of informal cooperation. This analysis should consider the historical, legal, and political context of the EU&amp;rsquo;s external migration and asylum policy.

The Common European Asylum System (CEAS) and its current instruments, including the recast Reception Conditions Directive, have been in effect for almost a decade since 2013. However, the large influx of asylum seekers in 2015 highlighted significant shortcomings, inconsistencies, and gaps in EU asylum legislation. This response to the refugee &amp;lsquo;crisis&amp;rsquo; diminished the relevance of the harmonization goals.</description></item><item><title>Strengthening and weakening the legal standing of individuals granted subsidiary protection under European Union law – the ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union in the case of Alo and Osso.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/strengthening-and-weakening-the-legal-standing-of-individuals-granted-subsidiary-protection-under-european-union-law-the-ruling-by-the-court-of-justice-of-the-european-union-in-the-case-of-alo-and-osso/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Aug 2022 23:33:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/strengthening-and-weakening-the-legal-standing-of-individuals-granted-subsidiary-protection-under-european-union-law-the-ruling-by-the-court-of-justice-of-the-european-union-in-the-case-of-alo-and-osso/</guid><description>Dr. Louise Halleskov Storgaard, Assistant Professor, Aarhus University
Can a country that offers subsidiary protection (a form of protection similar to refugee status) restrict the movement of those beneficiaries within its borders if they receive social security benefits? This is the central question addressed by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in the Alo and Osso case on March 1, 2015. The CJEU’s answer is notable, innovative, and potentially contentious as it reinforces the influence of the Geneva Convention on subsidiary protection standards but also raises questions about the applicable non-discrimination standard.</description></item><item><title>Mr. Avramopolous travels to Brussels: reflections on the European Parliament hearing for the new Migration Commissioner</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/mr-avramopolous-travels-to-brussels-reflections-on-the-european-parliament-hearing-for-the-new-migration-commissioner/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Aug 2022 04:24:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/mr-avramopolous-travels-to-brussels-reflections-on-the-european-parliament-hearing-for-the-new-migration-commissioner/</guid><description>Steve Peers
Throughout his extensive three-hour hearing at the European Parliament, Dimitris Avramopolous, the nominee for Commissioner for migration and home affairs, consistently emphasized his commitment to liberal values. He expressed strong support for upholding the Schengen system, adopting a liberal stance on asylum and legal migration, and protecting the freedom of movement for EU citizens. However, he fell short of providing specifics on the implementation of these principles and how the various facets of EU policy in this domain would harmonize.</description></item><item><title>Evaluating the new proposal on "Safe countries of origin</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/evaluating-the-new-proposal-on-safe-countries-of-origin/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Jul 2022 11:28:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/evaluating-the-new-proposal-on-safe-countries-of-origin/</guid><description>Steve Peers
The EU Commission recently introduced several new immigration and asylum initiatives. Three proposals, in particular, suggest binding measures: a temporary relocation measure for asylum-seekers, a permanent relocation system for asylum-seekers, and a regulation establishing a common list of &amp;ldquo;safe countries of origin.&amp;rdquo; This list would include Western Balkan countries and Turkey. This article will focus on the &amp;ldquo;safe country of origin&amp;rdquo; rules.
It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that the UK, Ireland, and Denmark are not subject to these measures.</description></item><item><title>Is the Dublin Regulation coming to an end?

Recent events have sparked debate concerning the EU&amp;rsquo;s Dublin III Regulation, which dictates where asylum seekers must apply for asylum within the EU. A British court ruled that the UK is responsible for the asylum claims of unaccompanied children in France, particularly those in Calais, if they have family in the UK. Additionally, a press release suggested the Commission may soon propose significant changes to the Dublin rules.</description></item><item><title>Resistance is useless: examining the new Eurodac Regulation – part 4 of the analysis of recent EU asylum legislation.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/resistance-is-useless-examining-the-new-eurodac-regulation-part-4-of-the-analysis-of-recent-eu-asylum-legislation/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2022 18:10:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/resistance-is-useless-examining-the-new-eurodac-regulation-part-4-of-the-analysis-of-recent-eu-asylum-legislation/</guid><description>Professor Steve Peers, Royal Holloway University of London

Shortly before Christmas, the European Parliament and the Council, the EU body representing ministers from Member States, agreed on five crucial aspects of EU asylum law. These aspects include asylum procedures, the ‘Dublin’ system for determining responsibility for asylum claims, the ‘Eurodac’ database that supports the Dublin system, the screening process for migrants and asylum seekers, and derogations during crises.</description></item></channel></rss>
