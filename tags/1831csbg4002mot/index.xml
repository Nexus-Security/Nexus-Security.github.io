The motor required repair. The owner had already performed the &amp;lsquo;oil infusion&amp;rsquo; procedure for the Oilite bearings. However, after reassembling and reinstalling the motor into the Beogram, the platter&amp;rsquo;s speed was excessively high and could not be adjusted.

Uncontrollably high speed in a DC platter motor usually indicates a problem with one or both of the RPM feedback pickup coils within the motor, assuming the motor control circuit is functioning correctly.</description></item></channel></rss>
