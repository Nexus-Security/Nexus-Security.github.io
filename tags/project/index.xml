TeamAhoy (previously known as Birds Eye View), an Australian company, has introduced the first public version of its project management software. The startup highlights that its software differentiates itself by prioritizing the human element, unlike competitors.
Founder Damian Bramanis explains that while teams consist of people, most project management tools don&amp;rsquo;t reflect this in their design. He believes TeamAhoy stands out by offering managers a user-friendly platform that centers around individuals.</description></item></channel></rss>
