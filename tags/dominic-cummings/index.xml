Dominic Cummings recently criticized me and others on Twitter, calling us &amp;ldquo;charlatan campaigning lawyers&amp;rdquo; who are &amp;ldquo;really bad at politics.&amp;rdquo; He based this on a tweet by David Allen Green about the potential reversal of Brexit and a baseless claim that we believed Dominic Grieve could defeat the Vote Leave campaign in 2019.
Cummings&amp;rsquo; critique of my political skills is irrelevant, as I am a law professor, not a politician or political strategist.</description></item></channel></rss>
