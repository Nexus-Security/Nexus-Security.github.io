Economic growth sped up towards the end of 2016, hitting 3.8% with 0.5% deflation, partly due to a currency appreciation of about 9%. The 2016 deficit was kept to 4.5% of GDP due to controlled spending on less critical items and the rescheduling of some investment projects, even though tax revenue fell short of expectations. Efforts to consolidate the budget should continue to achieve the 2017 fiscal deficit target of 3% of GDP.</description></item></channel></rss>
