This stopped attackers from directly reaching the castle. Similarly, today&amp;rsquo;s networks need more than just firewalls.
Firewalls are effective but can be overwhelmed. Cloud-based security acts as a modern moat, providing a barrier outside the network. MegaPath&amp;rsquo;s Unified Threat Management (UTM) uses this approach, offering cloud, on-site, or hybrid security solutions.
MegaPath&amp;rsquo;s UTM is a multi-layered Security as a Service (SaaS) solution that handles simple and complex threats, while also managing security alerts, logs, and compliance.</description></item><item><title>Point to Point Fiber Optic Connections</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/point-to-point-fiber-optic-connections/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Apr 2023 02:09:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/point-to-point-fiber-optic-connections/</guid><description>By: John Shepler
Let&amp;rsquo;s say you need a secure connection with decent bandwidth between two business sites. Should you use the internet, or is there a better option?
The Benefits of Private Lines
The internet has two main advantages: global reach and affordability. However, it also has two significant drawbacks: inconsistent performance and security vulnerabilities.
A superior alternative is private lines, specifically dedicated point-to-point connections. These are genuinely private.
Security is greatly enhanced because accessing a network you&amp;rsquo;re not connected to is incredibly difficult.</description></item></channel></rss>
