Testing the resistance of both LDRs with +15 VDC on the light source, I noticed a significant difference between them, leading me to believe one was faulty. However, upon removing and re-testing them, the resistance values were much closer.
It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that my testing method involved a simple setup with an LED work light as a light source.</description></item></channel></rss>
