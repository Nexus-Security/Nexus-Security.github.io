The draft agreement regarding the UK&amp;rsquo;s EU membership has sparked significant debate. While some, mostly within the UK, believe it doesn&amp;rsquo;t go far enough, others, primarily from the remaining EU member states, argue it grants excessive revisions to EU law for a single member state. These are primarily substantive concerns. While I have previously addressed some immigration-related issues within the draft, I will delve into other substantive matters later...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-draft-uk-eu-renegotiation-deal-considered-to-be-legally-binding-and-irreversible/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-draft-uk-eu-renegotiation-deal-considered-to-be-legally-binding-and-irreversible/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The relationship between the EU and Morocco and the issue of the Western Sahara: the European Court of Justice and the principles of international law</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-relationship-between-the-eu-and-morocco-and-the-issue-of-the-western-sahara-the-european-court-of-justice-and-the-principles-of-international-law/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Feb 2023 04:16:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-relationship-between-the-eu-and-morocco-and-the-issue-of-the-western-sahara-the-european-court-of-justice-and-the-principles-of-international-law/</guid><description>Markus W.

On December 21, 2016, the Court of Justice issued its appeals decision in the case of Council v. Front Polisario. This Grand Chamber judgment, reached under an expedited procedure, overturned the prior decision made by the EU General Court in Front Polisario v Council roughly a year before...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-relationship-between-the-eu-and-morocco-and-the-issue-of-the-western-sahara-the-european-court-of-justice-and-the-principles-of-international-law/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-relationship-between-the-eu-and-morocco-and-the-issue-of-the-western-sahara-the-european-court-of-justice-and-the-principles-of-international-law/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The legal status and impact of the UK/EU renegotiation deal.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-legal-status-and-impact-of-the-uk-eu-renegotiation-deal/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jan 2023 14:27:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-legal-status-and-impact-of-the-uk-eu-renegotiation-deal/</guid><description>Is the UK&amp;rsquo;s renegotiated EU membership deal legally binding? Steve Peers explores whether the UK&amp;rsquo;s renegotiated EU membership deal is legally binding and what implications this has. He examines various aspects of the deal, including its legal status, enforceability, and potential for reversibility.
Legal Complexity and Forms The renegotiation deal is comprised of seven legal documents: a Decision by EU Heads of State and Government, a Statement by the same group (including a draft Council Decision), a European Council Declaration, and four Commission declarations...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-legal-status-and-impact-of-the-uk-eu-renegotiation-deal/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-legal-status-and-impact-of-the-uk-eu-renegotiation-deal/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The politicization of treaty obligations in private schools.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-politicization-of-treaty-obligations-in-private-schools/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jun 2022 08:30:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-politicization-of-treaty-obligations-in-private-schools/</guid><description>Dr Kasey McCall-Smith, SeniorÂ Lecturer in Public International Law, University of Edinburgh
The Labour Party&amp;rsquo;s 2019 Annual Conference has drawn significant attention, particularly for its resolution to eliminate private schools in the UK. This highlights the need to examine politicians&amp;rsquo; passionate pronouncements in light of legal realities, especially international and human rights law. Similar situations arose earlier this year when Theresa May presented a unilateral statement on the UK&amp;rsquo;s interpretation of the Withdrawal Agreement Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland and when Geoffrey Cox MP incorrectly suggested that the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) offered a simple solution to the Brexit withdrawal agreement and the backstop...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-politicization-of-treaty-obligations-in-private-schools/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-politicization-of-treaty-obligations-in-private-schools/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
