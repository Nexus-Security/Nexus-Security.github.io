In today&amp;rsquo;s interconnected world, businesses depend heavily on infrastructure like electricity, telephone lines, and internet connectivity, often delivered through copper cables. While electricity and landline phones are widely accessible due to national initiatives, internet availability, particularly broadband via copper or fiber optic cables, diminishes as you move away from city centers. Rural areas often lack wired internet infrastructure entirely, leaving businesses with limited choices.
One option for these areas is wireless internet...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/wireless-business-internet-options/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/wireless-business-internet-options/</a></p></description></item><item><title>How to Feed a Hungry WISP</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/how-to-feed-a-hungry-wisp/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jan 2024 21:51:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/how-to-feed-a-hungry-wisp/</guid><description>By: John Shepler
The United States is extensively wired, except in remote areas like farms, rural homes, businesses outside city limits, new developments, and some industrial parks. While universal service often provides phone access, broadband internet is less certain. This is where Wireless Internet Service Providers (WISPs) come in.
Why WISPs?
WISPs function like cell phone providers but focus on high-speed internet. Unlike 4G cellular data, which has low usage limits, WISPs offer generous data allowances similar to cable, telco, or fiber optic services...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/how-to-feed-a-hungry-wisp/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/how-to-feed-a-hungry-wisp/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Ethernet over Fixed Wireless Broadband</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-over-fixed-wireless-broadband/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jul 2023 01:04:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-over-fixed-wireless-broadband/</guid><description>Businesses are discovering the advantages of Metro Ethernet over traditional copper and fiber optic cables. However, there&amp;rsquo;s a lesser-known alternative: Ethernet over Fixed Wireless, offering a fast and budget-friendly way to get the bandwidth you need.
Ethernet over Fixed Wireless (EoFW) is distinct from familiar portable or mobile wireless services like WiFi, WiMAX, or LTE. While these offer broadband within a defined area for general, unencrypted use, their bandwidth is limited and shared, resulting in unpredictable connection speeds...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-over-fixed-wireless-broadband/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-over-fixed-wireless-broadband/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Fixed Wireless As Fiber Backup</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/fixed-wireless-as-fiber-backup/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jan 2023 06:29:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/fixed-wireless-as-fiber-backup/</guid><description>By: John Shepler
To power your business systems, such as phone systems, conferencing tools, and cloud-based software, you need a lot of reliable bandwidth. Usually, fiber optic connectivity is the answer. But what if the fiber line is cut (it happens), can&amp;rsquo;t be installed quickly enough, or is too expensive to install? In these situations, if you&amp;rsquo;re in the right area, fixed wireless might be the best solution.
What is Fixed Wireless?..<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/fixed-wireless-as-fiber-backup/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/fixed-wireless-as-fiber-backup/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
