This agreement is intended to safeguard investors from both Singapore and Kazakhstan, giving them more confidence to pursue investment opportunities in each other&amp;rsquo;s countries. The treaty ensures that Singaporean companies operating in Kazakhstan will have additional protection for their investments beyond what is provided by Kazakhstan&amp;rsquo;s domestic laws, and the same applies to Kazakh companies in Singapore.</description></item></channel></rss>
