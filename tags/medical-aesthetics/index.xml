Over 23 million cosmetic procedures, both surgical and non-surgical, were performed globally in 2013, as reported by the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ISAPS). This international society comprises over 2,700 board-certified aesthetic plastic surgeons across 95 countries.
Botulinum toxin (Botox) injections were the most common cosmetic procedure performed.
Dr. Carlos Uebel, ISAPS President, highlighted the improved data collection strategy for the report, stating that the society aimed to enhance the comprehensiveness and statistical soundness of the survey methodology.</description></item></channel></rss>
