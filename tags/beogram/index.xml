The tray features three rectangular cutouts to provide clearance for the solder points.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Restoring the Carriage Position and Solenoid Driven Switches</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-restoring-the-carriage-position-and-solenoid-driven-switches/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Dec 2023 22:33:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-restoring-the-carriage-position-and-solenoid-driven-switches/</guid><description>Following the keypad cluster rebuild on this Beogram 4000 turntable, the next step was to address the mechanical switches that control its operation. These switches are grouped into two clusters: one set located under the carriage that dictates tonearm positioning, and another positioned near the solenoid. The solenoid-activated switches are critical for engaging the tracking mechanism, initiating output when the stylus is in the groove, and regulating the solenoid power upon the arm&amp;rsquo;s descent.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Choppily Rotating AC Platter Motor - Repair of Wien-Bridge Oscillator Circuit</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-choppily-rotating-ac-platter-motor-repair-of-wien-bridge-oscillator-circuit/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Nov 2023 12:58:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-choppily-rotating-ac-platter-motor-repair-of-wien-bridge-oscillator-circuit/</guid><description>This Beogram 4000 restoration project presented a recurring issue: a malfunctioning oscillator circuit responsible for powering the AC platter motor. This was unusual, as previous 4002 and 4000 models hadn&amp;rsquo;t shown this problem. Although the light bulbs managing the circuit&amp;rsquo;s Automatic Gain Control (AGC) weren&amp;rsquo;t visually illuminated during motor operation, suggesting a longer lifespan compared to indicator bulbs, this unit proved otherwise. It&amp;rsquo;s likely that factors like mechanical vibrations, particularly during transport, could have damaged the bulbs.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): Replacement of Sensor Arm Bulb with an LED Assembly</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-replacement-of-sensor-arm-bulb-with-an-led-assembly/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Nov 2023 11:08:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-replacement-of-sensor-arm-bulb-with-an-led-assembly/</guid><description>During the restoration of a Beogram 4002 turntable, the light bulb in the sensor arm, crucial for record detection, was replaced with a longer-lasting LED.
To ensure compatibility with the turntable&amp;rsquo;s bulb detection circuit, which disables record detection if a bulb failure is detected, the LED assembly was designed to mimic the current draw of the original bulb. LEDs inherently use less current, so a parallel current path was added to the LED board to compensate.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (Type 5504): Installation of Commander Remote Control Module</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5504-installation-of-commander-remote-control-module/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Sep 2023 17:24:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5504-installation-of-commander-remote-control-module/</guid><description>This article details the installation of a Beolover Commander Remote Control Module into a Beogram 4002 (Type 5504) turntable.
