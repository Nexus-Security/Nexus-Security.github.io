The current standard is 40 Gbps, but companies like XO Communications and Infinera are pushing boundaries by showcasing 100 Gigabit Ethernet on XO&amp;rsquo;s long-haul DWDM network.
This partnership addresses two key requirements: a high-capacity long-haul network and equipment capable of utilizing that capacity...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/100-gige-in-the-long-run/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/100-gige-in-the-long-run/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Big Data Needs Big Bandwidth</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/big-data-needs-big-bandwidth/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Sep 2023 22:07:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/big-data-needs-big-bandwidth/</guid><description>By: John Shepler
Bandwidth is expanding at an incredible rate. Currently, a major infrastructural development is the shift towards 100 Gbps (100 GigE) wavelength services for national and international connections. It seems like only yesterday Gigabit Ethernet was a new concept, impractical for most businesses. These days, GigE is a basic requirement in some fields. What&amp;rsquo;s driving this huge need for more bandwidth?
