This post covers the last board requiring capacitor replacements: the Tone Control &amp;amp; FM Tuning Board. Replacing the ten capacitors on this board is straightforward due to their accessibility. The true challenge lies in cleaning and fixing the three slider controls: Bass, Treble, and Balance.

The Beomaster has been functioning well in the workshop for over a week. It&amp;rsquo;s now safe to reassemble the casing and begin performance testing.
Before I can replace the touch button control and the tone/FM tuning panels, the three display masks for Bass, Treble, and Balance need to be reconnected.
Reinstalling the touch button control panel requires precision...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-pair-of-beomaster-1900-receivers-for-restoration-unit-1-reassembly-for-testing/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-pair-of-beomaster-1900-receivers-for-restoration-unit-1-reassembly-for-testing/</a></p></description></item><item><title>A Pair of Beomaster 1900 Receivers for Restoration: Unit #1 Power Supply Checks and Adjustments</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-pair-of-beomaster-1900-receivers-for-restoration-unit-1-power-supply-checks-and-adjustments/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Sep 2023 21:12:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-pair-of-beomaster-1900-receivers-for-restoration-unit-1-power-supply-checks-and-adjustments/</guid><description>After making some adjustments according to the service manual, everything on the Beomaster 1900 tested out perfectly.
I began by verifying and adjusting the +15 VDC power supply.
While there&amp;rsquo;s no adjustment for the ±31VDC rail voltages, I always check them to ensure everything is as it should be. It&amp;rsquo;s best to identify any issues early on.
To easily measure these voltages, I connected probe wires to the collectors of output transistors IC200 and IC201 underneath the Beomaster...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-pair-of-beomaster-1900-receivers-for-restoration-unit-1-power-supply-checks-and-adjustments/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-pair-of-beomaster-1900-receivers-for-restoration-unit-1-power-supply-checks-and-adjustments/</a></p></description></item><item><title>A Pair of Beomaster 1900 Receivers for Restoration: Unit #1 Power Restored</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-pair-of-beomaster-1900-receivers-for-restoration-unit-1-power-restored/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jun 2023 09:30:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-pair-of-beomaster-1900-receivers-for-restoration-unit-1-power-restored/</guid><description>The first Beomaster 1900 unit is ready for testing after restoration. Testing always starts with powering it on and checking the voltages.
This Beomaster wasn&amp;rsquo;t powering on. Based on my previous observations, I suspected the +15 VDC fuse and the fuse holders. I also found a wire exposed on the main power switch.
I repaired the power switch wiring.

The final testing involved measuring the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) and Frequency Response. Using a dummy 8Ω speaker load, the THD was measured at 1KHz with a 20-watt output. An image of the test setup with the dummy speaker load is provided below.
At the maximum rated power of 20 watts across the dummy speaker load, the THD measured 0.068% using a 1kHz sine wave input to the Beomaster 1900&amp;rsquo;s Tape input...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-pair-of-beomaster-1900-receivers-for-restoration-finishing-up-unit-1/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-pair-of-beomaster-1900-receivers-for-restoration-finishing-up-unit-1/</a></p></description></item><item><title>A Pair of Beomaster 1900 Receivers for Restoration: Installing New Lamps (Unit #1)</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-pair-of-beomaster-1900-receivers-for-restoration-installing-new-lamps-unit-1-/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Dec 2022 02:53:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-pair-of-beomaster-1900-receivers-for-restoration-installing-new-lamps-unit-1-/</guid><description>Today, I replaced all the indicator lamps in the Beomaster 1900.
I switched out the original incandescent Bass, Treble, and Balance indicator lamps with LED/resistor lamp assemblies. This is because incandescent lamps produce more heat, which can be seen in the white spots on the red lamp lenses. LED lamp assemblies generate less heat.
The board shown here originally housed the Bass, Treble, and Balance lamps. Anticipating future needs, I created more LED replacement lamp assemblies than the required three for this project...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-pair-of-beomaster-1900-receivers-for-restoration-installing-new-lamps-unit-1-/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-pair-of-beomaster-1900-receivers-for-restoration-installing-new-lamps-unit-1-/</a></p></description></item><item><title>A Pair of Beomaster 1900 Receivers for Restoration: Initial Assessment of the First One</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-pair-of-beomaster-1900-receivers-for-restoration-initial-assessment-of-the-first-one/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Dec 2022 07:55:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-pair-of-beomaster-1900-receivers-for-restoration-initial-assessment-of-the-first-one/</guid><description>After a short break from posting on the Beolover Blog, I&amp;rsquo;m starting a new restoration project. An owner sent me two Beomaster 1900 receivers, which I completely understand as a Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen collector who owns multiple units of the same component.
Both Beomaster 1900 units appear to be in good cosmetic condition.
Let&amp;rsquo;s begin with the first one.
As previously mentioned, the Beomaster 1900&amp;rsquo;s exterior looks quite good. However, there are a few common issues present...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-pair-of-beomaster-1900-receivers-for-restoration-initial-assessment-of-the-first-one/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-pair-of-beomaster-1900-receivers-for-restoration-initial-assessment-of-the-first-one/</a></p></description></item><item><title>A Pair of Beomaster 1900 Receivers for Restoration: Recapping the Main Board and Volume Control Board (Unit #1)</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-pair-of-beomaster-1900-receivers-for-restoration-recapping-the-main-board-and-volume-control-board-unit-1-/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Nov 2022 09:43:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-pair-of-beomaster-1900-receivers-for-restoration-recapping-the-main-board-and-volume-control-board-unit-1-/</guid><description>The main board and volume control board restoration is finished.
Despite the Beomaster 1900 and 2400 receivers having a small footprint, their restoration is deceptively complex. Replacing the numerous capacitors always serves as a reminder of the intricate internal workings.
Upon arrival, the main board appeared as shown:
After replacing the electrolytic and tantalum capacitors, the main board looked like this:

I had previously removed the heatsinks and their old thermal paste. For this reassembly, I prefer using modern SIL-Pad thermal insulators. They are much cleaner to work with than thermal paste and provide excellent thermal transfer.
Here are the components prepped for reassembly.
