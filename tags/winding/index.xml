The arm lowering mechanism is shown here:
When the control logic initiates arm lowering, the solenoid pushes the solenoid lever forward. The lever opens the solenoid switch when fully extended, decreasing the current flowing through the solenoid to a level just enough to keep it engaged.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002: Restoration of Short Circuited Solenoid Coil and Repair of Main PCB</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-restoration-of-short-circuited-solenoid-coil-and-repair-of-main-pcb/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2022 18:12:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-restoration-of-short-circuited-solenoid-coil-and-repair-of-main-pcb/</guid><description>I recently received a faulty solenoid coil and the main circuit board from a Beogram 4002 turntable belonging to a customer in Texas. I requested the circuit board be sent along with the coil because there&amp;rsquo;s usually an underlying reason why these coils fail, especially in later models of the Beogram 4002 and 4004 turntables.
The components arrived as shown in the image:
My first step was to measure the coil&amp;rsquo;s resistance to verify the customer&amp;rsquo;s diagnosis:</description></item></channel></rss>
