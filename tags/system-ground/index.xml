This was unexpected, as a Beogram 4002 with the same grounding design showed no such issue. The only identifiable difference between the two models was the unshielded mains transformer in the 4000, unlike the shielded transformers in later models. While the relevance of this difference was unclear, it appeared to be the only variable.</description></item></channel></rss>
