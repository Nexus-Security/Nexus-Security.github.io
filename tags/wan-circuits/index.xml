As businesses shift from traditional phone systems and in-house data storage to cloud-based solutions, the reliability of their Wide Area Network (WAN) connections becomes paramount. Network issues that were once minor annoyances can now lead to significant drops in productivity or even complete business disruptions. Ensuring optimal performance of every network connection, whether copper or fiber optic, is crucial. But how can businesses guarantee this level of reliability?</description></item><item><title>Types of Bandwidth for Wide Area Networks</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/types-of-bandwidth-for-wide-area-networks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jun 2023 23:18:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/types-of-bandwidth-for-wide-area-networks/</guid><description>Wide Area Networks (WANs) connect your business to the outside world, encompassing private networks across various locations. These connections, often called &amp;ldquo;long haul circuits&amp;rdquo;, form the foundation of wide area networking.
Connecting your local area network (LAN) to a WAN usually involves a router and a specialized interface corresponding to the WAN circuit type.
A common WAN connection is a T1 line, terminating at a &amp;ldquo;smart jack&amp;rdquo; in your telecom closet.</description></item></channel></rss>
