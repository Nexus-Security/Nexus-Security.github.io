They&amp;rsquo;re not just an extra layer of protection anymoreâ€”they&amp;rsquo;re crucial for safeguarding data.
Let&amp;rsquo;s differentiate between private and virtually private networks. Your physical LAN is a private network, making it difficult for someone to tap into your wiring. Similarly, WANs using dedicated lines (like T1) offer a high level of security, as physically accessing the lines is challenging.</description></item><item><title>Do You Need a Business Cloud?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/do-you-need-a-business-cloud/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2023 02:48:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/do-you-need-a-business-cloud/</guid><description>In the past, telephone calls used dedicated lines that physically connected two parties. This point-to-point system limited network sharing capabilities.
However, packet-switched communications revolutionized this process. Now, constant connections link all locations, while data packets travel across various network pathways. This interconnected network is often visualized as a &amp;ldquo;cloud,&amp;rdquo; where data magically reaches its intended destination. This cloud-based system enables many-to-many communications, contrasting with the previous one-to-one limitation. A prime example is connecting multiple business branches, allowing seamless communication between them without manual intervention.</description></item></channel></rss>
