The power transistor heatsinks, crucial for cooling, have been reinstalled using Sil-Pad insulators for thermal protection. This process started with the power transistors in their original state before any capacitor replacements. After restoration and the addition of new thermal insulation, they were carefully mounted back onto the unit.
To prepare for the upcoming No-Load Current adjustments, test leads were soldered onto the board.</description></item></channel></rss>
