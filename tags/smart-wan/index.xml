However, with the shift from on-site data centers to cloud-based systems, VoIP, and video streaming, our needs have outgrown this simple model. This is where the concept of a Smart WAN comes into play.
Instead of treating all data equally, a Smart WAN prioritizes different types of data through a system called Class of Service (CoS)...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/transforming-the-wan-into-the-smart-wan/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/transforming-the-wan-into-the-smart-wan/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Why The Smart WAN Beats A Dumb Pipe</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/why-the-smart-wan-beats-a-dumb-pipe/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Sep 2022 16:05:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/why-the-smart-wan-beats-a-dumb-pipe/</guid><description>Wide Area Networks (WANs) are traditionally built using &amp;ldquo;dumb pipes,&amp;rdquo; which are simple bandwidth connections between two points. These connections are efficient at their primary function: transferring data packets. However, as IT requirements become more complex, there&amp;rsquo;s a growing need for more intelligent solutions. This can be achieved by either enhancing your internal IT capabilities or outsourcing these needs as a service.
Level 3 Communications, a leading provider of fiber network services, recognizes this shift from basic to high-performance networking demands...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/why-the-smart-wan-beats-a-dumb-pipe/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/why-the-smart-wan-beats-a-dumb-pipe/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
