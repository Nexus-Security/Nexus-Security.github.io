This division provides fiber optic network solutions for businesses of all sizes, with over 28,000 miles of fiber infrastructure already in place and expanding. They are currently establishing two 10 Gigabit Ethernet fiber rings in Ohio and Eastern Pennsylvania, along with a high-speed fiber route between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.
This growth in high-bandwidth infrastructure is driven by the increasing automation and cloud adoption by businesses.</description></item><item><title>Even Lower Latency Connections To Chicago</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/even-lower-latency-connections-to-chicago/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Mar 2024 21:19:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/even-lower-latency-connections-to-chicago/</guid><description>The significance of network latency is evident in AboveNet&amp;rsquo;s efforts to establish faster fiber optic connections, even within a metropolitan area like Chicago, set to launch by the middle of next year. This begs the question: will other cities follow suit?
Latency is the new frontier, surpassing even bandwidth in importance. It represents the critical factor when exceptional computing performance is non-negotiable. This need is especially acute in the financial sector, where companies engaged in stock and commodity trading demand minimal delays.</description></item><item><title>Disaster Recovery Is Now a Service</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/disaster-recovery-is-now-a-service/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Sep 2023 22:06:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/disaster-recovery-is-now-a-service/</guid><description>Imagine a sweltering day with an unsettling stillness in the air, the kind that foreshadows trouble. Suddenly, the sky darkens, wind howls, and a deafening roar consumes everything. You seek shelter as the storm unleashes its fury, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. Emerging from safety, you&amp;rsquo;re met with a scene of utter devastationâ€”your business reduced to rubble.
The image of your business, once full of life, now a wasteland of debris stretching endlessly, is a stark reminder of the destructive power of unforeseen events.</description></item><item><title>Low Latency Fiber Routes To Europe and Asia</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/low-latency-fiber-routes-to-europe-and-asia/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 May 2023 08:56:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/low-latency-fiber-routes-to-europe-and-asia/</guid><description>Numerous American companies establish branches in the UK and Europe, while multinational corporations operate globally. A prevalent solution for connecting these international offices, including cloud services, is low-latency fiber optic routes. The term &amp;ldquo;low latency,&amp;rdquo; once obscure, gained prominence with the shift from traditional phone lines to VoIP. Previously, it primarily described delays in satellite communication.
The question arises: why the emphasis on low-latency fiber routes now? Aren&amp;rsquo;t fiber connections inherently low latency?</description></item></channel></rss>
