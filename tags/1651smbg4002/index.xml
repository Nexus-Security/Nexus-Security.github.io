I had sent the seller specific packaging instructions and a sturdy double-boxed container, which they thankfully followed, resulting in the unit arriving undamaged. Initial observations are as follows:
The aluminum surfaces are generally in good shape, just needing a cleaning. The platter, in particular, has remarkably few imperfections.
The keypad shows typical signs of use, with fingerprints visible on the most frequently pressed keys...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5503-a-first-look/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5503-a-first-look/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5503): Complete Functional Restoration of an AC-Motor Beogram</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5503-complete-functional-restoration-of-an-ac-motor-beogram/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Apr 2023 14:11:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5503-complete-functional-restoration-of-an-ac-motor-beogram/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m restoring a Beogram 4002 Type 5503 turntable from California. This second-generation model uses an AC motor and has the same optical carriage position detection as the later DC motor versions. My initial assessment of the unit before restoration can be found on my blog. I offer the parts I use in my restorations to other enthusiasts â€“ contact me via email or my contact form if interested.
The first step in any Beogram 400x restoration is cleaning and re-lubricating the arm lowering mechanism...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5503-complete-functional-restoration-of-an-ac-motor-beogram/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5503-complete-functional-restoration-of-an-ac-motor-beogram/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5503): Repair of a Dead H-Bridge and Some Other Updates</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5503-repair-of-a-dead-h-bridge-and-some-other-updates/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Apr 2023 12:52:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5503-repair-of-a-dead-h-bridge-and-some-other-updates/</guid><description>A Beogram 4002 turntable, previously restored in 2020, returned for repair. The issue was a familiar one: the carriage wouldn&amp;rsquo;t move towards the platter, suggesting a faulty power transistor in the carriage motor&amp;rsquo;s H-bridge.
This recurring problem has become a pattern, leading to a routine replacement of the H-bridge transistors during restorations. However, this wasn&amp;rsquo;t standard practice in 2020, necessitating the turntable&amp;rsquo;s return for transistor replacement.
Along with the H-bridge transistors, other known problematic components were also updated...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5503-repair-of-a-dead-h-bridge-and-some-other-updates/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5503-repair-of-a-dead-h-bridge-and-some-other-updates/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
