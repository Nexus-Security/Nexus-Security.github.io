Fortunately, there are alternatives to public clouds. Besides public clouds, there are also private clouds and hybrid clouds. Hybrid clouds combine public and private cloud environments, allowing you to run less sensitive applications on the public cloud while maintaining more sensitive data on a private cloud.
While public cloud cost savings are well-known, you might wonder if private clouds offer similar benefits.</description></item><item><title>Computing In The Cloud</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/computing-in-the-cloud/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Dec 2022 15:08:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/computing-in-the-cloud/</guid><description>The term &amp;ldquo;cloud computing&amp;rdquo; has become ubiquitous, but what does it entail and what are its advantages over traditional data centers?
Initially, cloud computing provided access to a network of computers for tasks that exceeded the capabilities of individual resources. A prime example is the SETI@Home program, which harnesses the idle processing power of countless personal computers connected through the internet to analyze radio telescope data in search of extraterrestrial life.</description></item></channel></rss>
