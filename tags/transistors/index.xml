The power transistor heatsinks, crucial for cooling, have been reinstalled using Sil-Pad insulators for thermal protection. This process started with the power transistors in their original state before any capacitor replacements. After restoration and the addition of new thermal insulation, they were carefully mounted back onto the unit.
To prepare for the upcoming No-Load Current adjustments, test leads were soldered onto the board...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-pair-of-beomaster-1900-receivers-for-restoration-unit-2-reassembly-and-power-supply-checks/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-pair-of-beomaster-1900-receivers-for-restoration-unit-2-reassembly-and-power-supply-checks/</a></p></description></item><item><title>A Pair of Beomaster 1900 Receivers for Restoration: Unit #1 Reassembly for Testing and a Power Problem</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-pair-of-beomaster-1900-receivers-for-restoration-unit-1-reassembly-for-testing-and-a-power-problem/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jul 2022 04:33:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-pair-of-beomaster-1900-receivers-for-restoration-unit-1-reassembly-for-testing-and-a-power-problem/</guid><description>Before testing the Beomaster 1900, I needed to reinstall its four output transistors, which are located on the rear heatsinks. I had previously removed the heatsinks and their old thermal paste. For this reassembly, I prefer using modern SIL-Pad thermal insulators. They are much cleaner to work with than thermal paste and provide excellent thermal transfer.
Here are the components prepped for reassembly.
Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen designed a clever mounting system for these transistors...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-pair-of-beomaster-1900-receivers-for-restoration-unit-1-reassembly-for-testing-and-a-power-problem/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-pair-of-beomaster-1900-receivers-for-restoration-unit-1-reassembly-for-testing-and-a-power-problem/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
