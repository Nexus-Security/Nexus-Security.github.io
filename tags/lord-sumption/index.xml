He believes the court continuously expands its interpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights, creating new rights and encroaching on areas that should be determined by elected officials.
Sumption has raised similar concerns previously, stating in 2016 that the ECtHR is at the forefront of creating fundamental law that goes beyond the original text of the Convention.</description></item></channel></rss>
