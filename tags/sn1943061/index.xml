Later that year, I added the Beolover Remote Commander and have enjoyed using it to play records.
This year, I made another enhancement to my Beogram 4004: a Beolover SyncDrive Platter Motor. I was eager to try it out after reading about it on the Beolover Blog.
My Beogram 4004 was already restored and in regular use, with a perfectly functional DC platter motor restored by Beolover in 2021.</description></item></channel></rss>
