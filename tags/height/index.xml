Additional information on this process is available on my Beogram 4000 page, which includes posts and videos. Before starting, I needed to replace the cabinet guiding washers because they were either damaged or replaced with unsuitable substitutes.

A video demonstrating this process is available in my Beogram 4002 playlist on my YouTube channel...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-adjusting-the-platter-floating-chassis-arm-lowering-limits-and-tracking-weight/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-adjusting-the-platter-floating-chassis-arm-lowering-limits-and-tracking-weight/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Adjusting the Chassis Springs and the Platter Height</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-adjusting-the-chassis-springs-and-the-platter-height/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Dec 2022 03:25:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-adjusting-the-chassis-springs-and-the-platter-height/</guid><description>The Beogram 4000 restoration is progressing into the final cosmetic stage. With the turntable functioning correctly, the focus is now on refining the exterior and replacing minor parts like the plug. Currently, I am fine-tuning the platter height, tilt, and the leaf springs supporting the turntable&amp;rsquo;s floating chassis. This is a delicate process with many interconnected factors. The sensor arm&amp;rsquo;s alignment, platter angle, transport lock travel, and belt tension all need to be perfect for the platter to be level, centered, and parallel to the arms, all while ensuring the chassis clears the open locks...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-adjusting-the-chassis-springs-and-the-platter-height/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-adjusting-the-chassis-springs-and-the-platter-height/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): Adjusting Chassis, Platter, Tonearm Limits and Tracking Force</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-adjusting-chassis-platter-tonearm-limits-and-tracking-force/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 May 2022 16:41:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-adjusting-chassis-platter-tonearm-limits-and-tracking-force/</guid><description>My Beogram 4002 (5513) restoration is nearly complete. After adjusting the sub-chassis and platter, I set the tonearm limits and calibrated the tracking force. It&amp;rsquo;s crucial to finalize the platter height before adjusting the arm, ensuring the correct arm-to-platter distance. My YouTube channel has videos demonstrating platter bearing and sub-chassis adjustments, particularly for the Beogram 4000, but the 4002 process is similar.
Here‚Äôs the result:
The platter is now centered and level within the main aluminum plate...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-adjusting-chassis-platter-tonearm-limits-and-tracking-force/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-adjusting-chassis-platter-tonearm-limits-and-tracking-force/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
