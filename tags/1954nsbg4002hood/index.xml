These covers are made using the same injection molding process as the originals, so they have a seamless look, unlike older reproduction covers that were made by fusing together laser-cut pieces. The result is a cover that&amp;rsquo;s indistinguishable from the original.
This photo shows the new cover:
The hinge for the cover was missing the small plastic pieces that prevent the spring mechanism from rubbing against the hinge&amp;rsquo;s metal parts.</description></item></channel></rss>
