The keypad is now responsive, but the cueing up and down button is overly sensitive and needs further attention.
The RPM panel re-installation was put on hold because the plastic mounting fixtures were cracked, a common issue with Beogram 4002 turntables. I was fortunate that the cracks weren&amp;rsquo;t severe and the fixtures were still usable. To repair them, I used acrylic repair fluid while pressing the pieces together...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-service-manual-adjustments-preparing-for-use/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-service-manual-adjustments-preparing-for-use/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): Electrical Work and Initial Tracking Adjustment</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-electrical-work-and-initial-tracking-adjustment/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Sep 2023 15:12:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-electrical-work-and-initial-tracking-adjustment/</guid><description>Let&amp;rsquo;s begin restoring the electronic boards. The main control board needs its capacitors replaced and the RPM relay (along with the RPM trimmers) need attention. Additionally, the output board requires inspection of its phono muting circuit. It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that aside from wiring, the muting relay is the sole electrical part interacting with the phono audio signal. The turntable&amp;rsquo;s electronics mainly manage the platter motor, tangential arm, indicator lamps, and user controls, none of which are part of the audio pathway...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-electrical-work-and-initial-tracking-adjustment/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-electrical-work-and-initial-tracking-adjustment/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
