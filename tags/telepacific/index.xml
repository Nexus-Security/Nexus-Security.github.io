This SIP trunking solution provides both voice and data over a single line. Unlike traditional Integrated T1 lines, SmartVoice stands out by supporting various business telephone systems and offering significantly greater traffic capacity.
SIP trunking uses an IP-based transmission line specifically designed for enterprise VoIP telephone systems. SIP, or Session Initiation Protocol, is the signaling technology employed by numerous IP phone systems...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/telepacific-s-smartvoice-trunking-offers-telephone-smarts/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/telepacific-s-smartvoice-trunking-offers-telephone-smarts/</a></p></description></item><item><title>IP WAN over MPLS Advantages</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ip-wan-over-mpls-advantages/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Feb 2024 05:22:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ip-wan-over-mpls-advantages/</guid><description>The internet is often the first thing that comes to mind when considering IP wide area networks. Although it boasts near-universal accessibility and relatively low access costs, it presents significant drawbacks for business use. Factors like bandwidth, latency, jitter, and packet loss lack guarantees and predictability. Additionally, security on the internet is unreliable. However, are alternative methods for interconnecting business locations excessively expensive or difficult to manage?
It&amp;rsquo;s feasible to establish a private IP network that enables the use of your existing IP addressing system, eliminating the need for encryption, firewalls, tunnels, or supplementary hardware...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ip-wan-over-mpls-advantages/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ip-wan-over-mpls-advantages/</a></p></description></item><item><title>10 Mbps Is The New T1</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/10-mbps-is-the-new-t1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jan 2024 11:30:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/10-mbps-is-the-new-t1/</guid><description>The longstanding leading connectivity solution for businesses, T1 service, is frequently used for dedicated internet connections, point-to-point private lines, and PBX phone trunks. T1 connections are easily accessible, cost-effective, and very dependable. However, their main selling point—fixed bandwidth of 1.5 Mbps—is now a significant drawback.
While 1.5 Mbps still satisfies the needs of many small businesses and less tech-dependent companies, this is changing quickly. Professionals in fields like insurance, medicine, video production, and engineering all require strong connections...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/10-mbps-is-the-new-t1/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/10-mbps-is-the-new-t1/</a></p></description></item><item><title>California and Nevada Get 200 Mbps Bandwidth over Copper</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/california-and-nevada-get-200-mbps-bandwidth-over-copper/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Nov 2023 17:58:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/california-and-nevada-get-200-mbps-bandwidth-over-copper/</guid><description>The demand for business bandwidth has increased significantly over the past ten years. Companies that once relied on T1 lines (1.5 to 12 Mbps) or DS3 (45 Mbps) now require speeds exceeding 100 Mbps to accommodate high-definition video, large datasets, and cloud-based services.
Obtaining up to 200 Mbps over multiple copper pairs is now much simpler for businesses in California and Nevada. While achieving such speeds with fiber optic connections (SONET or Ethernet over Fiber) is not difficult, the installation of fiber optic cables presents a significant obstacle...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/california-and-nevada-get-200-mbps-bandwidth-over-copper/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/california-and-nevada-get-200-mbps-bandwidth-over-copper/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Ethernet over Fixed Wireless Broadband</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-over-fixed-wireless-broadband/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jul 2023 01:04:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-over-fixed-wireless-broadband/</guid><description>Businesses are discovering the advantages of Metro Ethernet over traditional copper and fiber optic cables. However, there&amp;rsquo;s a lesser-known alternative: Ethernet over Fixed Wireless, offering a fast and budget-friendly way to get the bandwidth you need.
Ethernet over Fixed Wireless (EoFW) is distinct from familiar portable or mobile wireless services like WiFi, WiMAX, or LTE. While these offer broadband within a defined area for general, unencrypted use, their bandwidth is limited and shared, resulting in unpredictable connection speeds...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-over-fixed-wireless-broadband/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-over-fixed-wireless-broadband/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
