However, I wanted to remind you about the specific resources available to Dynamics partners. You can find links to these on https://mbs.microsoft.com/partnersource/resources/discussions/.
Beyond public forums, there are private ones exclusively for partners and, my favorite, the partner online technical communities managed by Microsoft Dynamics support. These communities offer a valuable way to expand your knowledge base and utilize your support plan without submitting a formal case.</description></item></channel></rss>
