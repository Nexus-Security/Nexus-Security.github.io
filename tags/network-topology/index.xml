Traditionally, this meant converting between protocols, which was inefficient. However, Metro and Carrier Ethernet connections now offer a seamless way to link LANs and WANs.
Packet-based networks, especially those using IP, benefit significantly from using the same technology across the entire network.</description></item><item><title>Benefits Of An MPLS Mesh Network</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/benefits-of-an-mpls-mesh-network/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 May 2023 11:01:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/benefits-of-an-mpls-mesh-network/</guid><description>When your company grows to have multiple locations like branches, data centers, or factories, you&amp;rsquo;ll need a way to connect them all on the same network. The best way to do this is with an MPLS Mesh Network.
Smaller companies with only two locations usually start by connecting the locations with a point-to-point T1 or Ethernet line. While this works, using an MPLS network might be more cost-effective depending on the distance between locations and the availability of T1 or Ethernet services.</description></item></channel></rss>
