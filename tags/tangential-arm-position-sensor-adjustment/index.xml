The final phase involved service manual checks and adjustments, along with calibrating the record detection, arm position, and tracking sensors.
Following a guide, the record detection sensor was calibrated by adjusting the 1TR3 collector voltage to 4 VDC for an empty, spinning platter. This voltage should remain consistent with a record on the platter.
Next, the tangential arm position sensor was adjusted to achieve 5 VDC at the 4IC1 collector when illuminated by the sensor lamp through a transparent part of the position scale.</description></item></channel></rss>
