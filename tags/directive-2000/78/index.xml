The Court of Justice recently issued five significant decisions regarding Directive 2000/78&amp;rsquo;s provisions on religious discrimination, a topic it hadn&amp;rsquo;t addressed in many years. This surge in rulings signifies the Court&amp;rsquo;s renewed focus on this area.
The latest case originated from Austria&amp;rsquo;s Supreme Court and concerned a law granting paid holidays on Good Friday to members of three minor Christian denominations, excluding others.</description></item><item><title>Can salvation be found outside of the church?

Background
The Court of Justice issued a significant decision concerning the balance between religious organizations&amp;rsquo; autonomy and the right of their employees (or potential employees) to be free from discrimination.
In 2012, Vera Egenberger applied for a temporary position with the Evangelisches Werk für Diakonie und Entwicklung, an organization affiliated with the Evangelische Kirche in Deutschland (a German Protestant church).</description></item><item><title>Is there a conflict or disagreement between the European Court of Justice and the Danish Constitutional Court?

The Danish Supreme Court recently issued its judgment in the Ajos case, concerning the scope of the EU employment equality Directive and age discrimination. This decision follows a ruling from the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) that provided two paths for the Danish court: interpret national law in harmony with the Directive or disapply conflicting national provisions.</description></item><item><title>Can obesity be considered a disability?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/can-obesity-be-considered-a-disability/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2024 19:13:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/can-obesity-be-considered-a-disability/</guid><description>By Katharina Ó Cathaoir, PhD Fellow, University of Copenhagen

Does being obese qualify as a disability? This complex issue was the focus of Advocate General Jääskinen&amp;rsquo;s opinion on July 17, 2014, in the case of Kaltoft v. Municipality of Billund. The case has drawn significant interest, particularly regarding potential impacts on employment and healthcare. However, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to note that the Advocate General&amp;rsquo;s opinion is not legally binding and the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) will issue its own judgment in the coming months.</description></item><item><title>The CJEU has confirmed that self-employed workers are protected from discrimination, including on the basis of sexual orientation, under anti-discrimination and labor rights laws.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-has-confirmed-that-self-employed-workers-are-protected-from-discrimination-including-on-the-basis-of-sexual-orientation-under-anti-discrimination-and-labor-rights-laws/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jan 2024 21:27:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-has-confirmed-that-self-employed-workers-are-protected-from-discrimination-including-on-the-basis-of-sexual-orientation-under-anti-discrimination-and-labor-rights-laws/</guid><description>A Closer Look at Worker Protections: Analyzing the ECJ&amp;rsquo;s Ruling in Case C-356/21 By Chiara De Capitani, linguist agent at the European Commission and PhD candidate and honorary fellow in European law at the University of Naples “L&amp;rsquo;Orientale”.

Despite coming into effect in 2003, the Framework Directive on Discrimination in Employment&amp;rsquo;s impact on religion-related matters remained unclear for 14 years until a series of landmark decisions by the Court of Justice. These rulings have clarified the EU&amp;rsquo;s stance on religious expression in the workplace.
It is now established that a consistently applied workplace neutrality policy prohibiting religious symbols is considered indirectly, not directly, discriminatory (the Achbita case).</description></item><item><title>The European Commission's reflections on the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities focus more on praise than introspection.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-european-commission-s-reflections-on-the-un-convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities-focus-more-on-praise-than-introspection/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Nov 2023 15:44:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-european-commission-s-reflections-on-the-un-convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities-focus-more-on-praise-than-introspection/</guid><description>Dr. Charlotte O’Brien, Lecturer in Law, York Law School, University of York
Over seven years after signing the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) and over three years after its conclusion, how effectively is the EU safeguarding the disability rights outlined within it? The European Commission claims it is doing very well. In fact, it suggests the UNCRPD was hardly necessary, as the EU was already on the right track.</description></item><item><title>Contemplating EU Gender Equality Law on Surrogate Mothers' Day in Court</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/contemplating-eu-gender-equality-law-on-surrogate-mothers-day-in-court/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Oct 2023 21:57:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/contemplating-eu-gender-equality-law-on-surrogate-mothers-day-in-court/</guid><description>Steve Peers
The desire to have children has always been deeply understood, especially for women facing medical obstacles to childbirth. Adoption was the traditional solution, but recent decades have introduced alternatives like IVF and surrogacy.
While the EU doesn&amp;rsquo;t directly regulate these practices, it does address maternity leave through the Pregnant Workers&amp;rsquo; Directive. The Directive on Sex Discrimination in Employment further tackles the employment aspects of pregnancy. This directive prohibits discrimination against women undergoing IVF treatment even before pregnancy, as established by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in the Mayr case.</description></item><item><title>Expanding the margin of appreciation: France's prohibition on public face-veiling</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/expanding-the-margin-of-appreciation-france-s-prohibition-on-public-face-veiling/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Aug 2023 05:03:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/expanding-the-margin-of-appreciation-france-s-prohibition-on-public-face-veiling/</guid><description>The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has ruled on a highly anticipated case, SAS v France, concerning France&amp;rsquo;s 2010 law prohibiting face coverings in public.

Nearly two decades after the Framework Directive on discrimination in employment was implemented, the Court of Justice issued its first significant decisions regarding workplace discrimination based on religion. These rulings placed the Court in a politically sensitive area, presenting considerable risk for an international judicial body like the CJEU.</description></item><item><title>Dr. David L. Parris v.

Introduction
The recent ruling in the Parris case represents a missed chance for the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to provide meaningful protection to LGB individuals and same-sex couples under EU law. While recent cases like Asociaţia Accept and Hay suggested a shift towards stronger protection of LGB rights, the ECJ&amp;rsquo;s judgment in Parris, similar to the Léger case preceding it, reveals a hesitancy to address matters considered sensitive by Member States.</description></item><item><title>Explaining the European Court of Justice's decisions on headscarf bans in the workplace</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/explaining-the-european-court-of-justice-s-decisions-on-headscarf-bans-in-the-workplace/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2023 22:54:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/explaining-the-european-court-of-justice-s-decisions-on-headscarf-bans-in-the-workplace/</guid><description>Professor Steve Peers
The European Court of Justice (ECJ) recently issued rulings on whether employers can prohibit employees from wearing headscarves at work. These rulings have garnered significant attention, although some of it stems from misunderstandings. This post aims to provide a clear explanation of the rulings.
Background
The EU has established laws against discrimination based on sex, nationality, race, disability, age, sexual orientation, and religion. While the ECJ has frequently addressed cases related to the first three grounds, the recent judgments in G4S v Achbita and Bougnaoui mark the first instance where the court has been asked to interpret workplace discrimination based on religious grounds.</description></item><item><title>Further information regarding the horizontal direct impact of the principle of age nondiscrimination can be found in the case of Dansk Industries (DI).</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/further-information-regarding-the-horizontal-direct-impact-of-the-principle-of-age-nondiscrimination-can-be-found-in-the-case-of-dansk-industries-di/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Aug 2022 08:53:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/further-information-regarding-the-horizontal-direct-impact-of-the-principle-of-age-nondiscrimination-can-be-found-in-the-case-of-dansk-industries-di/</guid><description>Giovanni Zaccaroni, Ph.D (University of Bologna), Junior lawyer FratiniVergano The Court of Justice, in the recent DI case, further defined the differences in applying rights derived from Directive 2000/78/EC, which prohibits employment discrimination based on religion, disability, sexual orientation, and age, and the general principle of non-discrimination based on age in employment matters.
This builds upon previous landmark cases like Mangold and Kucukdeveci. In these cases, the Court addressed the obligation to prevent age discrimination in employment when challenged by national laws.</description></item><item><title>What approach should the CJEU take in addressing religious discrimination in the workplace?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-approach-should-the-cjeu-take-in-addressing-religious-discrimination-in-the-workplace/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jun 2022 13:46:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-approach-should-the-cjeu-take-in-addressing-religious-discrimination-in-the-workplace/</guid><description>Ronan McCrea*

The European Court of Justice, in its decision on Kaltoft, determined that obesity itself is not a protected characteristic under EU employment law, nor is it automatically a disability. However, the Court acknowledged that the EU Directive prohibiting workplace discrimination based on disability might apply in certain situations. It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that this ruling specifically pertains to employment disputes, as EU law does not address disability discrimination outside of the workplace.</description></item><item><title>The Court of Justice provides clarification on when employers can prohibit headscarves in the workplace.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-court-of-justice-provides-clarification-on-when-employers-can-prohibit-headscarves-in-the-workplace/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2022 09:34:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-court-of-justice-provides-clarification-on-when-employers-can-prohibit-headscarves-in-the-workplace/</guid><description>Professor Ronan McCrea, University College London
The Court of Justice&amp;rsquo;s initial significant decisions concerning workplace policies limiting religious symbols were issued four years ago in the G4S and Micropole cases. These rulings addressed the compatibility of these policies with the Framework Directive on discrimination in employment (Directive 2000/78).
In these decisions, the Court&amp;rsquo;s Grand Chamber determined that requiring employees to maintain visible religious neutrality constituted indirect rather than direct discrimination, provided this policy was uniformly applied to all religions or beliefs.</description></item></channel></rss>
