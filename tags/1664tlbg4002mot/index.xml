Initial inspection showed no obvious external issues.
However, a bench test revealed the rotor was blocked, preventing the motor from spinning.
Upon disassembly, it was evident that someone had previously attempted a repair: the brushes were deformed and a pickup coil pin was broken. Further disassembly revealed a loose and disconnected coil near the missing pin.
To address potential bearing issues, the bearings were submerged in motor oil and a vacuum was applied.</description></item></channel></rss>
