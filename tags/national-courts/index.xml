A major issue for the EU is whether to sign and provisionally implement CETA, the free trade agreement with Canada. How this power is divided between the EU and its Member States is important, as it determines whether individual countries could veto parts or all of the agreement. This situation is complex, potentially hindering the deal&amp;rsquo;s proponents while empowering its critics.</description></item><item><title>Has the European Court of Justice shifted from being an offender to a protector of human rights in the context of the European Arrest Warrant?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/has-the-european-court-of-justice-shifted-from-being-an-offender-to-a-protector-of-human-rights-in-the-context-of-the-european-arrest-warrant/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 04:52:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/has-the-european-court-of-justice-shifted-from-being-an-offender-to-a-protector-of-human-rights-in-the-context-of-the-european-arrest-warrant/</guid><description>Steve Peers*
Since its rushed creation after the 9/11 attacks, the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) has become a cornerstone of EU criminal law. It replaces traditional extradition with a streamlined system lacking most of the usual limitations. This has worried critics concerned about potential miscarriages of justice but pleased supporters who appreciate the faster return of more fugitives to face justice.
Despite concerns from some EU countries&amp;rsquo; constitutional courts, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has long dismissed human rights criticisms of the EAW.</description></item><item><title>Is there a conflict or disagreement between the European Court of Justice and the Danish Constitutional Court?

The Danish Supreme Court recently issued its judgment in the Ajos case, concerning the scope of the EU employment equality Directive and age discrimination.

As the playwright Eugene Ionesco once said, predictions are only possible after events have occurred.
Last Thursday, the Polish Supreme Court presented the European Court of Justice with a request for a preliminary ruling. This type of request, outlined in Article 267 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, is used to clarify questions regarding EU law. In doing so, the Polish court also paused the enforcement of a Polish law mandating early retirement for Supreme Court justices over 65.</description></item><item><title>The CJEU clarifies CILFIT regarding the final courts' obligations to refer questions.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-clarifies-cilfit-regarding-the-final-courts-obligations-to-refer-questions/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jan 2024 19:34:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-clarifies-cilfit-regarding-the-final-courts-obligations-to-refer-questions/</guid><description>Daniel Sarmiento, Professor of EU Law at the University Complutense of Madrid*

The October 19th decision by the Vice-President of the Court of Justice concerning Poland&amp;rsquo;s Judiciary Reform Act is groundbreaking. This decision, which orders Poland to halt the implementation of the Act and prevents the removal of judges due to the new retirement age, represents uncharted territory. It places the Court of Justice in the unprecedented position of compelling a sovereign member state to decide between adhering to European integration principles or embracing illiberalism.</description></item><item><title>The Court of Justice of the European Union will soon examine important legal matters related to EU sanctions against non-EU countries.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-court-of-justice-of-the-european-union-will-soon-examine-important-legal-matters-related-to-eu-sanctions-against-non-eu-countries/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Oct 2023 14:46:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-court-of-justice-of-the-european-union-will-soon-examine-important-legal-matters-related-to-eu-sanctions-against-non-eu-countries/</guid><description>Stian Øby Johansen, PhD fellow at the University of Oslo Faculty of Law*

Despite being an EU member for fifteen years, Maltese courts have been hesitant to refer legal interpretation questions to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). This could change with a case that has significant implications for the direct effect of EU member states&amp;rsquo; rule of law and human rights obligations.

The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) acknowledged the significant contributions of its British members to European integration and legal precedent. This recognition prompts reflection on the impact of British legal professionals on EU law, particularly in the areas of migration and free movement.
British judges and advocates-general, with their common law background, played a key role in shaping the CJEU into a more transparent and adaptable institution.</description></item><item><title>The Role of Non-Legal Stability Factors in Ensuring Legal Certainty in the Preliminary Reference Procedure (Elgar 2022)</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-role-of-non-legal-stability-factors-in-ensuring-legal-certainty-in-the-preliminary-reference-procedure-elgar-2022/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jun 2023 04:32:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-role-of-non-legal-stability-factors-in-ensuring-legal-certainty-in-the-preliminary-reference-procedure-elgar-2022/</guid><description>John Cotter, Lecturer in Law, School of Law, Keele University
A common saying, often credited to Benjamin Franklin, states that only death and taxes are inevitable. If we interpret &amp;ldquo;certainty&amp;rdquo; literally, legal professionals trying to anticipate the results of a case might concur. Predicting court outcomes involves significant challenges. Some stem from ambiguity within legal rules themselves, stemming from the limits of language in conveying meaning (&amp;ldquo;legal obstacles&amp;rdquo;). Others arise from external factors that influence how rules are selected, interpreted, and applied to a case (&amp;ldquo;extra-legal obstacles&amp;rdquo;).</description></item><item><title>The Court of Justice of the European Union alters its stance on anonymity in cases</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-court-of-justice-of-the-european-union-alters-its-stance-on-anonymity-in-cases/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jun 2023 00:05:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-court-of-justice-of-the-european-union-alters-its-stance-on-anonymity-in-cases/</guid><description>Peter Oliver, Honorary Professor at the Université Libre de Bruxelles

In June 2018, the Court of Justice announced its decision to alter its handling of personal data in preliminary ruling requests. Citing the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Court stated its commitment to safeguarding the data of individuals involved in these cases while upholding transparency and public access to court proceedings.
Starting July 2018, the names of individuals in all public documents related to preliminary rulings would be replaced with initials, not their actual ones, alongside a brief description of the case subject matter.</description></item><item><title>Is Poland violating the principle of effective judicial protection?

While the Court of Justice plays a significant role in enforcing EU law through infringement and preliminary ruling procedures (Articles 258 and 267 TFEU, respectively), it has largely been excluded from enforcing EU values, particularly the rule of law.

EU Member States are nearing the deadline to implement the EU Damages Directive. This directive aims to empower consumers and small businesses to seek damages from parties who violate competition law.
Although the need for such a directive was questioned in the past, the current perspective has significantly shifted. Nevertheless, adapting to this new approach presents ongoing challenges.
Background
Adopted in December 2014, the Directive mandates that all EU and EEA member states ensure individuals and entities impacted by competition law violations can claim and receive full compensation for their losses.</description></item><item><title>Close partners: The highest courts of member states and the enforcement of EU legislation</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/close-partners-the-highest-courts-of-member-states-and-the-enforcement-of-eu-legislation/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Dec 2022 11:28:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/close-partners-the-highest-courts-of-member-states-and-the-enforcement-of-eu-legislation/</guid><description>Daniel Sarmiento, Professor of EU Law at the University Complutense of Madrid*

Introduction
The Elgizouli case marks the first UK Supreme Court ruling on the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA). The key takeaway is that simply mostly complying with the Act&amp;rsquo;s requirements isn&amp;rsquo;t enough to legalize data transfers to other countries. This judgment centers around Part Three of the DPA, which puts the Law Enforcement Directive into action and emphasizes procedural safeguards. However, the court&amp;rsquo;s methodology might have broader consequences for how UK courts interpret the DPA and the GDPR, particularly regarding the protection of individual rights outlined in the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).</description></item><item><title>Mario's feet were pulled out from under him by the BVerfG and the ECB's OMT programme.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/mario-s-feet-were-pulled-out-from-under-him-by-the-bverfg-and-the-ecb-s-omt-programme/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jul 2022 10:50:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/mario-s-feet-were-pulled-out-from-under-him-by-the-bverfg-and-the-ecb-s-omt-programme/</guid><description>By Ioannis Glinavos (@iGlinavos), Senior Lecturer, University of Westminster
