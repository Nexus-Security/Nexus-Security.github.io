After changing the control panel lights, it became obvious that the 45 RPM button lit up the correct trimmer pot but the motor speed didn&amp;rsquo;t change. The issue was a faulty relay that was responsible for switching resistor networks within the Wien oscillator&amp;rsquo;s feedback loop to adjust the resonance frequency.
Finding a replacement relay for vintage electronics can be tricky...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-replacement-of-a-stuck-rpm-relay-with-a-modern-encapsulated-smd-relay/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-replacement-of-a-stuck-rpm-relay-with-a-modern-encapsulated-smd-relay/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5501): Repair of a Strange Fault Caused by a Shorted Diode D6</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5501-repair-of-a-strange-fault-caused-by-a-shorted-diode-d6/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Sep 2023 22:47:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5501-repair-of-a-strange-fault-caused-by-a-shorted-diode-d6/</guid><description>During the restoration of a Beogram 4002 (5501) turntable, a peculiar control system issue persisted even after replacing the reservoir capacitors.
Upon pressing START, the carriage would begin to move but halt after approximately 20 mm, coinciding with the lights turning off. A few seconds later, the lights would illuminate again, and the motor would operate at 45 RPM. In this state, the carriage could be moved using the &amp;raquo; &amp;laquo; buttons, but the arm lowering function was disabled...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5501-repair-of-a-strange-fault-caused-by-a-shorted-diode-d6/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5501-repair-of-a-strange-fault-caused-by-a-shorted-diode-d6/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
