Election laws typically set the stage but don&amp;rsquo;t directly determine the winner, although there are notable exceptions like the 2000 US election.
The 2014 Commission President election is unique because the rules changed, and their interpretation is debated. Previously, the European Council appointed the President after European Parliament approval. The Treaty of Lisbon introduced new rules, applied for the first time, stating the Parliament &amp;ldquo;elects&amp;rdquo; the President based on the Council&amp;rsquo;s nomination, &amp;ldquo;taking account&amp;rdquo; of Parliament election results...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-appropriate-for-the-outcome-of-the-european-parliament-elections-to-dictate-the-selection-of-the-next-president-of-the-european-commission-or-are-there-valid-concerns-about-this-democratic-process/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-appropriate-for-the-outcome-of-the-european-parliament-elections-to-dictate-the-selection-of-the-next-president-of-the-european-commission-or-are-there-valid-concerns-about-this-democratic-process/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Should legitimacy be prioritized in the further development of the EMU, or should it be considered as a secondary concern?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/should-legitimacy-be-prioritized-in-the-further-development-of-the-emu-or-should-it-be-considered-as-a-secondary-concern/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 May 2023 16:56:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/should-legitimacy-be-prioritized-in-the-further-development-of-the-emu-or-should-it-be-considered-as-a-secondary-concern/</guid><description>PÃ¤ivi Leino-Sandberg: Adjunct Professor of EU Law, Academy of Finland Research Fellow, University of Helsinki
In June 2012, the European Council outlined &amp;ldquo;four essential building blocks&amp;rdquo; for the future of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU): integrated frameworks for finance, budget, and economic policy, and enhanced democratic legitimacy and accountability. The European Council emphasized ensuring democratic legitimacy and accountability at all levels of decision-making and implementation, stating that stronger economic governance requires stronger legitimacy and accountability...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/should-legitimacy-be-prioritized-in-the-further-development-of-the-emu-or-should-it-be-considered-as-a-secondary-concern/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/should-legitimacy-be-prioritized-in-the-further-development-of-the-emu-or-should-it-be-considered-as-a-secondary-concern/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The Future of Europe: A Preview of the Five Presidents' Report on EMU Completion</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-future-of-europe-a-preview-of-the-five-presidents-report-on-emu-completion/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jun 2022 14:49:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-future-of-europe-a-preview-of-the-five-presidents-report-on-emu-completion/</guid><description>Menelaos Markakis, DPhil student at University of Oxford, Academy of Athens scholar

This report, based on crisis-combatting measures, offers numerous suggestions for improving the EMU&amp;rsquo;s governance and deepening economic integration within the Euro area. The EU Presidents suggest advancing towards a unified economic, financial, fiscal, and political system...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-future-of-europe-a-preview-of-the-five-presidents-report-on-emu-completion/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-future-of-europe-a-preview-of-the-five-presidents-report-on-emu-completion/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
