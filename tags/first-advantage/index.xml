This issue is particularly prominent in Australia, where 12% of candidates were found to have significant discrepancies on their resumes. The company noted a higher rate of alerts related to criminal records and employment history checks among Australian candidates compared to other countries.
First Advantage recommends that companies implement screening practices not only to comply with industry regulations, ensure employee competence, and mitigate physical, legal, and financial risks but also to safeguard their brand reputation.</description></item></channel></rss>
