This piece fits into a 10mm opening on the remote control receiver board, allowing it to be secured using one of the main PCB&amp;rsquo;s screws. The image below shows the part with the screw in place:
Once the remote control board is in place, the original screw can be used to fasten it. The cylindrical portion is designed to prevent the remote board from pressing against the component pins on the Beogram&amp;rsquo;s main PCB while ensuring a secure fit...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-remote-control-final-3d-printed-part-added/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-remote-control-final-3d-printed-part-added/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513) Remote Control: Now With a 3D Printed Installation Tray</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-remote-control-now-with-a-3d-printed-installation-tray/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Dec 2023 09:02:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-remote-control-now-with-a-3d-printed-installation-tray/</guid><description>This post continues the discussion about my Beogram 4002 (5513) remote control upgrade, specifically the receiver board insulation. My previous solution, using plastic foil, wasn&amp;rsquo;t ideal aesthetically.
To address this, I designed a plastic tray that safeguards the receiver board from the main circuit board&amp;rsquo;s solder points. The tray is designed to click into place without additional screws.
Here are some photos:
Tray and board before assembly:
The tray features three rectangular cutouts to provide clearance for the solder points...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-remote-control-now-with-a-3d-printed-installation-tray/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-remote-control-now-with-a-3d-printed-installation-tray/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513) Remote Control: Now With a Professionally Made PCB</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-remote-control-now-with-a-professionally-made-pcb/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 May 2023 13:38:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-remote-control-now-with-a-professionally-made-pcb/</guid><description>I recently had a professionally made circuit board manufactured for the remote control receiver in my Beogram 4002 (5513). It was exciting to see the new board arrive and start assembling it.
The biggest changes in this design were simplifying the assembly by placing all the components on the top side and repositioning the ISP port to avoid interference with the aluminum top panel fixture. I also removed the reset button and made more space for the keypad connector...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-remote-control-now-with-a-professionally-made-pcb/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-remote-control-now-with-a-professionally-made-pcb/</a></p></description></item><item><title>An Early Christmas!

It was a fantastic day! The Beogram 6000, complete with an MMC6000 cartridge, is in fantastic cosmetic shape. All the keypads look almost brand new, the veneer is in excellent condition, and it even includes replacement plexiglass components. It even came with all of the original owner&amp;rsquo;s manuals and service manuals, including the Beomaster 6000&amp;rsquo;s German &amp;ldquo;Technische Produktbeschreibung&amp;rdquo; (product description)!..<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/an-early-christmas-beosystem-6000-is-in-the-house-/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/an-early-christmas-beosystem-6000-is-in-the-house-/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002: Apple Remote Controls All Functions of Turntable</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-apple-remote-controls-all-functions-of-turntable/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Nov 2022 14:16:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-apple-remote-controls-all-functions-of-turntable/</guid><description>After several weeks of testing, I&amp;rsquo;m excited to share my latest creation: a remote control receiver designed specifically for the Beogram 4002 (5513 model) turntable. This receiver seamlessly integrates with the turntable&amp;rsquo;s existing keypad connector without affecting its functionality.
The receiver board is compatible with the latest Apple TV remote, chosen for its sleek aluminum design that complements the Beogram 4002&amp;rsquo;s aesthetic. The remote&amp;rsquo;s minimalist button layout also aligns perfectly with the turntable&amp;rsquo;s functions...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-apple-remote-controls-all-functions-of-turntable/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-apple-remote-controls-all-functions-of-turntable/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
