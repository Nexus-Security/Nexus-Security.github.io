Suddenly, the typical workplace is no more. The usual routines of office life have vanished. Employees are no longer commuting to their desks. Cubicles and parking lots are deserted. Countless desktop computers and phones sit idle.
The New Normal: Where is Everyone?
A small team remains onsite, but the majority of employees are working from home. There&amp;rsquo;s been a massive effort to establish remote connections using personal computers, iPads, and smartphones, relying on cable and cellular broadband...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/you-are-definitely-going-to-need-more-bandwidth/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/you-are-definitely-going-to-need-more-bandwidth/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Dedicated vs Shared Internet</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/dedicated-vs-shared-internet/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jan 2024 09:06:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/dedicated-vs-shared-internet/</guid><description>By: John Shepler
When choosing business internet services, bandwidth is important, but understanding the difference between dedicated and shared connections is crucial.
What Does Dedicated Mean?
Dedicated bandwidth is exclusively for your use. This might seem obvious, but the recent rise of shared bandwidth makes it worth clarifying. The cost-effectiveness of shared bandwidth often makes businesses reconsider their need for a dedicated line.
Cost Considerations
Shared bandwidth is significantly cheaper than dedicated bandwidth at similar speeds...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/dedicated-vs-shared-internet/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/dedicated-vs-shared-internet/</a></p></description></item><item><title>When More Bandwidth Doesnâ€™t Help</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/when-more-bandwidth-doesn-t-help/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jan 2024 06:30:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/when-more-bandwidth-doesn-t-help/</guid><description>You&amp;rsquo;re likely aware of this situation: your reliable internet connection, a T1 line or DS3 circuit, has suddenly become sluggish. Your VoIP calls sound distant, employees struggle to work, and frustrated customers can&amp;rsquo;t even communicate properly. The obvious solution seems to be getting more bandwidth, right?
While that seems logical, doubling your internet speed might not solve the problem, leaving you with the same issues and double the cost.

Many believe that 10 Mbps Ethernet is replacing traditional T1 lines, and for good reason. This article will explore why that is, how this technology works, and the steps to upgrade.
Businesses have relied on T1 lines for decades due to their high reliability, guaranteed bandwidth of 1.5 Mbps, and symmetrical upload and download speeds. Prices have also decreased over time, and availability is now widespread.
The main drawback of T1 lines is their limited bandwidth...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/10x10-mbps-ethernet-providers-in-demand/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/10x10-mbps-ethernet-providers-in-demand/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Why Managed MPLS Networking Services</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/why-managed-mpls-networking-services/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 May 2023 09:09:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/why-managed-mpls-networking-services/</guid><description>Imagine your company with offices across the country, each operating its own independent local network for computers, phones, and video calls.
