The new traditional board games stamp issue.
Singapore Post (SingPost) is releasing a new set of five square stamps on April 27th. Each stamp features a hand-drawn image of a traditional board game popular in Singapore during the 1970s and 80s: Chinese chess, the diamond game, aeroplane chess, snakes and ladders, and checkers.
Chinese chess (1st local denomination) is a strategic board game for two players simulating a battle between two armies.</description></item></channel></rss>
