The L805 ink tank photo printer.
Epson, a company that provides digital imaging and printing products, has released its L805 printer. This six-color ink tank photo printer offers wireless printing from mobile devices and boasts the lowest operating expenses on the market. Epson&amp;rsquo;s ink tank printers are unique in that they utilize large ink tanks instead of cartridges.
Building upon the previous L800 model, the L805 incorporates built-in wireless connectivity...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-l805-photo-printer-from-epson-features-a-six-colour-ink-tank-system/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-l805-photo-printer-from-epson-features-a-six-colour-ink-tank-system/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Canon Singapore will be hosting the Photo Marathon again in August 2015</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/canon-singapore-will-be-hosting-the-photo-marathon-again-in-august-2015/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Dec 2023 20:36:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/canon-singapore-will-be-hosting-the-photo-marathon-again-in-august-2015/</guid><description>Source: Canon eDM.
Canon Singapore has announced the details for their 13th annual Photo Marathon, taking place on August 22nd from 7 am to 8 pm at the Marina Bay Sands Expo and Convention Centre, Level 1, Hall C.
The competition revolves around three photography themes that are revealed on the day of the event. Participants are tasked with capturing these themes in their photographs and submitting them by the given deadline...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/canon-singapore-will-be-hosting-the-photo-marathon-again-in-august-2015/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/canon-singapore-will-be-hosting-the-photo-marathon-again-in-august-2015/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5503): Restoration of the Carriage Position Sensor - Development of a New Beolover Part</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5503-restoration-of-the-carriage-position-sensor-development-of-a-new-beolover-part/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 May 2023 13:40:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5503-restoration-of-the-carriage-position-sensor-development-of-a-new-beolover-part/</guid><description>The Beogram 4002 (5503) being restored had a broken carriage position sensor photo resistor housing with damaged mounting tabs. After removing the housing and extracting the photo resistor, a replacement housing was designed and 3D printed.
The new housing consists of two parts. The photo resistor is placed on the insert part after straightening its leads. The main housing is then slid over the insert, sandwiching the photo resistor. This assembly is then inserted into the existing mounting cutouts and soldered to the PCB...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5503-restoration-of-the-carriage-position-sensor-development-of-a-new-beolover-part/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5503-restoration-of-the-carriage-position-sensor-development-of-a-new-beolover-part/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5501): Random Stop Issue Fixed - Defective Photo Resistor in the Spindle RPM Sensor</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5501-random-stop-issue-fixed-defective-photo-resistor-in-the-spindle-rpm-sensor/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jun 2022 05:32:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5501-random-stop-issue-fixed-defective-photo-resistor-in-the-spindle-rpm-sensor/</guid><description>A Beogram 4002 (5501) turntable, previously restored, began experiencing a problem where the OFF function would randomly activate during playback as if the button was pressed.
Prior to delving into the solution, the circuit diagram is presented for reference.
Transistor TR17, within the &amp;lsquo;Electronic Switch&amp;rsquo; section, is responsible for initiating the turntable&amp;rsquo;s OFF function. When its base is grounded, the collector rises to approximately 18V, causing the arm to lift and return to its resting position...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5501-random-stop-issue-fixed-defective-photo-resistor-in-the-spindle-rpm-sensor/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5501-random-stop-issue-fixed-defective-photo-resistor-in-the-spindle-rpm-sensor/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
