Over recent years, the European Court of Justice has issued several judgments invalidating parts of Spanish mortgage law, both in terms of its content and procedures, and how it’s interpreted by the courts. These rulings were based on the fact that these laws went against EU consumer protection regulations. In particular, the Court based its decisions on Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5 April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts.</description></item></channel></rss>
