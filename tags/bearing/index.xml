This particular motor uses brushes and has simple sleeve bearings.
To access the bearings for lubrication, the pulley and outer housing were removed. The pulley is attached to the shaft with glue, allowing for easy removal. After taking out two small screws, the housing can be opened and the motor taken out.
Next, the black rubber vibration insulation boot was removed, revealing the circuit board connected to the brushes.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): Infusing Oilite Brass Bearings of DC Motor with Oil Under Vacuum</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-infusing-oilite-brass-bearings-of-dc-motor-with-oil-under-vacuum/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 14:27:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-infusing-oilite-brass-bearings-of-dc-motor-with-oil-under-vacuum/</guid><description>Restoring the DC motors found in Beogram 4002/4 turntables (models 551x and 552x) presents a significant challenge. Many of these motors exhibit loud operation and inconsistent rotational speed due to their age. While lubricating the motor&amp;rsquo;s brass sleeve bearings with grease might seem like a solution, this often only yields temporary improvement.
The root of the issue lies in the use of &amp;lsquo;oilite&amp;rsquo; bearings, which are designed to operate without external lubrication.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): Replacing the Tracking Sensor Light Bulb with a Plug-In Ready SMD LED Assembly</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-replacing-the-tracking-sensor-light-bulb-with-a-plug-in-ready-smd-led-assembly/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Aug 2023 09:07:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-replacing-the-tracking-sensor-light-bulb-with-a-plug-in-ready-smd-led-assembly/</guid><description>During the restoration of my Beogram 4002 (5513), I installed the latest iteration of my SMD LED light source for the tracking sensor.
Previously, I designed a drop-in SMD LED assembly to replace the incandescent bulb fixture, which worked well. However, it still relied on the original, cumbersome tracking sensor sensitivity adjustment process. This process involves carefully positioning the light sensors relative to the light source, a task made difficult by the mechanism&amp;rsquo;s sensitivity and the adjustment mechanism&amp;rsquo;s coarseness.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5523): Adjustment of Platter and Sub-Chassis Alignment, Installation of New Transport Lock Bushings and Adjustment of the Tonearm</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5523-adjustment-of-platter-and-sub-chassis-alignment-installation-of-new-transport-lock-bushings-and-adjustment-of-the-tonearm/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Mar 2023 02:55:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5523-adjustment-of-platter-and-sub-chassis-alignment-installation-of-new-transport-lock-bushings-and-adjustment-of-the-tonearm/</guid><description>After restoring the mechanics and electronics of a Beogram 4002 (5523) turntable, it was time to ensure proper alignment of the platter, sub-chassis, and tonearm. The first step was centering the sub-chassis within the transport locks. However, a previous repair attempt had misaligned the transport locks, preventing adjustment. Taking the opportunity, new bushings were installed to replace the deteriorated originals, evidenced by orange plastic fragments within the enclosure.

The sleeve bearings were dry, causing a high-pitched sound when spinning without the load of the belt and platter. To restore peace to my workspace and enjoy some vinyl, I decided to fix this first.
The motor was removed from its mounting plate by unscrewing two screws and carefully prying off the glued pulley. After opening the outer enclosure, the motor was extracted.</description></item></channel></rss>
