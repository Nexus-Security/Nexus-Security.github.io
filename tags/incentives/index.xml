The Robert Half 2017 Salary Guide highlights that 69% of Singaporean employees are driven by more than just monetary compensation. The study reveals that nearly half (43%) would accept lower pay for flexible work hours, while over a third (37%) would choose the ability to work remotely over a pay raise.
Non-financial benefits are highly valued by Singaporean workers, with 28% willing to trade a portion of their salary for increased medical benefits and 20% favoring more vacation time.</description></item></channel></rss>
