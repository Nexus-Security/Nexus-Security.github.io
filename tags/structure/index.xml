The consultation document states that if directors wish to stay on after the limit, they must be reclassified as non-independent, even if their appointment was previously approved by a two-tier vote.
They are also seeking feedback on making it mandatory for companies to disclose the exact amount and breakdown of board directors&amp;rsquo; and the CEO&amp;rsquo;s pay in their annual report, identifying them by name.</description></item></channel></rss>
