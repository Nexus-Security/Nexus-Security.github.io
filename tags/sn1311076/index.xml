The first Beogram 4002 Type 5513, serial number 1312615, used a stack of concave washers to secure the floating suspension to the top plate. These washers were also present on the bottom lock.
The second Beogram 4002 Type 5513, serial number 1311076, features a slightly different suspension mechanism. This earlier production model employs a single, concave metal piece between the suspension lock and the top plate...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-floating-chassis/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-floating-chassis/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 Type 5513: Inside Work</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-inside-work/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2024 16:16:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-inside-work/</guid><description>My work on restoring a Beogram 4002 turntable from Houston continues, focusing on the internal components this time. This update covers the refurbishment of the tangential arm assembly and the replacement of the Beogram&amp;rsquo;s reservoir capacitor.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a current picture of the Beogram 4002 with its chassis and tangential arm assembly removed.
The tangential arm assembly components on this Beogram 4002 are in great condition.

The only remaining tasks are some enjoyable record-playing tests in my office. I find listening to records through a favorite system while working far more pleasurable than watching television&amp;hellip;and it&amp;rsquo;s a necessary job that someone has to do.
I&amp;rsquo;m truly happy with how this Beogram turned out. Knowing this turntable has been meticulously serviced is a great feeling. It&amp;rsquo;s spotless inside, and Beolover did an exceptional job revitalizing the platter motor...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-houston-beogram-3-ready-for-action-again/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-houston-beogram-3-ready-for-action-again/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 Type 5513: Reassembly of the Floating Chassis and Some Initial Checks</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-reassembly-of-the-floating-chassis-and-some-initial-checks/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Aug 2023 23:34:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-reassembly-of-the-floating-chassis-and-some-initial-checks/</guid><description>After completing the tangential arm assembly checks and cleaning the Beogram 4002 cabinet, it was time to reinstall the floating chassis.
The reassembly began with cleaning and lubricating the three suspension lock down screws, then reinstalling them in the Beogram cabinet.
With all three suspension locks back in place, the platter motor and output board, which had been previously restored, were reinstalled.
The control panel, RPM indicator panel, and arm position scale were then put back in their respective places...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-reassembly-of-the-floating-chassis-and-some-initial-checks/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-reassembly-of-the-floating-chassis-and-some-initial-checks/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 Type 5513: Service Manual Checks and Sensor Adjustment for the Third Beogram from Houston</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-service-manual-checks-and-sensor-adjustment-for-the-third-beogram-from-houston/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2023 10:37:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-service-manual-checks-and-sensor-adjustment-for-the-third-beogram-from-houston/</guid><description>The Beogram 4002 restoration is nearing completion, moving from the workbench to the test bench. The final phase involved service manual checks and adjustments, along with calibrating the record detection, arm position, and tracking sensors.
Following a guide, the record detection sensor was calibrated by adjusting the 1TR3 collector voltage to 4 VDC for an empty, spinning platter. This voltage should remain consistent with a record on the platter.
Next, the tangential arm position sensor was adjusted to achieve 5 VDC at the 4IC1 collector when illuminated by the sensor lamp through a transparent part of the position scale...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-service-manual-checks-and-sensor-adjustment-for-the-third-beogram-from-houston/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-service-manual-checks-and-sensor-adjustment-for-the-third-beogram-from-houston/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
