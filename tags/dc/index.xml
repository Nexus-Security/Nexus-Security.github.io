From a typical consumer perspective, with a lifespan of 10-15 years, these bearings might be considered &amp;ldquo;maintenance-free.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 DC Motor Restoration: Comparison of the RPM Stability Between Four Motors</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-dc-motor-restoration-comparison-of-the-rpm-stability-between-four-motors/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Dec 2022 22:52:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-dc-motor-restoration-comparison-of-the-rpm-stability-between-four-motors/</guid><description>Sonavor is currently restoring four Beogram 4002 turntables and recently asked for assistance in refurbishing the DC motors.
The restoration process involves removing the motor bearings, cleaning them, and applying fresh oil. To ensure effectiveness, a vacuum is used to draw the oil into the porous bearing material. The bearings are then cleaned of excess oil and reinstalled.
After reassembly, each motor undergoes a 24-hour RPM stability test using a specialized device.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5514): Rebuilding a Noisy DC Motor with Oil Infused Bearings</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5514-rebuilding-a-noisy-dc-motor-with-oil-infused-bearings/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Nov 2022 11:33:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5514-rebuilding-a-noisy-dc-motor-with-oil-infused-bearings/</guid><description>The majority of Beogram 4002 turntables equipped with a DC motor require motor refurbishment.
