The manual advises users to only enable the &amp;ldquo;Auto-Update SmartLists&amp;rdquo; option in a single company within Extender&amp;rsquo;s options.
This recommendation stems from the system-wide nature of SmartLists contrasting with the company-specific design of Extender windows. The suggested approach is to designate a &amp;ldquo;main&amp;rdquo; company where this option is enabled, perform all Extender configurations within that company, and then export and import the necessary windows to other companies as needed...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/were-you-aware-of-the-extender-setup-process/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/were-you-aware-of-the-extender-setup-process/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Choose blogs that start with [%] in the Smartlist.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/choose-blogs-that-start-with-in-the-smartlist/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Aug 2023 18:17:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/choose-blogs-that-start-with-in-the-smartlist/</guid><description>Last week, I encountered a simple but frustrating issue. I needed to find all payables transactions with a document number starting with a percent sign. The client used this to flag specific invoices for further processing.
I created a Payables Transaction SmartList in Microsoft Dynamics GP with the following criteria: Document Number begins with %, Vendor ID is &amp;lsquo;XYZ&amp;rsquo;, Document Amount is between $50 and $5,000, and Document Date is between 01/01/2023 and 01/31/2023...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/choose-blogs-that-start-with-in-the-smartlist/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/choose-blogs-that-start-with-in-the-smartlist/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Speeding up the SmartList Export to Excel process</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/speeding-up-the-smartlist-export-to-excel-process/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jul 2023 04:37:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/speeding-up-the-smartlist-export-to-excel-process/</guid><description>On his blog, Developing for Dynamics GP, Patrick Roth describes a useful, albeit undocumented and unsupported, method for speeding up SmartList exports to Excel. While this approach may lead to formatting issues, the significant performance gains likely outweigh the effort of manually reformatting in Excel.
This discussion reminded me of a past client who utilized GP 7.5 with Excel 2003 to export large datasets. Due to Excel 2003&amp;rsquo;s row limit of 65,536, I created a VB application that split the exported data into multiple CSV files, each below the row limit...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/speeding-up-the-smartlist-export-to-excel-process/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/speeding-up-the-smartlist-export-to-excel-process/</a></p></description></item><item><title>SmartList and Year End: A love affair.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/smartlist-and-year-end-a-love-affair/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Jan 2023 22:56:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/smartlist-and-year-end-a-love-affair/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of SmartList, especially with the added power of SmartList Builder. While we save that for later, let&amp;rsquo;s focus on basic SmartList uses for year-end tasks. I&amp;rsquo;m preparing a presentation on this and want to share some of my top SmartLists.
Here they are, in no specific order:
