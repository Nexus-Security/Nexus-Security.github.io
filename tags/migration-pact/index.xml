The analysis focuses on how the European Commission&amp;rsquo;s proposals within the Pact could affect the fundamental rights of stateless migrants and refugees. It offers suggestions for addressing these concerns during Pact negotiations and implementation.
The Pact, as it stands, fails to directly address the rights of stateless individuals or offer solutions to the specific protection issues they encounter.</description></item></channel></rss>
