Companies may desire individual domain names for each product line, and online marketers might create separate websites tailored to specific products or demographics. This then raises the question of how to host multiple domains effectively.

Basic web hosting, like HostGator&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Hatchling&amp;rdquo; plan, is affordable for individuals and small businesses with simple websites. These plans offer shared resources like disk space and bandwidth at a low cost.</description></item></channel></rss>
