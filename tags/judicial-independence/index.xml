Can the EU penalize its member states for consistently violating human rights and the rule of law? And if so, how?
This article, the second in a three-part series, explores this question. The first installment analyzed the official mechanism designed for this purpose: Article 7 TEU. As previously discussed, this process, which could result in the suspension of certain EU membership rights for a member state, is highly political, offers limited involvement from EU courts, and is challenging to implement.</description></item><item><title>Is Malta on the verge of a Van Gend moment for EU rule of law through its courts' judicial independence?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-malta-on-the-verge-of-a-van-gend-moment-for-eu-rule-of-law-through-its-courts-judicial-independence/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Aug 2023 16:37:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-malta-on-the-verge-of-a-van-gend-moment-for-eu-rule-of-law-through-its-courts-judicial-independence/</guid><description>Justin Borg-Barthet, Senior Lecturer in EU Law at the University of Aberdeen, writes:
Despite being an EU member for fifteen years, Maltese courts have been hesitant to refer legal interpretation questions to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). This could change with a case that has significant implications for the direct effect of EU member states&amp;rsquo; rule of law and human rights obligations. This legal challenge raises new and critical questions about democratizing EU constitutional law, similar to how the internal market law was democratized through the Van Gend case.</description></item><item><title>Challenges to Judicial Independence in the European Arrest Warrant System and Potential Solutions</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/challenges-to-judicial-independence-in-the-european-arrest-warrant-system-and-potential-solutions/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jul 2023 14:24:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/challenges-to-judicial-independence-in-the-european-arrest-warrant-system-and-potential-solutions/</guid><description>Dr Leandro Mancano, Senior Lecturer in EU Law, Edinburgh Law School

Introduction
The European Arrest Warrant Framework Decision (EAW FD) has significantly altered cooperation between EU states on criminal justice matters (for its effects beyond the EU, see the Court of Justice’s judgments in Petruhhin – discussed here – and IN).</description></item><item><title>Is Poland violating the principle of effective judicial protection?

While the Court of Justice plays a significant role in enforcing EU law through infringement and preliminary ruling procedures (Articles 258 and 267 TFEU, respectively), it has largely been excluded from enforcing EU values, particularly the rule of law. The EU Treaties lack explicit provisions granting the Court of Justice the power to address rule of law breaches by Member States.</description></item><item><title>Is this the start of the downfall of Poland's controversial "judicial reforms"?

These changes include lowering the retirement age for judges on the country&amp;rsquo;s highest court. This move has been presented by the government as a necessary reform to hold accountable judges who were supposedly involved in the country&amp;rsquo;s previous communist regime, even though that regime ended three decades ago.</description></item><item><title>Comments on the Polish ruling party's "fake judges" in Case C-824/18 AB and Case C-132/20 Getin Noble Bank before the European Court of Justice.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/comments-on-the-polish-ruling-party-s-fake-judges-in-case-c-824-18-ab-and-case-c-132-20-getin-noble-bank-before-the-european-court-of-justice/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Aug 2022 14:37:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/comments-on-the-polish-ruling-party-s-fake-judges-in-case-c-824-18-ab-and-case-c-132-20-getin-noble-bank-before-the-european-court-of-justice/</guid><description>Laurent Pech, Professor of Law, University of Middlesex On March 2, 2021, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) delivered its third judgment in a preliminary ruling case from a Polish court. This case pertained to the deterioration of the rule of law in Poland, an ongoing issue for over five years. Notably, there have been 35 requests for preliminary rulings from Polish courts compared to only three infringement actions brought by the Commission.</description></item></channel></rss>
