Technavio&amp;rsquo;s research shows that Botox holds the largest share of the facial aesthetics market, making up roughly 52% of the total. They attribute this dominance to changing cultural perceptions of beauty, higher disposable incomes, and the growing popularity of the brand.</description></item></channel></rss>
