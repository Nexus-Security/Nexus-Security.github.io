As the deadline for Brexit approaches and Theresa May&amp;rsquo;s conflicting negotiating goals become clearer, there are increasing demands for transparency regarding the Brexit process.
In late 2017, seven Scottish politicians from different parties and legislative bodies in Scotland (the Scottish Parliament, the UK Parliament, and the European Parliament) initiated a legal case in the Scottish Court of Session...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/putting-an-end-to-brexit-explaining-the-wightman-case-on-reversing-the-article-50-notification-independently/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/putting-an-end-to-brexit-explaining-the-wightman-case-on-reversing-the-article-50-notification-independently/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Brexit: You have the option to change your mind.

The recent definitive ruling by the Full Court concerning the Wightman case reaffirms the UK&amp;rsquo;s ability to independently revoke its withdrawal notification from the EU under the most flexible terms. This judgment aligns with the non-binding opinion given the previous week by an Advocate-General.

The Court dismissed the UK government&amp;rsquo;s claim of the case being hypothetical, emphasizing the imminent involvement of some litigants (who are MPs) in voting on the proposed withdrawal agreement...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/brexit-you-have-the-option-to-change-your-mind-the-cjeu-ruling-in-wightman-allows-for-a-u-turn/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/brexit-you-have-the-option-to-change-your-mind-the-cjeu-ruling-in-wightman-allows-for-a-u-turn/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Demonstrating the Efficacy of Health Interventions in Cases of Free Movement</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/demonstrating-the-efficacy-of-health-interventions-in-cases-of-free-movement/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jul 2023 08:18:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/demonstrating-the-efficacy-of-health-interventions-in-cases-of-free-movement/</guid><description>Angus MacCulloch, Lancaster University Law School
Two recent rulings concerning the free movement of goods (Articles 34/36 TFEU) highlight the critical importance of strong evidence when governments attempt to justify public health interventions in the market. The first example, a judgment from the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in Case C-148/15 Deutsche Parkinson Vereinigung, addressed the legality of fixed prices for prescription medicines in Germany. The second, a ruling from the Inner House of the Court of Session in Scotland in Scotch Whisky Assoc v LA [2016] CSIH 77, upheld the Scottish Government&amp;rsquo;s plan to introduce minimum unit pricing (MUP) for alcohol, finding it compatible with Article 34...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/demonstrating-the-efficacy-of-health-interventions-in-cases-of-free-movement/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/demonstrating-the-efficacy-of-health-interventions-in-cases-of-free-movement/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Paying tribute to Catalonia: The impact of EU law on movements for independence</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/paying-tribute-to-catalonia-the-impact-of-eu-law-on-movements-for-independence/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jul 2023 18:39:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/paying-tribute-to-catalonia-the-impact-of-eu-law-on-movements-for-independence/</guid><description>Steve Peers
The recent surge in support for pro-independence parties in Catalonia has revived discussions about the connection between EU law and independence movements within member states. This issue was previously discussed in the context of the Scottish independence referendum, but it&amp;rsquo;s worth revisiting now. There are three interconnected questions: Firstly, what happens if a region within a member state declares independence unilaterally, a potential scenario in Catalonia? Secondly, if a newly independent state, formerly part of an EU member, seeks continued EU membership, what are the implications?..<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/paying-tribute-to-catalonia-the-impact-of-eu-law-on-movements-for-independence/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/paying-tribute-to-catalonia-the-impact-of-eu-law-on-movements-for-independence/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The case of Scotch Whisky Association v Lord Advocate [2017] UKSC 76 demonstrates the appropriateness and necessity of implementing minimum alcohol pricing.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-case-of-scotch-whisky-association-v-lord-advocate-2017-uksc-76-demonstrates-the-appropriateness-and-necessity-of-implementing-minimum-alcohol-pricing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jun 2023 20:36:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-case-of-scotch-whisky-association-v-lord-advocate-2017-uksc-76-demonstrates-the-appropriateness-and-necessity-of-implementing-minimum-alcohol-pricing/</guid><description>Angus MacCulloch, Law School, Lancaster University (@AngusMacCulloch)
The UK Supreme Court, in a long-awaited decision on SWA v Lord Advocate, dismissed the Scotch Whisky Association&amp;rsquo;s (SWA) appeal, allowing the Scottish Government to proceed with its Minimum Unit Pricing (MUP) policy on alcohol sales. This policy, setting a minimum price of Â£0.50 per unit of alcohol under the 2012 Alcohol (Minimum Pricing)(Scotland) Act, faced a five-year delay due to legal challenges arguing its conflict with EU law...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-case-of-scotch-whisky-association-v-lord-advocate-2017-uksc-76-demonstrates-the-appropriateness-and-necessity-of-implementing-minimum-alcohol-pricing/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-case-of-scotch-whisky-association-v-lord-advocate-2017-uksc-76-demonstrates-the-appropriateness-and-necessity-of-implementing-minimum-alcohol-pricing/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Potential Reconstruction of Hadrian's Wall: How Scottish Independence Could Impact British Border Security</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/potential-reconstruction-of-hadrian-s-wall-how-scottish-independence-could-impact-british-border-security/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 May 2023 11:13:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/potential-reconstruction-of-hadrian-s-wall-how-scottish-independence-could-impact-british-border-security/</guid><description>Steve Peers
Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s Wall is often thought to have been built by the Romans to defend civilized Britannia from invading Picts, who are considered the ancestors of modern-day Scots. This idea is echoed in Game of Thrones, where the Wall serves to keep out wild and dangerous beings from the North.
Theresa May, the British Home Secretary, recently invoked this imagery when she suggested that if Scotland were to become independent, border control would need to be reinstated between Scotland and the remaining United Kingdom...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/potential-reconstruction-of-hadrian-s-wall-how-scottish-independence-could-impact-british-border-security/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/potential-reconstruction-of-hadrian-s-wall-how-scottish-independence-could-impact-british-border-security/</a></p></description></item><item><title>What would be the effect on the UK's relations with the EU if Scotland gained independence?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-would-be-the-effect-on-the-uk-s-relations-with-the-eu-if-scotland-gained-independence/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Feb 2023 00:31:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-would-be-the-effect-on-the-uk-s-relations-with-the-eu-if-scotland-gained-independence/</guid><description>Steve Peers
As the Scottish independence referendum approaches, with the &amp;ldquo;Yes&amp;rdquo; campaign gaining momentum and even leading some polls, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to analyze the potential impact of Scottish independence on the European Union (EU). This analysis will focus on the EU membership of both an independent Scotland and the remaining UK (rUK).
Scottish independence would trigger four significant, near-simultaneous events: negotiations between Scotland and rUK about their future relationship; negotiations for Scotland to rejoin the EU; renegotiation of the UK&amp;rsquo;s EU membership; and a UK general election...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-would-be-the-effect-on-the-uk-s-relations-with-the-eu-if-scotland-gained-independence/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-would-be-the-effect-on-the-uk-s-relations-with-the-eu-if-scotland-gained-independence/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Is the notice to withdraw from the EU being revoked?

Introduction
Is initiating the Article 50 withdrawal process from the EU irreversible, like jumping off a cliff? Or is it more like going shopping, where you can change your mind along the way, in the parking lot, or even inside the store? Perhaps this change of heart might be due to discovering the promised sale doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist, the management is under investigation, and the supposed extensive international food section is just a couple of dusty packages...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-notice-to-withdraw-from-the-eu-being-revoked-wightman-s-opinion-suggests-so/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-notice-to-withdraw-from-the-eu-being-revoked-wightman-s-opinion-suggests-so/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Balancing Health and Trade: The Scotch Whisky Association ruling on finding the right equilibrium.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/balancing-health-and-trade-the-scotch-whisky-association-ruling-on-finding-the-right-equilibrium/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Feb 2023 03:15:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/balancing-health-and-trade-the-scotch-whisky-association-ruling-on-finding-the-right-equilibrium/</guid><description>Angus MacCulloch, Lancaster University Law School The Court of Justice has issued its judgment regarding the legality of Scotland&amp;rsquo;s minimum alcohol pricing (MUP) measure in Case C-333/14.

During the Scottish National Party (SNP) conference, Scotland&amp;rsquo;s First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, revealed the Scottish Government&amp;rsquo;s plan to present a draft bill for a second independence referendum. She also announced their intention to introduce an alternate plan ensuring Scotland&amp;rsquo;s continued participation in the EU single market, even if the rest of the UK chooses to leave. This proposal would involve granting the Scottish Parliament substantial new powers, encompassing all current EU-related powers held by Scotland and additional authority to negotiate international treaties and manage immigration...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/scotland-and-brexit-courageous-heart-or-fearful-creature/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/scotland-and-brexit-courageous-heart-or-fearful-creature/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Can devolved powers help mitigate the negative effects of Brexit on Scotland?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/can-devolved-powers-help-mitigate-the-negative-effects-of-brexit-on-scotland/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Dec 2022 07:18:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/can-devolved-powers-help-mitigate-the-negative-effects-of-brexit-on-scotland/</guid><description>Alan S.

The UK&amp;rsquo;s devolution process, implemented with the understanding of continued EU membership, granted legislative and executive autonomy to Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland through specific Acts of Parliament.

Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon recently revealed the Scottish Government&amp;rsquo;s desire to pursue a second independence referendum. This announcement follows the UK government&amp;rsquo;s dismissal of Scotland&amp;rsquo;s proposed Brexit alternatives. The timing of this potential referendum, contingent on the UK&amp;rsquo;s final Brexit arrangements, brings Scotland&amp;rsquo;s EU membership into focus.

The Scottish government recently released its anticipated paper exploring Scotland&amp;rsquo;s position within Europe. While acknowledging the government&amp;rsquo;s support for both EU membership and Scottish independence, the paper concentrates on potential outcomes should Brexit occur while Scotland remains part of the UK. Accusations that the paper dismisses referendum results, regarding either Brexit or Scottish independence, or simply rehashes arguments for independence are unfounded.
The paper essentially presents two main options: a UK-wide approach to Brexit that considers the concerns of Scottish voters, or, if that fails, a separate approach specifically for Scotland...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/opinions-on-scotland-s-position-in-europe-analysis-of-the-scottish-government-s-latest-suggestions/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/opinions-on-scotland-s-position-in-europe-analysis-of-the-scottish-government-s-latest-suggestions/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Miller's ruling: Representative Democracy Makes a Comeback</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/miller-s-ruling-representative-democracy-makes-a-comeback/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Sep 2022 12:44:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/miller-s-ruling-representative-democracy-makes-a-comeback/</guid><description>Professor Steve Peers
