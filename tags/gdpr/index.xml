The UK&amp;rsquo;s exit from the European Union (EU) did not affect its participation in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). However, the relationship between human rights and EU law has changed for the UK. This blog post will explore the new connections between human rights and the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) now in effect between the EU and the UK.</description></item><item><title>Could Data Protection be Returning Home?

Imagine you&amp;rsquo;re showering when the doorbell unexpectedly interrupts. Hoping it&amp;rsquo;s the anticipated Amazon delivery with a birthday gift for your daughter, you rush downstairs, only to find a pair of Jehovah&amp;rsquo;s Witnesses.
After dismissing their pleas, you close the door, putting the encounter out of your mind. However, they haven&amp;rsquo;t forgotten you. To maintain their focus on potential converts, they keep records of visited homes, categorizing residents as &amp;ldquo;Believer,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Unbeliever,&amp;rdquo; or perhaps even &amp;ldquo;Satanist,&amp;rdquo; depending on your towel situation.</description></item><item><title>The impact of GDPR will be remembered in 2018</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-impact-of-gdpr-will-be-remembered-in-2018/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Nov 2023 06:43:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-impact-of-gdpr-will-be-remembered-in-2018/</guid><description>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) heavily influenced how we addressed online privacy in 2018.

This broad scope has shifted GDPR from a regional concern to a worldwide one.
Several industry leaders have shared their perspectives on GDPR&amp;rsquo;s significant effects:

The European Court of Justice (ECJ) recently issued its highly anticipated decision regarding the legitimacy of standard contractual clauses (SCCs) for transferring personal data outside the European Union. This decision is part of a larger effort to challenge the “surveillance capitalism” model employed by many online businesses. While this case significantly impacts SCCs and Facebook&amp;rsquo;s operations, it also reveals the ECJ&amp;rsquo;s stance against mass surveillance, a recurring theme in European jurisprudence.</description></item><item><title>The Data Protection Bill and UK-EU Data Transfers: A Story of Brexit and Data Protection</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-data-protection-bill-and-uk-eu-data-transfers-a-story-of-brexit-and-data-protection/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Oct 2023 13:07:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-data-protection-bill-and-uk-eu-data-transfers-a-story-of-brexit-and-data-protection/</guid><description>Elif Mendos Kuşkonmaz, PhD student at Queen Mary, University of London[*]
Introduction
A Bosnian folk song tells the story of a Pasha who died from a severe illness. When his wife heard about his passing, she died from grief. Similarly, now that the UK has chosen to leave the European Union, will the same fate befall data protection laws once the UK exits the EU?
The UK&amp;rsquo;s current data protection law, the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA), incorporates the EU&amp;rsquo;s 1995 Data Protection Directive.</description></item><item><title>The impact of Unabhängiges Landeszentrum für Datenschutz Schleswig-Holstein v.

Case Summary
The Wirtschaftsakademie, a business using a Facebook fanpage, was ordered by the Unabhängiges Landeszentrum für Datenschutz Schleswig-Holstein (ULD), a German data protection authority, to deactivate their page. The ULD argued that the page failed to warn visitors about potential data collection by Facebook through cookies.
This case highlights the benefits and data implications associated with Facebook fanpages. Page administrators benefit from free, anonymous user statistics through &amp;ldquo;Facebook Insights,&amp;rdquo; while Facebook gathers data for targeted advertising.</description></item><item><title>The GDPR's right to erasure (also known as the right to be forgotten) - a potential risk of "rewriting history" or an opportunity for individuals to move on from the past.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-gdpr-s-right-to-erasure-also-known-as-the-right-to-be-forgotten-a-potential-risk-of-rewriting-history-or-an-opportunity-for-individuals-to-move-on-from-the-past/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jun 2023 06:23:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-gdpr-s-right-to-erasure-also-known-as-the-right-to-be-forgotten-a-potential-risk-of-rewriting-history-or-an-opportunity-for-individuals-to-move-on-from-the-past/</guid><description>Ketevan Kukava, PhD Student in Law, Tbilisi State University
In today&amp;rsquo;s digital world, where information is readily stored and accessed, managing one&amp;rsquo;s personal data is a complex challenge. Completely removing data from digital platforms, especially once it&amp;rsquo;s publicly accessible, is technologically and practically difficult. The lasting impact of past actions, preserved online indefinitely, raises concerns in the present.
The internet and digitization, while offering unparalleled access to information and content creation tools, present a significant drawback: the loss of control over personal data and the right to be forgotten.</description></item><item><title>The Court of Justice of the European Union makes decisions regarding consent for cookies in accordance with data protection laws.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-court-of-justice-of-the-european-union-makes-decisions-regarding-consent-for-cookies-in-accordance-with-data-protection-laws/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 May 2023 19:09:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-court-of-justice-of-the-european-union-makes-decisions-regarding-consent-for-cookies-in-accordance-with-data-protection-laws/</guid><description>Lorna Woods, Professor of Internet Law, University of Essex

Introduction
In late 2016, the European Commission introduced the “Clean Energy for All Europeans” legislative package to modernize Europe&amp;rsquo;s electricity market and encourage cleaner energy solutions. This push for &amp;ldquo;decentralization&amp;rdquo; is seen as a way to drive innovation and shift the focus to a demand-driven energy policy. The goal is to give consumers the tools they need to actively participate in this change.</description></item><item><title>The CJEU interprets the e-commerce Directive regarding Facebook's responsibility for defamatory posts.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-interprets-the-e-commerce-directive-regarding-facebook-s-responsibility-for-defamatory-posts/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Sep 2022 08:57:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-interprets-the-e-commerce-directive-regarding-facebook-s-responsibility-for-defamatory-posts/</guid><description>Over the past few weeks, several legal decisions have addressed how individuals can control their information online.

Background
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Law Enforcement Directive (LED) have strict rules about transferring personal data outside the EU. Adequacy decisions are the simplest way to ensure these transfers are safe. Currently, twelve countries have received full or partial adequacy decisions, including Japan, which has additional safeguards in place. The US previously held an adequacy status, but the Court of Justice overturned this in the Schrems II case.</description></item><item><title>European Data Protection Authorities should reconsider their approach to Facial Recognition Technology in schools due to power imbalances and issues of consent.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/european-data-protection-authorities-should-reconsider-their-approach-to-facial-recognition-technology-in-schools-due-to-power-imbalances-and-issues-of-consent/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jul 2022 01:45:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/european-data-protection-authorities-should-reconsider-their-approach-to-facial-recognition-technology-in-schools-due-to-power-imbalances-and-issues-of-consent/</guid><description>Dr. Asress Adimi Gikay, a lecturer specializing in AI, Disruptive Innovation, and Law at Brunel Law School, Brunel University London, focuses his research on Artificial Intelligence, Law, and Policy.

Introduction
In June 2021, during the review of the eIDAS Regulation, the European Commission put forth a proposal to create a European Digital Identity framework. This framework would include a &amp;ldquo;European Digital Identity Wallet,&amp;rdquo; or EUDI Wallet. Seen as a major element of this proposal, the Wallet aims to address the increasing use of digital services across borders, both public and private.</description></item><item><title>Consumer law and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): Case C-319/20 involving Facebook Ireland - Advocate General's opinion</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/consumer-law-and-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr-case-c-319-20-involving-facebook-ireland-advocate-general-s-opinion/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Jul 2022 05:30:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/consumer-law-and-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr-case-c-319-20-involving-facebook-ireland-advocate-general-s-opinion/</guid><description>Lorna Woods, Professor of Internet Law, University of Essex
Facts
The Federation of German Consumer Organisations initiated legal proceedings in German courts against Facebook. They claimed that Facebook violated data protection rules by failing to provide sufficient information about data collection practices related to free, third-party games offered on its platform. The Federation argued that this also infringed upon unfair competition and consumer protection regulations. The case reached the Bundesgerischtshof, which raised concerns about the Federation&amp;rsquo;s legal standing to bring the action following the implementation of the GDPR.</description></item><item><title>Overview of the European Democracy Action Plan</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/overview-of-the-european-democracy-action-plan/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Jul 2022 04:55:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/overview-of-the-european-democracy-action-plan/</guid><description>Professor Lorna Woods, University of Essex
The European Democracy Action Plan (EDAP) is one piece of a larger effort to regulate the online world. Unveiled as a key initiative by Commission President von der Leyen, it joins upcoming legislation like the Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA). These measures signal a change in how the EU approaches internet regulation and raise questions about the EU&amp;rsquo;s authority in this space.</description></item><item><title>The Attorney General's opinion in the Schrems II case: Facebook, national security, and laws on data protection.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-attorney-general-s-opinion-in-the-schrems-ii-case-facebook-national-security-and-laws-on-data-protection/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Jul 2022 05:02:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-attorney-general-s-opinion-in-the-schrems-ii-case-facebook-national-security-and-laws-on-data-protection/</guid><description>Lorna Woods, Professor of Internet Law, University of Essex
Recently, a CJEU Advocate-General presented an opinion on the Schrems II case, which centers on the legality of US national security regulations regarding personal data transfers from the EU, specifically through Facebook. This case follows the impactful Schrems I ruling that invalidated the EU-US data transfer agreement due to insufficient protections against surveillance under US law. While companies shifted to alternative mechanisms, like Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), Schrems II (Data Protection Commissioner v.</description></item></channel></rss>
