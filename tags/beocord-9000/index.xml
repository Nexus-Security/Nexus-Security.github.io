This chip is responsible for storing calibration data and potentially the system time, although further investigation is required. A visual representation of the circuit is included below.
A positive aspect of the design is the inclusion of diode D27, which safeguards the battery against reverse polarity connection.</description></item><item><title>Beocord 9000: Replacing Capacitors</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-replacing-capacitors/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Mar 2024 19:30:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-replacing-capacitors/</guid><description>With 2017 underway and the festivities behind us, it&amp;rsquo;s time to resume the Beocord 9000 restoration. I began by replacing the electrolytic capacitors. As I&amp;rsquo;ve noted before, these Beocord 9000 units often require minimal recapping, if any. This particular unit seems to have been stored for a considerable period, and I already discovered one faulty capacitor, prompting me to replace the others.
My usual practice is to use audio-grade capacitors in the signal path and opt for high-reliability, 105Â°C rated, long-lasting capacitors elsewhere.</description></item><item><title>Beocord 9000: Power Supply</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-power-supply/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Mar 2024 11:40:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-power-supply/</guid><description>I began troubleshooting the Beocord&amp;rsquo;s electrical issues by examining the power supply. The power supply wasn&amp;rsquo;t functioning correctly, and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t getting +24 VDC at capacitor C1. Initially, I suspected the rectifier board, so I removed it to inspect the supply capacitors (C1, C2, and C3).
Here are the readings for capacitors C1 through C3.
To further diagnose the problem, I swapped components from other Beocord 9000 units I had available.</description></item><item><title>Beocord 9000: Restoration of the Peak Program Meter with SMD LEDs (I)</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-restoration-of-the-peak-program-meter-with-smd-leds-i-/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Nov 2023 04:08:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-restoration-of-the-peak-program-meter-with-smd-leds-i-/</guid><description>While I&amp;rsquo;m waiting for a part for a Beocord 9000 cassette deck, I&amp;rsquo;ve started restoring another one with faulty displays. It seems cassettes are making a comeback! I&amp;rsquo;m even hoping for new tapes and maybe even a revival of the Sony Walkman II.
This particular Beocord 9000 has a very dim display:

The &amp;ldquo;Time Cal&amp;rdquo; bulb is also weak, a common issue. I began with the VU meter (or Peak Program Meter), as I haven&amp;rsquo;t refurbished this type before.</description></item><item><title>Beocord 9000: Finishing Up The Tape Transport</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-finishing-up-the-tape-transport/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2023 17:26:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-finishing-up-the-tape-transport/</guid><description>The Beocord 9000 tape transport is now fixed and reassembled. Cleaning and lubrication were done on all moving parts, including the thrust roller assembly, even though it wasn&amp;rsquo;t being replaced.
The reassembly process involved reinstalling several components, starting with the take-up and supply reel assembly.
Next, the clutch, interconnecting mechanics, flywheel, belts, cassette holder, and opening damper assembly were put back in place.
To test the restored transport before installing it in the Beocord 9000, it was temporarily swapped into a different Beocord 9000.</description></item><item><title>Beocord 9000: Restoration of the Peak Program Meter with SMD LEDs (III)</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-restoration-of-the-peak-program-meter-with-smd-leds-iii-/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Oct 2023 23:15:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-restoration-of-the-peak-program-meter-with-smd-leds-iii-/</guid><description>This article, the third in a series about restoring a Beocord 9000&amp;rsquo;s peak program meters (PPM), focuses on installing and calibrating the rebuilt PPM.
The initial step involved switching the original current limiting resistors with values suitable for modern SMD LEDs. These LEDs are more efficient and brighter, requiring significantly larger resistors to match the original brightness. Testing showed that 470 Ohm and 330 Ohm resistors for red and green LEDs, respectively, produced slightly brighter output compared to the original 180 Ohm and 120 Ohm resistors.</description></item><item><title>Beocord 9000: Repair of a Broken Out Leaf Spring in the Tape Mechanism</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-repair-of-a-broken-out-leaf-spring-in-the-tape-mechanism/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Oct 2023 20:41:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-repair-of-a-broken-out-leaf-spring-in-the-tape-mechanism/</guid><description>During the restoration of a Beocord 9000, a loose part was discovered within the device&amp;rsquo;s casing. This component turned out to be the left leaf spring responsible for securing the head carrier. A comparison with the corresponding right spring revealed that a small ball bearing, crucial for smooth head movement, was missing.
Further investigation determined the ball bearing&amp;rsquo;s diameter to be 2.5 mm, and a readily available supply was procured. The broken plastic piece attached to the loose spring indicated that the original assembly, constantly under tension, had given way.</description></item><item><title>Beocord 9000: Opening It Up</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-opening-it-up/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 11:49:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-opening-it-up/</guid><description>Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen audio devices from the early 1980s are great to repair because their components are easily accessible for service and inspection.
One of the first things to examine on Beocord 8000 through 9000 series cassette decks is the tape transport mechanism. While replacing the belts is part of regular maintenance, there are other mechanical aspects to address.
Upon opening this Beocord 9000, I immediately noticed a small broken part.</description></item><item><title>Beocord 9000: Replacing the Incandescent Indicator Light Bulbs with SMD LEDs</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-replacing-the-incandescent-indicator-light-bulbs-with-smd-leds/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Oct 2023 13:48:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-replacing-the-incandescent-indicator-light-bulbs-with-smd-leds/</guid><description>During the restoration of a Beocord 9000, two indicator lights presented problems. One had a typical issue with a broken lead, while the other had become dim due to a deteriorating filament.
To address this, I opted to use SMD LEDs as replacements, similar to a method I&amp;rsquo;ve used for Beomaster 8000 units, documented on my blog. This provides lasting stability and safeguards against potential shipping damage. However, the Beocord 9000 has more compact reflector housings compared to the Beomaster 8000, necessitating a redesign of the PCBs for the LEDs.</description></item><item><title>Beocord 9000: Total Recap - Replacement of all Electrolytic Capacitors</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-total-recap-replacement-of-all-electrolytic-capacitors/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Oct 2023 10:32:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-total-recap-replacement-of-all-electrolytic-capacitors/</guid><description>This article revisits a complete restoration of a Beocord 9000 cassette deck, focusing on the replacement of electrolytic capacitors for improved long-term reliability. While not as crucial as with amplifiers due to lower operating temperatures, capacitor replacement is recommended for optimal performance.
The Beocord 9000, designed for serviceability, allows access to its numerous electrolytic capacitors. Unlike its predecessors, it offers easier access by removing the front and back panels instead of extracting the main circuit boards.</description></item><item><title>Beocord 9000: Restoration of the Peak Program Meter Scale Illumination</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-restoration-of-the-peak-program-meter-scale-illumination/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Oct 2023 08:25:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-restoration-of-the-peak-program-meter-scale-illumination/</guid><description>Even though the scale illumination light bulb was functioning in the Beocord 9000 display, my customer opted for a replacement to avoid any potential issues during shipping. This makes sense because these bulbs are fragile and prone to breaking, especially with rough handling. I prefer to replace all bulbs to prevent future problems.
I performed this procedure before on a Beocord 9000 with a broken bulb, as documented on my blog.</description></item><item><title>Beocord 9000: The Tape Transport</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-the-tape-transport/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Sep 2023 10:13:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-the-tape-transport/</guid><description>After cleaning the belt residue, the tape transport needs to be removed for disassembly. Three screws and four connectors need to be detached to free the tape transport. The image shows the Beocord tape transport ready for restoration.

This decision stemmed from my success in restoring a different Beocord&amp;rsquo;s PPM that had several broken segments.
Since the technology behind these PPMs is similar to that of a 7-segment display, I realized that the segments in this unit were also susceptible to future breakage. Therefore, I chose to preemptively address the issue while I had the opportunity.</description></item><item><title>Beocord 9000: Exchanging the Rubber Parts in the Tape Mechanism</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-exchanging-the-rubber-parts-in-the-tape-mechanism/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2023 13:15:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-exchanging-the-rubber-parts-in-the-tape-mechanism/</guid><description>My Beocord 9000 restoration project saw some good progress. I recently installed new rubber tires on the idler wheels of the tape drive mechanism to address a rewinding issue. The deck wasn&amp;rsquo;t rewinding smoothly, becoming very slow and sometimes even stopping at the end of the process. This seemed like a common problem attributed to hardened idler wheel rubber, as suggested by Beoworld.org.
However, upon disassembling the mechanism, I discovered that a previous repair attempt had damaged a crucial friction pad, which was the root cause of the problem.</description></item><item><title>Beocord 9000: Repair of a Broken Out DIN-7 Jack With 3D Printed Inserts</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-repair-of-a-broken-out-din-7-jack-with-3d-printed-inserts/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jul 2023 18:32:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-repair-of-a-broken-out-din-7-jack-with-3d-printed-inserts/</guid><description>Repairing the broken DIN 7 jack on the Beocord 9000 was simpler than anticipated. The part is identical to the one used for the Beomaster 8000&amp;rsquo;s Phono input. A 3D printed part, designed previously, was used to replace the fragile tabs on these sockets, which often break and cause the jack to fall into the panel cutout.

With the regulator board cleared, I shifted focus to the power supply board&amp;rsquo;s voltages.</description></item><item><title>Beocord 9000: Ready for Bench Testing</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-ready-for-bench-testing/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Feb 2023 17:45:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-ready-for-bench-testing/</guid><description>Over the weekend, I finished the seven-segment display repair. The LEDs performed without issue during a 24-hour burn-in test. I double-checked the LEDs after reassembling the display using my specialized test equipment. My test setup has two parts for evaluating the Beocord display. The left side tests all LEDs illuminated simultaneously, while the right side allows me to test each LED channel or individual LED by adjusting jumpers.
During individual LED testing, I observed some light bleed from the middle &amp;ldquo;dot&amp;rdquo; LEDs into the neighboring segments.</description></item><item><title>Beocord 9000: Seven Segment Display Board Reworked</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-seven-segment-display-board-reworked/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2022 23:50:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-seven-segment-display-board-reworked/</guid><description>Setting up the Beosystem display board rework station took a bit longer than anticipated, but it&amp;rsquo;s finally ready for LED display repairs and testing.
