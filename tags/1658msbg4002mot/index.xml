Initial testing showed the motor was barely functional. To address this, the motor was disassembled, and the bearings were removed for lubrication.
The bearings, designed to be porous and oil-filled, were treated with a vacuum oil infusion process. This process, evidenced by vigorous bubbling, helps to replenish the oil within the bearings over time. After a few days, the bubbling subsided, indicating the bearings were adequately filled with oil, and they were removed from the oil bath.</description></item></channel></rss>
