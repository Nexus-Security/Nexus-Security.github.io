Traditionally, broadcasting and newspapers have been regulated differently. Newspapers have enjoyed more lenient, often self-regulatory, oversight. EU law harmonized television broadcasting through the Television without Frontiers Directive. Newspapers, if subject to EU law, fell under general free movement and competition rules. As technology evolved and online information services emerged, the Television without Frontiers Directive underwent revisions, becoming the Audiovisual Media Services Directive.</description></item><item><title>The European Commission introduces an anti-SLAPP initiative known as 'Daphne's Law'.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-european-commission-introduces-an-anti-slapp-initiative-known-as-daphne-s-law/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Apr 2023 02:25:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-european-commission-introduces-an-anti-slapp-initiative-known-as-daphne-s-law/</guid><description>Professor Justin Borg-Barthet, University of Aberdeen*

A recent case before the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) raises the question of whether internet site providers should be held accountable for comments made by users. This issue gained significance following the court&amp;rsquo;s ruling in MTE v. Hungary.
Considering the importance of intermediaries in the internet&amp;rsquo;s growth, there are arguments for not treating them like traditional publishers. Instead, they could be granted some immunity regarding content posted by others.</description></item><item><title>Overview of the European Democracy Action Plan</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/overview-of-the-european-democracy-action-plan/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Jul 2022 04:55:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/overview-of-the-european-democracy-action-plan/</guid><description>Professor Lorna Woods, University of Essex
