A 2002 study discovered that dates may be effective in combating cancer-causing mutations. In a 2009 study, healthy individuals who consumed 100g of dates daily for four weeks showed remarkable results.
Despite the sugar content of the Hallawi and Medjool dates, their blood sugar levels remained stable. The research also indicated that dates could potentially inhibit plaque buildup in arteries.</description></item></channel></rss>
