The Danish Supreme Court recently issued its judgment in the Ajos case, concerning the scope of the EU employment equality Directive and age discrimination. This decision follows a ruling from the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) that provided two paths for the Danish court: interpret national law in harmony with the Directive or disapply conflicting national provisions...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-there-a-conflict-or-disagreement-between-the-european-court-of-justice-and-the-danish-constitutional-court-the-danish-supreme-court-is-questioning-the-mangold-principle/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-there-a-conflict-or-disagreement-between-the-european-court-of-justice-and-the-danish-constitutional-court-the-danish-supreme-court-is-questioning-the-mangold-principle/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The request for a preliminary ruling from the Polish Supreme Court on 2 August 2018 and its implications for the rule of law in Poland: A commentary on the CJEU's involvement.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-request-for-a-preliminary-ruling-from-the-polish-supreme-court-on-2-august-2018-and-its-implications-for-the-rule-of-law-in-poland-a-commentary-on-the-cjeu-s-involvement/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2024 23:00:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-request-for-a-preliminary-ruling-from-the-polish-supreme-court-on-2-august-2018-and-its-implications-for-the-rule-of-law-in-poland-a-commentary-on-the-cjeu-s-involvement/</guid><description>Alicja Sikora, Chair EU Law, Jagiellonian University
As the playwright Eugene Ionesco once said, predictions are only possible after events have occurred.
Last Thursday, the Polish Supreme Court presented the European Court of Justice with a request for a preliminary ruling. This type of request, outlined in Article 267 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, is used to clarify questions regarding EU law. In doing so, the Polish court also paused the enforcement of a Polish law mandating early retirement for Supreme Court justices over 65...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-request-for-a-preliminary-ruling-from-the-polish-supreme-court-on-2-august-2018-and-its-implications-for-the-rule-of-law-in-poland-a-commentary-on-the-cjeu-s-involvement/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-request-for-a-preliminary-ruling-from-the-polish-supreme-court-on-2-august-2018-and-its-implications-for-the-rule-of-law-in-poland-a-commentary-on-the-cjeu-s-involvement/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The CJEU clarifies CILFIT regarding the final courts' obligations to refer questions.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-clarifies-cilfit-regarding-the-final-courts-obligations-to-refer-questions/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jan 2024 19:34:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-clarifies-cilfit-regarding-the-final-courts-obligations-to-refer-questions/</guid><description>Daniel Sarmiento, Professor of EU Law at the University Complutense of Madrid*
In a previous post, I argued that the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) held national supreme courts to a higher standard than the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) regarding preliminary references to the CJEU. I suggested this was due to the CJEU&amp;rsquo;s ruling in the CILFIT case. However, the CJEU has recently proven me wrong...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-clarifies-cilfit-regarding-the-final-courts-obligations-to-refer-questions/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-clarifies-cilfit-regarding-the-final-courts-obligations-to-refer-questions/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Close partners: The highest courts of member states and the enforcement of EU legislation</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/close-partners-the-highest-courts-of-member-states-and-the-enforcement-of-eu-legislation/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Dec 2022 11:28:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/close-partners-the-highest-courts-of-member-states-and-the-enforcement-of-eu-legislation/</guid><description>Daniel Sarmiento, Professor of EU Law at the University Complutense of Madrid*
Two high courts in France and Spain recently issued significant rulings concerning how lawyers and domestic courts should apply EU law. Although dealing with distinct issues, both decisions are important for properly implementing EU law. As noted a few weeks prior, national high courts are becoming crucial in EU law, a trend the Court of Justice should encourage...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/close-partners-the-highest-courts-of-member-states-and-the-enforcement-of-eu-legislation/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/close-partners-the-highest-courts-of-member-states-and-the-enforcement-of-eu-legislation/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Is this the start of the downfall of Poland's controversial "judicial reforms"?

These changes include lowering the retirement age for judges on the country&amp;rsquo;s highest court. This move has been presented by the government as a necessary reform to hold accountable judges who were supposedly involved in the country&amp;rsquo;s previous communist regime, even though that regime ended three decades ago...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-this-the-start-of-the-downfall-of-poland-s-controversial-judicial-reforms-reflections-on-the-recent-ecj-decision-in-commission-v-poland-regarding-the-independence-of-the-supreme-court/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-this-the-start-of-the-downfall-of-poland-s-controversial-judicial-reforms-reflections-on-the-recent-ecj-decision-in-commission-v-poland-regarding-the-independence-of-the-supreme-court/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
