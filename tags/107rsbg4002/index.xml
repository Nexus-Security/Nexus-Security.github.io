It&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to replace these old connectors with new, gold-plated ones. This specific Beogram 4002 (5513) came with RCA connectors.
I typically use large, modern, high-quality metal plugs for replacements. However, this project had a unique requirement: the Beogram needed to connect to a Beolab 5000. The Beolab 5000 has a compact compartment for its connectors, which creates limitations on plug size...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-new-gold-plated-rca-plugs/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-new-gold-plated-rca-plugs/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): Replacing the RPM Scales Light Bulbs with LEDs and a Further Improvement of the RPM Stability</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-replacing-the-rpm-scales-light-bulbs-with-leds-and-a-further-improvement-of-the-rpm-stability/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Mar 2024 00:05:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-replacing-the-rpm-scales-light-bulbs-with-leds-and-a-further-improvement-of-the-rpm-stability/</guid><description>During the restoration of a Beogram 4002 (5513), SMD LEDs were used to replace the incandescent bulbs that illuminate the RPM trimmer scales on the control panel.

The turntable was packaged well and arrived in excellent cosmetic condition with only minor blemishes.
The keypad appears barely used. However, the hood has some deep scratches, likely from improper storage. Internally, the turntable looks completely original.
Initial testing revealed the arm lowering mechanism is slow, and the automatic RPM switching from 33 to 45 is not functioning, although manual switching works...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-a-new-arrival-and-a-first-look/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-a-new-arrival-and-a-first-look/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): Rebuilding the DC Motor and a Significant Improvement of the RPM Stability</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-rebuilding-the-dc-motor-and-a-significant-improvement-of-the-rpm-stability/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Sep 2023 02:36:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-rebuilding-the-dc-motor-and-a-significant-improvement-of-the-rpm-stability/</guid><description>A recently acquired Beogram 4002 turntable exhibited significant speed variations during an initial performance test. The frequent and irregular drops in rotations per minute (RPM) pointed to a need for cleaning and lubrication of the DC motor.
The motor was removed from its housing for servicing.
The motor was then disassembled to allow for cleaning and lubrication of its bearings.
Following reassembly and reinstallation of the motor, a 24-hour RPM test was conducted...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-rebuilding-the-dc-motor-and-a-significant-improvement-of-the-rpm-stability/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-rebuilding-the-dc-motor-and-a-significant-improvement-of-the-rpm-stability/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): Further Improvement of the RPM Stability Through Replacement of the RPM Trimmers and the RPM Relay</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-further-improvement-of-the-rpm-stability-through-replacement-of-the-rpm-trimmers-and-the-rpm-relay/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jun 2023 17:31:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-further-improvement-of-the-rpm-stability-through-replacement-of-the-rpm-trimmers-and-the-rpm-relay/</guid><description>Following the DC motor rebuild, which significantly enhanced the RPM stability of the Beogram 4002 (5513) restoration project, the main RPM trimmers and relay were replaced. It was hoped this would further improve RPM stability and bring the Beogram back to the 0.05% specification outlined in the service manual. While accessing the main PCB, all electrolytic capacitors were exchanged with high-quality, 105C grade Japanese-manufactured equivalents.

This particular Beogram 4002 had noticeable scratches on its cover, including a branded logo above the platter&amp;rsquo;s center.
Deep scratches that can be felt by hand require an initial sanding with 220-grit sandpaper to level the surface, creating a temporarily rough appearance.

A common issue with these units is low or absent volume in one or both channels, often caused by the output relay. To address this, I replaced it with a modern, durable Japanese relay designed to last for many years. The original output board is shown here:

After adjusting the sub-chassis and platter, I set the tonearm limits and calibrated the tracking force. It&amp;rsquo;s crucial to finalize the platter height before adjusting the arm, ensuring the correct arm-to-platter distance. My YouTube channel has videos demonstrating platter bearing and sub-chassis adjustments, particularly for the Beogram 4000, but the 4002 process is similar.
Here’s the result:
The platter is now centered and level within the main aluminum plate...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-adjusting-chassis-platter-tonearm-limits-and-tracking-force/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-adjusting-chassis-platter-tonearm-limits-and-tracking-force/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
