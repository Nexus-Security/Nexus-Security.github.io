Introduction It&amp;rsquo;s an honor to be presenting at Waseda University in Tokyo. Thank you to Professor Koji Tonami and Professor Kaoru Obata for making this lecture possible.
I am consistently impressed by the comprehensive understanding of fundamental rights protection within Japan&amp;rsquo;s legal system.</description></item><item><title>Is the European Arrest Warrant compatible with human rights?

The Amsterdam District Court, solely responsible for handling European Arrest Warrants (EAWs) in the Netherlands, faces a conflict between national and EU laws regarding detention and release. Dutch law mandates the release of a requested individual after 90 days if the court hasn&amp;rsquo;t made a decision on the EAW. However, a 2015 European Court of Justice (CJEU) ruling stated that national courts can extend detention beyond 90 days to ensure conditions for surrender are met.</description></item><item><title>Judicial oversight of suspected violations of fundamental rights in the execution of Eulex Kosovo and the Advocate General's Ćapeta's Opinion in Joined Cases C-29/22 P and C-44/22 P.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/judicial-oversight-of-suspected-violations-of-fundamental-rights-in-the-execution-of-eulex-kosovo-and-the-advocate-general-s-apeta-s-opinion-in-joined-cases-c-29-22-p-and-c-44-22-p/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2024 19:53:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/judicial-oversight-of-suspected-violations-of-fundamental-rights-in-the-execution-of-eulex-kosovo-and-the-advocate-general-s-apeta-s-opinion-in-joined-cases-c-29-22-p-and-c-44-22-p/</guid><description>Antje Kunst*

In a recent legal opinion, Advocate General Ćapeta addressed the question of whether individuals can sue the European Union for damages related to alleged fundamental rights violations during an EU mission. The case involved KS and KD, whose family members disappeared and were killed in Kosovo in 1999. They allege that Eulex Kosovo, an EU mission tasked with investigating such crimes, failed to adequately investigate their cases.</description></item><item><title>The Bosphorus presumption remains in effect in EU law and the ECHR, as demonstrated in the case of Avotiņš v.

The regulation of hate speech has recently resurfaced as a crucial legal and political topic in Europe. While the complexity of this issue and the varying views on balancing legislation with rights protection are well-known, the contrasting approaches of the EU and the Council of Europe, two closely linked entities, is notable. This difference raises questions about its underlying reasons and broader legislative ramifications in Europe.</description></item><item><title>Examining the ECtHR ruling in the Big Brother Watch case: part 2</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/examining-the-ecthr-ruling-in-the-big-brother-watch-case-part-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Dec 2023 08:23:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/examining-the-ecthr-ruling-in-the-big-brother-watch-case-part-2/</guid><description>Lorna Woods, Professor of Internet Law, University of Essex
(These observations on the judgment follow part 1 of the analysis, which explained the Court’s reasoning).
The Big Brother Watch judgment can be interpreted in two ways: as confirmation that mass surveillance is permissible (para 314) or as an acknowledgment that the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA) framework was inadequate. This implies that the Investigatory Powers Act (IPA), which inherited some of RIPA&amp;rsquo;s shortcomings, is also lacking.</description></item><item><title>Balancing religious tolerance with freedom of expression in ECHR case law: Is there a right to insult?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/balancing-religious-tolerance-with-freedom-of-expression-in-echr-case-law-is-there-a-right-to-insult/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Oct 2023 00:42:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/balancing-religious-tolerance-with-freedom-of-expression-in-echr-case-law-is-there-a-right-to-insult/</guid><description>Professor Steve Peers, University of Essex
A recent ruling by the European Court of Human Rights has reignited the debate about whether freedom of speech should have limitations, particularly when it comes to potentially offensive remarks targeting religious beliefs, such as those of the Muslim faith. This presents an opportunity to analyze the case&amp;rsquo;s background and determine what, if any, restrictions on free speech are justifiable in such instances.</description></item><item><title>Expanding the margin of appreciation: France's prohibition on public face-veiling</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/expanding-the-margin-of-appreciation-france-s-prohibition-on-public-face-veiling/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Aug 2023 05:03:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/expanding-the-margin-of-appreciation-france-s-prohibition-on-public-face-veiling/</guid><description>The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has ruled on a highly anticipated case, SAS v France, concerning France&amp;rsquo;s 2010 law prohibiting face coverings in public.

In a landmark decision, a UK court has disapplied portions of a UK Act of Parliament for the first time since Brexit due to conflicts with the Withdrawal Agreement, specifically highlighting the ongoing connection between UK and EU legal systems. This unexpected development, though previously argued for, underscores the UK government&amp;rsquo;s consistent underestimation of Article 2&amp;rsquo;s impact on rights-related cases.</description></item><item><title>New ECHR ruling on freedom of expression and internet comment liability</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/new-echr-ruling-on-freedom-of-expression-and-internet-comment-liability/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Feb 2023 13:54:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/new-echr-ruling-on-freedom-of-expression-and-internet-comment-liability/</guid><description>Lorna Woods, Professor of Internet Law, University of Essex
A recent case before the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) raises the question of whether internet site providers should be held accountable for comments made by users. This issue gained significance following the court&amp;rsquo;s ruling in MTE v. Hungary.
Considering the importance of intermediaries in the internet&amp;rsquo;s growth, there are arguments for not treating them like traditional publishers. Instead, they could be granted some immunity regarding content posted by others.</description></item><item><title>Opinion 2/13 on EU accession to the ECHR: Searching for the Positive Aspect</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/opinion-2-13-on-eu-accession-to-the-echr-searching-for-the-positive-aspect/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Feb 2023 16:17:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/opinion-2-13-on-eu-accession-to-the-echr-searching-for-the-positive-aspect/</guid><description>Catherine Barnard, Trinity College, Cambridge
Introduction Opinion 2/13 is a legal judgment with significant political consequences. It provides a thorough examination of the Draft Accession Agreement (DAA) clauses and fundamental EU law principles. While some have offered helpful explanations of the Opinion, others have criticized it intensely. This piece aims to explore a more favorable interpretation of the Opinion, focusing on three key points: the potential oversight of the bigger picture during negotiations, whether Opinion 2/13 was an act of judicial self-importance, and its impact on the relationship between the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) and the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR).</description></item><item><title>The EU Charter of Rights post Conservative party amendments to UK human rights legislation</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-eu-charter-of-rights-post-conservative-party-amendments-to-uk-human-rights-legislation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Dec 2022 07:45:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-eu-charter-of-rights-post-conservative-party-amendments-to-uk-human-rights-legislation/</guid><description>Steve Peers
Many drivers have encountered the unfortunate experience of hitting a small animal that darted across the road at the wrong moment. Reactions vary from distress to indifference, but some feel a sense of triumph, having removed an obstacle from their path.
This last reaction mirrors the Conservative party&amp;rsquo;s stance on EU law within their UK human rights law reform proposals. They aim to diminish EU law&amp;rsquo;s influence, much like a driver indifferent to roadkill.</description></item><item><title>The European Court of Human Rights highlights the significance of encryption in the case of Podchasov v.

Despite aiming for high human rights protection standards, the EU&amp;rsquo;s Dublin system, which assigns responsibility for each asylum-seeker to one Member State, has repeatedly encountered human rights issues. The recent European Court of Human Rights (&amp;lsquo;ECtHR&amp;rsquo;) judgments in Tarakhel v Switzerland and Sharifi v Italy and Greece further highlight the difficulties in aligning this system with ECHR obligations. Notably, the Tarakhel judgment goes beyond previous rulings by demonstrating that the Court of Justice of the European Union&amp;rsquo;s (CJEU) interpretation of the Dublin rules also conflicts with the ECHR.</description></item><item><title>In the case of Schipani v Italy, under what circumstances is it necessary for national courts to seek guidance from the CJEU as per the ECHR?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/in-the-case-of-schipani-v-italy-under-what-circumstances-is-it-necessary-for-national-courts-to-seek-guidance-from-the-cjeu-as-per-the-echr/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Oct 2022 11:15:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/in-the-case-of-schipani-v-italy-under-what-circumstances-is-it-necessary-for-national-courts-to-seek-guidance-from-the-cjeu-as-per-the-echr/</guid><description>Daniel Sarmiento, Professor of EU Law at the University Complutense of Madrid*
The European Court of Human Rights&amp;rsquo; (ECHR) judgment in the Schipani vs. Italy case, issued on July 21, 2015, revisited a topic of significant interest to EU legal experts: the violation of the ECHR by a national court due to its failure to request a preliminary ruling.

A key point of contention is the return of migrants arriving in Greece to Turkey.

Introduction
With a large influx of Ukrainian refugees into Europe, alongside policies like offshore asylum processing in Denmark and the UK, and increasing irregular entries reported by Frontex, the landscape of migration laws and policies is constantly shifting. Amidst these changes, it&amp;rsquo;s vital to examine the legal context, especially the human rights framework meant to safeguard individuals.</description></item><item><title>The case of Elgizouli v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2020] UKSC 10 involves issues related to data protection, the death penalty, and mutual legal assistance in criminal law.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-case-of-elgizouli-v-secretary-of-state-for-the-home-department-2020-uksc-10-involves-issues-related-to-data-protection-the-death-penalty-and-mutual-legal-assistance-in-criminal-law/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Aug 2022 15:07:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-case-of-elgizouli-v-secretary-of-state-for-the-home-department-2020-uksc-10-involves-issues-related-to-data-protection-the-death-penalty-and-mutual-legal-assistance-in-criminal-law/</guid><description>Lorna Woods, Professor of Internet Law, University of Essex
Introduction
The Elgizouli case marks the first UK Supreme Court ruling on the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA). The key takeaway is that simply mostly complying with the Act&amp;rsquo;s requirements isn&amp;rsquo;t enough to legalize data transfers to other countries. This judgment centers around Part Three of the DPA, which puts the Law Enforcement Directive into action and emphasizes procedural safeguards. However, the court&amp;rsquo;s methodology might have broader consequences for how UK courts interpret the DPA and the GDPR, particularly regarding the protection of individual rights outlined in the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).</description></item><item><title>Is it possible to renegotiate the UK's membership of the EU?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-possible-to-renegotiate-the-uk-s-membership-of-the-eu/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jul 2022 03:14:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-possible-to-renegotiate-the-uk-s-membership-of-the-eu/</guid><description>Steve Peers
Can the UK renegotiate its EU membership terms? This question is easier to answer after analyzing David Cameron&amp;rsquo;s stated objectives for such a renegotiation.
The Telegraph summarized these objectives into seven key points, which we will examine individually.
Firstly, limiting the movement of people from countries joining the EU in the future. This wouldn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily require a Treaty amendment, as accession treaties require unanimous agreement. However, if the goal is to allow for potentially indefinite delays in free movement, a Treaty amendment might be needed, as this represents a permanent exception to a fundamental Treaty rule.</description></item><item><title>The ECHR provides clarification on the use of hidden cameras in relation to human rights.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-echr-provides-clarification-on-the-use-of-hidden-cameras-in-relation-to-human-rights/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jun 2022 20:42:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-echr-provides-clarification-on-the-use-of-hidden-cameras-in-relation-to-human-rights/</guid><description>Lorna Woods, Professor of Internet Law, University of Essex
A recent ruling by the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Bremner v Turkey provides clarity on the use of hidden cameras by journalists and potential human rights violations. The case involved an Australian citizen, Bremner, who was secretly filmed in his apartment discussing Christianity for a documentary about &amp;ldquo;foreign peddlers of religion&amp;rdquo; in Turkey.

The Labour Party&amp;rsquo;s 2019 Annual Conference has drawn significant attention, particularly for its resolution to eliminate private schools in the UK. This highlights the need to examine politicians&amp;rsquo; passionate pronouncements in light of legal realities, especially international and human rights law. Similar situations arose earlier this year when Theresa May presented a unilateral statement on the UK&amp;rsquo;s interpretation of the Withdrawal Agreement Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland and when Geoffrey Cox MP incorrectly suggested that the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) offered a simple solution to the Brexit withdrawal agreement and the backstop.</description></item><item><title>The Court of Appeal ruling in Benkharbouche and Janah: State immunity, remedies, and rights.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-court-of-appeal-ruling-in-benkharbouche-and-janah-state-immunity-remedies-and-rights/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jun 2022 20:57:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-court-of-appeal-ruling-in-benkharbouche-and-janah-state-immunity-remedies-and-rights/</guid><description>Steve Peers

The cases involved employment law claims brought by two domestic workers against the Sudanese and Libyan embassies, respectively. The embassies invoked state immunity under a UK law based on a Council of Europe Convention.</description></item></channel></rss>
