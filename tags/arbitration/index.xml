The Scope of the Agreement

The connection between arbitral tribunals and the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has been a source of legal debate for many years. While the present situation is straightforward and practical, it is not without controversy. Commercial arbitration tribunals are not seen as &amp;ldquo;courts or tribunals of a Member State&amp;rdquo; as defined by Article 267 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-luxembourg-court-providing-assistance-in-preliminary-references-and-investment-tribunals/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-luxembourg-court-providing-assistance-in-preliminary-references-and-investment-tribunals/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Resolving conflicts and the agreement for the UK's exit from the EU</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/resolving-conflicts-and-the-agreement-for-the-uk-s-exit-from-the-eu/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jun 2023 21:48:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/resolving-conflicts-and-the-agreement-for-the-uk-s-exit-from-the-eu/</guid><description>Professor Steve Peers, University of Essex
