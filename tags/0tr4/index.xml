I removed the turntable from its case and took off the aluminum plates to examine it. When I powered it on, it initially started up as usual, but the arm wouldn&amp;rsquo;t lower at the record&amp;rsquo;s starting point. Instead, there was a strong burning smell and a plume of smoke coming from the circuit board with the carriage switches.</description></item></channel></rss>
