The analysis focuses on how the European Commission&amp;rsquo;s proposals within the Pact could affect the fundamental rights of stateless migrants and refugees. It offers suggestions for addressing these concerns during Pact negotiations and implementation.
The Pact, as it stands, fails to directly address the rights of stateless individuals or offer solutions to the specific protection issues they encounter...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/how-the-eu-migration-and-asylum-pact-can-address-its-blind-spot-on-statelessness/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/how-the-eu-migration-and-asylum-pact-can-address-its-blind-spot-on-statelessness/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Does Rottmann Rule apply in the UK?

The UK Supreme Court recently examined the meaning and implications of the CJEU&amp;rsquo;s Rottmann judgment, which deals with EU law limitations on the revocation of national citizenship. The British Home Secretary&amp;rsquo;s legal representative contended that interpreting the judgment beyond cross-border situations would exceed the CJEU&amp;rsquo;s authority. The Court questioned if it could rule on the application of Rottmann before consulting the CJEU, a proposal the Government did not strongly contest...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/does-rottmann-rule-apply-in-the-uk-can-british-citizenship-be-revoked-without-consideration-of-eu-law/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/does-rottmann-rule-apply-in-the-uk-can-british-citizenship-be-revoked-without-consideration-of-eu-law/</a></p></description></item><item><title>People without nationality and refugees escaping Ukraine</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/people-without-nationality-and-refugees-escaping-ukraine/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Aug 2023 08:20:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/people-without-nationality-and-refugees-escaping-ukraine/</guid><description>Chris Nash, Director of the European Network on Statelessness*

As the number of people seeking refuge from the conflict in Ukraine approaches two million, our organization and our members working in the region are working to understand the specific needs of stateless individuals displaced by this crisis.
Based on previous experiences, including our research from the Stateless Journeys initiative, we know that stateless people fleeing from conflict encounter additional obstacles when crossing borders and seeking asylum...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/people-without-nationality-and-refugees-escaping-ukraine/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/people-without-nationality-and-refugees-escaping-ukraine/</a></p></description></item><item><title>People from another place?

*This blog post draws from the upcoming second edition of The EU Citizenship Directive (OUP, 2019), co-authored by myself, Elspeth Guild, and Jonathan Tomkin.
Typically, the rules governing the acquisition and loss of nationality are decided by individual Member States. However, this issue is central to EU law because, as stated in Article 20(1) TFEU, EU citizenship is reliant on possessing the nationality of a Member State:..<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/people-from-another-place-eu-citizenship-and-the-renunciation-of-national-citizenship-in-member-states/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/people-from-another-place-eu-citizenship-and-the-renunciation-of-national-citizenship-in-member-states/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Ensuring the right to a nationality for children of same-sex couples in the EU - A crucial matter in the case of V.M.A. v Stolichna Obsthina (C-490/20) before the CJEU.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ensuring-the-right-to-a-nationality-for-children-of-same-sex-couples-in-the-eu-a-crucial-matter-in-the-case-of-v-m-a-v-stolichna-obsthina-c-490-20-before-the-cjeu/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Nov 2022 09:11:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ensuring-the-right-to-a-nationality-for-children-of-same-sex-couples-in-the-eu-a-crucial-matter-in-the-case-of-v-m-a-v-stolichna-obsthina-c-490-20-before-the-cjeu/</guid><description>Patr√≠cia Cabral, Legal Policy Officer, European Network on Statelessness*
The recognition of LGBTQ* rights, including same-sex partnerships or marriages and legal parentage for same-sex couples, varies significantly across Europe. This inconsistent landscape presents challenges for rainbow families (families with at least one LGBTQ* parent), particularly regarding the legal recognition of their civil status, birth registration processes, and access to birth certificates. Consequently, some children in these families face statelessness or a heightened risk of it...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ensuring-the-right-to-a-nationality-for-children-of-same-sex-couples-in-the-eu-a-crucial-matter-in-the-case-of-v-m-a-v-stolichna-obsthina-c-490-20-before-the-cjeu/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ensuring-the-right-to-a-nationality-for-children-of-same-sex-couples-in-the-eu-a-crucial-matter-in-the-case-of-v-m-a-v-stolichna-obsthina-c-490-20-before-the-cjeu/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
