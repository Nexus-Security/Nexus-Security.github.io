The rapid emergence of the Coronavirus pandemic is speeding up existing trends, particularly telemedicine and remote work. Both heavily rely on broadband internet bandwidth. Let&amp;rsquo;s explore the available connection options.
Connecting the User
Most remote workers and telemedicine patients connect from home using devices like desktops, smartphones, laptops, or tablets. Home users often prefer cable broadband with speeds of 30 to 100 Mbps, while remote users rely on public WiFi or 4G/5G cellular broadband...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/connectivity-for-telemedicine-and-remote-work/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/connectivity-for-telemedicine-and-remote-work/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Bandwidth Options for Healthcare Providers</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/bandwidth-options-for-healthcare-providers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Dec 2022 08:00:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/bandwidth-options-for-healthcare-providers/</guid><description>By: John Shepler
In today&amp;rsquo;s healthcare landscape, broadband connectivity is crucial, driven by the increasing use of electronic health records, medical imaging, and telemedicine. When establishing an effective EHR environment, it&amp;rsquo;s essential to consider both private lines and public internet bandwidth services.
While both serve a purpose, private lines offer secure internal communication channels ideal for organizations managing sensitive electronic data. Essentially, these lines act as an extension of your network, ensuring restricted access to authorized users only...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/bandwidth-options-for-healthcare-providers/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/bandwidth-options-for-healthcare-providers/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Can Ethernet Enable Electronic Health Care?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/can-ethernet-enable-electronic-health-care/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jul 2022 01:05:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/can-ethernet-enable-electronic-health-care/</guid><description>The healthcare industry has significant potential for service enhancement and cost reduction. Digitizing, storing, and transferring medical records, along with automating administrative tasks, are readily achievable improvements. Additionally, innovations like remote diagnostics can extend healthcare access to underserved areas and emergency situations. However, the lack of widespread broadband infrastructure, particularly in rural areas, hinders progress.
The limited availability of high-speed internet connections poses a significant obstacle. Many healthcare facilities rely on outdated T1 lines, which are inadequate for transmitting large, high-resolution medical images and electronic medical records, impacting productivity...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/can-ethernet-enable-electronic-health-care/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/can-ethernet-enable-electronic-health-care/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
