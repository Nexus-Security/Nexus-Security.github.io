This investment presents a potential win-win situation, offering both short-term job creation and long-term economic benefits.
One study projects the creation of approximately 5,000 immediate jobs from these high-speed internet projects. While seemingly small compared to the number of job seekers, it&amp;rsquo;s a step in the right direction.</description></item><item><title>What Real Estate Developers Need to Know About Ethernet</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-real-estate-developers-need-to-know-about-ethernet/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Aug 2023 23:03:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-real-estate-developers-need-to-know-about-ethernet/</guid><description>High-speed internet is becoming as essential as other utilities like electricity, water, and phone services. Businesses rely on it, and those working from home expect it. Developers of office spaces, industrial parks, and new housing divisions should incorporate broadband internet into their plans, rather than making it the responsibility of buyers or renters. Broadband access is not just a desirable feature, but a potential revenue source, and Ethernet is the best technology for the job.</description></item><item><title>Vertiv declares utilities as the most crucial industry globally</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/vertiv-declares-utilities-as-the-most-crucial-industry-globally/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Aug 2023 18:13:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/vertiv-declares-utilities-as-the-most-crucial-industry-globally/</guid><description>A new study from Vertiv, formerly Emerson Network Power, has found that utilities, including electricity, gas, nuclear power, and water treatment, are the world&amp;rsquo;s most critical industries.
Vertiv assembled a group of international experts in critical infrastructure to develop a system for quantifying and ranking the criticality of various industries based on 15 criteria. Public transportation, particularly rail and air travel, came in second place, followed by telecommunications, upstream oil and gas operations, and cloud and colocation services.</description></item><item><title>Got a Bandwidth Jones</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/got-a-bandwidth-jones/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jul 2023 13:38:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/got-a-bandwidth-jones/</guid><description>There&amp;rsquo;s no limit to how much bandwidth we need, similar to how we always desire more money, health, or chocolate. As we gain more bandwidth, we discover new ways to utilize it. The most sought-after types are wireless, offering flexibility, and fiber optic, providing high capacity. Property owners who provide both to their business tenants might find their properties more appealing than those offering health, wealth, or even delicious chocolate.</description></item></channel></rss>
