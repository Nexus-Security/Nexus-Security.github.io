Although the main board was restored, the presence of rust and corrosion discovered earlier took priority. Addressing rust requires applying neutralizer and paint, which involves drying time between coats, thus delaying the planned reservoir capacitor and output board work.
Images highlighting the most severe rust spots are included.
Despite the significant rust, the turntable&amp;rsquo;s overall condition is good. To combat the rust, three coats of rust neutralizer were applied...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-from-oil-cleanup-to-first-operational-test/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-from-oil-cleanup-to-first-operational-test/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
