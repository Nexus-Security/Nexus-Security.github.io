We should treat our planet with respect or face the consequences. Speaking of which, why not make some money while being environmentally conscious?

Hold on to your hats, folks, because global warming is here, and it&amp;rsquo;s not waiting for anyone. We&amp;rsquo;re already seeing the effects, despite what some people might believe. Forget those freezing Midwest winters; the Arctic Ocean is melting at an alarming rate, opening up shipping routes and sparking international interest in its resources.

We already established that alternative energy is a viable option, as solar and wind power are readily available. However, skeptics often question how to ensure a consistent energy supply when natural resources like sunlight and wind are inconsistent.

This ideal world, fueled by boundless energy, feels perpetually out of reach, forcing us to rely on polluting coal and oil.
This is absurd. We possess the technology to transition away from fossil fuels immediately.
Our obstacle isn&amp;rsquo;t technological, but mental.
