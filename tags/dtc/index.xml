DTCPing again proved useful in troubleshooting.
The client was using eConnect on a docked laptop with both wireless and wired connections. DTCPing from the client to the server worked, but the server&amp;rsquo;s DTCPing to the client resulted in a &amp;ldquo;gethostbyname failure&amp;rdquo; error.

This error, lacking detailed information, occurs during the eConnect_EntryPoint call when creating a new GL account.
Two potential solutions were explored.
