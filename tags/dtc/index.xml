DTCPing again proved useful in troubleshooting.
The client was using eConnect on a docked laptop with both wireless and wired connections. DTCPing from the client to the server worked, but the server&amp;rsquo;s DTCPing to the client resulted in a &amp;ldquo;gethostbyname failure&amp;rdquo; error.
The laptop&amp;rsquo;s wireless card had an address on a different subnet than the wired connection.</description></item><item><title>eConnect Error: "The transaction has already been committed or aborted.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/econnect-error-the-transaction-has-already-been-committed-or-aborted/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Dec 2022 00:51:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/econnect-error-the-transaction-has-already-been-committed-or-aborted/</guid><description>A client encountered an error (&amp;ldquo;The transaction has already been implicitly or explicitly committed or aborted.&amp;rdquo;) with their previously functional eConnect integration after a server migration to a new data center. This error, lacking detailed information, occurs during the eConnect_EntryPoint call when creating a new GL account.
Two potential solutions were explored. The first, adding &amp;ldquo;Enlist=False&amp;rdquo; to the eConnect connection string, resolved the error but was identified as a workaround that disables transactions and might lead to data corruption.</description></item></channel></rss>
