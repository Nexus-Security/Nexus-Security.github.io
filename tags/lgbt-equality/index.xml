The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) issued its first ruling on same-sex marriage within the framework of EU free movement law in the case of Coman. This case involved a Romanian citizen, Mr. Coman, who married his American husband in Belgium while residing there. When they attempted to return to Romania, the Romanian government, which does not legally acknowledge same-sex marriage, refused residency to Mr...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/love-triumphs-in-the-cjeu-equal-marriage-and-eu-freedom-of-movement-legislation/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/love-triumphs-in-the-cjeu-equal-marriage-and-eu-freedom-of-movement-legislation/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Jonathan Sumption's perspective on human rights is not coherent when considering the historical context of gay rights.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/jonathan-sumption-s-perspective-on-human-rights-is-not-coherent-when-considering-the-historical-context-of-gay-rights/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 May 2023 14:35:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/jonathan-sumption-s-perspective-on-human-rights-is-not-coherent-when-considering-the-historical-context-of-gay-rights/</guid><description>In his Reith Lecture, “Human Rights and Wrongs,” Jonathan Sumption argues that the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has overstepped its boundaries. He believes the court continuously expands its interpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights, creating new rights and encroaching on areas that should be determined by elected officials.
Sumption has raised similar concerns previously, stating in 2016 that the ECtHR is at the forefront of creating fundamental law that goes beyond the original text of the Convention...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/jonathan-sumption-s-perspective-on-human-rights-is-not-coherent-when-considering-the-historical-context-of-gay-rights/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/jonathan-sumption-s-perspective-on-human-rights-is-not-coherent-when-considering-the-historical-context-of-gay-rights/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The case of V.M.A. v Stolichna obshtina, rayon 'Pancharevo' and the rights of rainbow families to freedom of movement.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-case-of-v-m-a-v-stolichna-obshtina-rayon-pancharevo-and-the-rights-of-rainbow-families-to-freedom-of-movement/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Feb 2023 06:27:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-case-of-v-m-a-v-stolichna-obshtina-rayon-pancharevo-and-the-rights-of-rainbow-families-to-freedom-of-movement/</guid><description>Chiara De Capitani, Linguist agent at the European Commission and honorary fellow European Union law at the University of Naples &amp;ldquo;L&amp;rsquo;Orientale&amp;rdquo;.

Hungary&amp;rsquo;s Actions Raise Concerns Again
Hungary has been under scrutiny for controversial actions. Viktor Orban&amp;rsquo;s right-wing government has faced criticism from parts of Hungarian society and European institutions for policies targeting specific universities, constructing border barriers to deter refugees, and implementing other contentious measures. A recent source of alarm is Hungary&amp;rsquo;s treatment of asylum seekers, particularly those claiming persecution based on sexual orientation, an area already subject to criticism...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/examine-what-you-observe-and-i-will-determine-if-you-are-homosexual-evaluating-the-advocate-general-s-viewpoint-in-case-c-473-16-f-v-bev-ndorl-si-s-llampolg-rs-gi-hivatal/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/examine-what-you-observe-and-i-will-determine-if-you-are-homosexual-evaluating-the-advocate-general-s-viewpoint-in-case-c-473-16-f-v-bev-ndorl-si-s-llampolg-rs-gi-hivatal/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Ensuring the right to a nationality for children of same-sex couples in the EU - A crucial matter in the case of V.M.A. v Stolichna Obsthina (C-490/20) before the CJEU.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ensuring-the-right-to-a-nationality-for-children-of-same-sex-couples-in-the-eu-a-crucial-matter-in-the-case-of-v-m-a-v-stolichna-obsthina-c-490-20-before-the-cjeu/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Nov 2022 09:11:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ensuring-the-right-to-a-nationality-for-children-of-same-sex-couples-in-the-eu-a-crucial-matter-in-the-case-of-v-m-a-v-stolichna-obsthina-c-490-20-before-the-cjeu/</guid><description>Patrícia Cabral, Legal Policy Officer, European Network on Statelessness*
The recognition of LGBTQ* rights, including same-sex partnerships or marriages and legal parentage for same-sex couples, varies significantly across Europe. This inconsistent landscape presents challenges for rainbow families (families with at least one LGBTQ* parent), particularly regarding the legal recognition of their civil status, birth registration processes, and access to birth certificates. Consequently, some children in these families face statelessness or a heightened risk of it...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ensuring-the-right-to-a-nationality-for-children-of-same-sex-couples-in-the-eu-a-crucial-matter-in-the-case-of-v-m-a-v-stolichna-obsthina-c-490-20-before-the-cjeu/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ensuring-the-right-to-a-nationality-for-children-of-same-sex-couples-in-the-eu-a-crucial-matter-in-the-case-of-v-m-a-v-stolichna-obsthina-c-490-20-before-the-cjeu/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The CJEU judgment in NH v Associazione Avvocatura per i diritti LGBTI — Rete Lenford has erased the blurry line between employment discrimination and the right to freedom of expression.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-judgment-in-nh-v-associazione-avvocatura-per-i-diritti-lgbti-rete-lenford-has-erased-the-blurry-line-between-employment-discrimination-and-the-right-to-freedom-of-expression/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Jul 2022 20:39:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-judgment-in-nh-v-associazione-avvocatura-per-i-diritti-lgbti-rete-lenford-has-erased-the-blurry-line-between-employment-discrimination-and-the-right-to-freedom-of-expression/</guid><description>Chiara De Capitani, Ph.D. Researcher in International Studies at the University of Naples &amp;ldquo;L&amp;rsquo;Orientale&amp;rdquo;
Introduction
The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) case C‑507/18, NH v Associazione Avvocatura per i diritti LGBTI — Rete Lenford, centers around the balance between freedom of expression and the harmful impact of discriminatory language. Advocate General Eleanor Sharpston aptly used bird metaphors in her opinion, likening discriminatory statements to volatile birds that can quickly spread their harmful effects...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-judgment-in-nh-v-associazione-avvocatura-per-i-diritti-lgbti-rete-lenford-has-erased-the-blurry-line-between-employment-discrimination-and-the-right-to-freedom-of-expression/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-judgment-in-nh-v-associazione-avvocatura-per-i-diritti-lgbti-rete-lenford-has-erased-the-blurry-line-between-employment-discrimination-and-the-right-to-freedom-of-expression/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Should there be increased use of majority voting in EU social policy decisions?

In April 2019, the European Commission initiated a discussion on streamlining the EU&amp;rsquo;s decision-making in social policy. The goal was to enhance efficiency by utilizing &amp;ldquo;passerelle&amp;rdquo; clauses, which permit a shift from unanimous voting to qualified majority voting (QMV) and from special to ordinary legislative procedures. This change, while requiring unanimous approval from Member States, aims to bypass the complexities of Treaty revisions...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/should-there-be-increased-use-of-majority-voting-in-eu-social-policy-decisions-evaluating-the-commission-s-suggestion/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/should-there-be-increased-use-of-majority-voting-in-eu-social-policy-decisions-evaluating-the-commission-s-suggestion/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
