This is notable because Verizon uses the CDMA network in the US, while the rest of the world primarily uses GSM.

In the US, the CDMA component accesses the 800 and 1900 MHz bands, including EV-DO broadband. Outside the US, the GSM component accesses the 900 and 1800 MHz bands, including GPRS broadband.</description></item><item><title>Phoneless in a Strange Land</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/phoneless-in-a-strange-land/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Sep 2023 04:43:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/phoneless-in-a-strange-land/</guid><description>We depend so heavily on our cell phones that we rarely consider what we&amp;rsquo;d do if they were unavailable or malfunctioning.
