To reattach the red-green covers, I secured the display to ensure a tight seal, preventing light leakage. Using a soldering iron, I melted the plastic posts of the covers, replicating the original attachment method.
During cleaning, the glue holding the light guide dissolved, indicating it was likely polyvinyl ester-based. I used &amp;lsquo;Aleene&amp;rsquo;s Original Tacky Glue&amp;rsquo; as a substitute, providing a clear and durable bond...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-restoration-of-the-peak-program-meter-with-smd-leds-ii-/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-restoration-of-the-peak-program-meter-with-smd-leds-ii-/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beocord 5000 (4716/4715): First Contact</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-5000-47164715-first-contact/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Aug 2022 10:37:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-5000-47164715-first-contact/</guid><description>After a couple of evenings with the Beomaster 6000, my curiosity led me to the non-working Beocord 5000 (4716). The design is quite impressive, especially the electronic VU meters that use seven incandescent light bulbs each. This cutting-edge technology from the past is incredible! The attention to detail is remarkable.
Here are some pictures:

This common issue stems from the age of the bulbs, as their leads tend to oxidize and break under pressure.
The initial state of the display, lacking illumination for the numbers on the dB scale, is shown below:
The bulb is inserted into a waveguide that distributes light across the scale, with a textured surface behind the numbers for diffusion...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-peak-program-meter-scale-illumination-with-a-redgreen-led/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-peak-program-meter-scale-illumination-with-a-redgreen-led/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beocord 5000 (4715/4716): Exchanging the Belts</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-5000-47154716-exchanging-the-belts/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Jul 2022 12:14:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-5000-47154716-exchanging-the-belts/</guid><description>After removing the tape mechanism from the Beocord 5000 (4715) for rebuilding, I replaced the old, worn-out belts. My process was largely based on the one shown in my YouTube video.
However, I made one key improvement. I learned that the eject lever&amp;rsquo;s alignment with the tape mechanism is vital for the eject key to function correctly after reassembly. Previously, I had only marked the position of part #256 (&amp;ldquo;lever&amp;rdquo;) with a pencil, leading to time-consuming readjustments...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-5000-47154716-exchanging-the-belts/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-5000-47154716-exchanging-the-belts/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beocord 9000: Rebuilding the Pinch (Rubber) Roller</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-rebuilding-the-pinch-rubber-roller/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jul 2022 22:12:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-rebuilding-the-pinch-rubber-roller/</guid><description>The last step in restoring my Beocord 9000 is fixing the worn-out pinch roller, a common problem in these decks given their age. These decks are over 30 years old, surpassing the lifespan of most rubber components. For optimal performance, a pinch roller rebuild is essential.
Fortunately, Terry Witt of Terry&amp;rsquo;s Rubber Rollers &amp;amp; Wheels is an expert in restoring tape rollers.
