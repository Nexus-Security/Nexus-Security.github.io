The unit is in good cosmetic condition with minor wear. Upon inspection, the platter motor ran when turned on, but the carriage remained static.
Further investigation revealed that transistor TR20, responsible for the carriage motor control, was faulty. Replacing this component restored carriage movement.
However, the carriage would move only slightly before returning to its starting position...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-first-contact-and-two-dead-transistors/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-first-contact-and-two-dead-transistors/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
