Edinburgh), Ph.D. candidate and academic assistant at the German Police University, argues that the &amp;ldquo;prohibited purpose&amp;rdquo; requirement, while crucial, is not the only factor differentiating torture from inhuman or degrading treatment.

The Judgment
Mr. Cestaro, a peaceful protester at the 2001 G-8 summit in Genoa, Italy, was subjected to severe beatings by Italian police while staying at a school being searched for radical protesters.</description></item></channel></rss>
