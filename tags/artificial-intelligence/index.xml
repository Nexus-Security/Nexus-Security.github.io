1. Proposal Goals
The European Commission&amp;rsquo;s proposal for an AI Liability Directive, published on September 28, 2022, alongside an updated Product Liability Directive, aims to address the risks posed by artificial intelligence (AI) while acknowledging its potential benefits. The proposal stems from a report recognizing the potential harm AI systems can cause due to their connectivity, unpredictable nature, and opacity, which makes it difficult to assign responsibility for AI-related incidents.</description></item><item><title>The European Union should consider the UK police's use of live facial recognition technology when developing regulations for law enforcement.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-european-union-should-consider-the-uk-police-s-use-of-live-facial-recognition-technology-when-developing-regulations-for-law-enforcement/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jun 2024 14:07:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-european-union-should-consider-the-uk-police-s-use-of-live-facial-recognition-technology-when-developing-regulations-for-law-enforcement/</guid><description>Divergent Approaches to Regulating Live Facial Recognition Dr. Asress Adimi Gikay, a Senior Lecturer in AI, Disruptive Innovation, and Law at Brunel University London, explores the contrasting approaches to regulating live facial recognition (LFR) in the UK and the European Union.
Recent suggestions by UK officials to use LFR for searching national passport databases to combat shoplifting have sparked debate, particularly as London, a city with a high concentration of CCTV cameras, grapples with AI safety concerns.</description></item><item><title>Is it necessary for the EU to prohibit the real-time use of remote biometric identification systems for law enforcement purposes?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-necessary-for-the-eu-to-prohibit-the-real-time-use-of-remote-biometric-identification-systems-for-law-enforcement-purposes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Sep 2023 23:13:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-necessary-for-the-eu-to-prohibit-the-real-time-use-of-remote-biometric-identification-systems-for-law-enforcement-purposes/</guid><description>Asress Adimi Gikay (PhD)

Why a Complete Ban on Real-Time Remote Biometric Identification Systems Is Not the Answer
The European Commission&amp;rsquo;s proposed Artificial Intelligence Act (EU-AIA), intended to regulate AI use, has faced criticism since its introduction two years ago. A key point of contention is the regulation&amp;rsquo;s stance on law enforcement&amp;rsquo;s use of Real-Time Remote Biometric Identification Systems (RT-RBIS) in public spaces.</description></item><item><title>AI Is Going to Eat Your Bandwidth</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ai-is-going-to-eat-your-bandwidth/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Aug 2023 20:08:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ai-is-going-to-eat-your-bandwidth/</guid><description>By: John Shepler
Human communication might not dominate telecom usage for much longer. It started when computers began sharing data over phone lines and sped up when broadband internet connected almost every computer. Even though people currently use the internet for websites, messaging, social media, videos, backups, and work, machines will soon be the primary users, communicating amongst themselves.
The Rise of Artificial Intelligence
Artificial intelligence, or AI, has been subtly infiltrating our lives for decades, likely since computers emerged.</description></item><item><title>The Challenges and Benefits of Contemporary Romance: Legal Ramifications of Algorithmic Online Dating</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-challenges-and-benefits-of-contemporary-romance-legal-ramifications-of-algorithmic-online-dating/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jun 2023 04:05:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-challenges-and-benefits-of-contemporary-romance-legal-ramifications-of-algorithmic-online-dating/</guid><description>Tessa Sophie Hoffmann &amp;amp; Chrisa Alexiou (University of Groningen)

Introduction
As Tony Milligan wisely observed in 2011, love is a complex emotion, capable of bringing immense joy and unexpected delight, but also capable of causing pain and disappointment. While the pursuit of love has existed long before the digital age, technology and artificial intelligence (AI) have dramatically changed the landscape, with over 48 million Europeans turning to dating platforms to find potential partners.</description></item><item><title>How AI is Helping to Improve Call Centers</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/how-ai-is-helping-to-improve-call-centers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Nov 2022 22:16:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/how-ai-is-helping-to-improve-call-centers/</guid><description>By: John Shepler
Customer service calls are increasingly frustrating due to rising costs and labor shortages, negatively impacting both customers and companies. Tech expert David Pogue, in a CBS News report, suggests a blend of human agents and AI as a solution.
One such AI, called Grace, can handle customer interactions independently. However, AI like Grace can falter in complex situations, necessitating a transfer to human agents. While some of the best agents are located internationally and may have accents, this can be a hurdle for some US customers.</description></item><item><title>Helping Your Business Achieve Hyperconnectivity</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/helping-your-business-achieve-hyperconnectivity/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Oct 2022 22:31:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/helping-your-business-achieve-hyperconnectivity/</guid><description>By: John Shepler
It took a whole generation to connect the entire world to the internet. Now, get ready for an even bigger change: we&amp;rsquo;re moving towards hyperconnectivity, and it&amp;rsquo;s happening fast.
Everything, Everywhere, All at Once
Hyperconnectivity means that anything and anyone who can be connected will be connected all the time. We&amp;rsquo;ve already shifted from logging in to having always-on internet for our computers and phones. The next step is to let our devices communicate with each other without us.</description></item></channel></rss>
