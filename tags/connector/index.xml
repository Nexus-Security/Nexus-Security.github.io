As I was about to secure the hood, I discovered the system ground terminal on the rear panel was severely bent and damaged.
The damage to the threads from rust and deformation prevented the nut&amp;rsquo;s removal. I was forced to cut the bolt off. Once removed, I replaced it with a new 3mm bolt and used appropriate insulating shoulder washers.</description></item></channel></rss>
