The Forecaster database, created after installation using the Forecaster Database Creation Wizard, stores all the relevant data. During creation, a database owner is assigned, who can then manage periods within the Forecaster application itself.
Users can interact with Forecaster through either the web interface or the client application. While both offer data access, input, and reporting functionalities, the client application provides additional features for administrators.</description></item></channel></rss>
