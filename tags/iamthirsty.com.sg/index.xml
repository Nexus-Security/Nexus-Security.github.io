Since its launch in February, the platform has seen a 25% increase in its course selection. This growth is projected to accelerate significantly following the Singapore government&amp;rsquo;s announcement of the SkillsFuture initiative.
IamThirsty.com.sg boasts an impressive average user engagement time of 23 minutes, a stark contrast to its competitors, who average just 3 minutes.
