This extension was unexpected. Despite the Benn Act, which mandated the Prime Minister to request a three-month extension for EU membership if Parliament failed to approve a withdrawal agreement by October 19, the Prime Minister insisted he would rather resign than comply. Fueled by ambiguous sources within Downing Street, there was persistent speculation that the Benn Act was unconstitutional, riddled with loopholes, would be superseded by emergency powers, or violated EU law...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/life-is-full-of-challenges-and-then-you-have-to-deal-with-the-third-extension-of-eu-membership/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/life-is-full-of-challenges-and-then-you-have-to-deal-with-the-third-extension-of-eu-membership/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Revised Brexit Withdrawal Agreement: Analysis 1 Overview</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/revised-brexit-withdrawal-agreement-analysis-1-overview/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jan 2024 17:25:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/revised-brexit-withdrawal-agreement-analysis-1-overview/</guid><description>Analysis of the revised Brexit withdrawal agreement - October 2019 Professor Steve Peers, University of Essex
Introduction While the approval of the Brexit withdrawal agreement is uncertain at present, the UK Parliament&amp;rsquo;s upcoming vote necessitates an updated analysis of the revised agreement. This updated version includes a revised Protocol on the Irish border and a revised political declaration on the future relationship.
This post aims to provide a simplified explanation of the agreement for non-lawyers, outlining its structure and key content...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/revised-brexit-withdrawal-agreement-analysis-1-overview/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/revised-brexit-withdrawal-agreement-analysis-1-overview/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Speeches on the UK's future relationship with the EU by Theresa May and Boris Johnson: Lions vs. Unicorns</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/speeches-on-the-uk-s-future-relationship-with-the-eu-by-theresa-may-and-boris-johnson-lions-vs-unicorns/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jul 2023 15:04:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/speeches-on-the-uk-s-future-relationship-with-the-eu-by-theresa-may-and-boris-johnson-lions-vs-unicorns/</guid><description>Professor Steve Peers, University of Essex
Speeches delivered last week by Theresa May and Boris Johnson regarding the UK&amp;rsquo;s future relationship with the EU present a study in contrasts. May&amp;rsquo;s approach was measured and pragmatic, advocating for close ties, while Johnson&amp;rsquo;s came across as dismissive and lacking depth, favoring distance from the EU.
While the EU27 has begun drafting treaty texts for Brexit, the UK has not. To illustrate potential outcomes, this post includes draft treaties based on Johnson&amp;rsquo;s and May&amp;rsquo;s security proposals...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/speeches-on-the-uk-s-future-relationship-with-the-eu-by-theresa-may-and-boris-johnson-lions-vs-unicorns/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/speeches-on-the-uk-s-future-relationship-with-the-eu-by-theresa-may-and-boris-johnson-lions-vs-unicorns/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Divergent rulings on Parliament's suspension in England and Scotland</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/divergent-rulings-on-parliament-s-suspension-in-england-and-scotland/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2023 00:21:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/divergent-rulings-on-parliament-s-suspension-in-england-and-scotland/</guid><description>Alan S.

The A-Z of Scots Law: From Avizandum to the Zany Antics of Boris Johnson
Prime Minister Boris Johnson&amp;rsquo;s recent actions are under scrutiny by the Scottish legal system. In the Cherry case, the Scottish court deemed the decision to suspend Parliament unlawful. Further legal action is anticipated regarding the Prime Minister&amp;rsquo;s reported refusal to adhere to the European Union (Withdrawal) (No...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/divergent-rulings-on-parliament-s-suspension-in-england-and-scotland/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/divergent-rulings-on-parliament-s-suspension-in-england-and-scotland/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
