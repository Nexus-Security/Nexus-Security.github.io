The European Union (EU) has faced criticism for administrative and structural shortcomings, with reports and discussions pointing to political irregularities within its system. Similarly, concerns about alleged corruption, maladministration, and money laundering at the national governance level raise anxieties for both citizens and the Union.
On February 26, 2019, the Court of Justice (Grand Chamber) issued a significant judgment on two combined cases.</description></item><item><title>What are the legal implications of leaving the economic and monetary union according to EU law?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-are-the-legal-implications-of-leaving-the-economic-and-monetary-union-according-to-eu-law/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Apr 2023 08:27:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-are-the-legal-implications-of-leaving-the-economic-and-monetary-union-according-to-eu-law/</guid><description>Steve Peers
Greece&amp;rsquo;s upcoming referendum on accepting its creditors&amp;rsquo; offer brings uncertainty. It&amp;rsquo;s unclear if rejecting the offer means Greece automatically leaves the EU or EMU, or defaults on its debt. Accepting the offer doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide clarity either, as negotiations were ongoing during the referendum announcement, potentially making the offer outdated.
Given the range of possibilities, examining the legal framework for departing economic and monetary union (EMU) is crucial. A key question is whether Greece must leave the EU if it exits the single currency.</description></item><item><title>Is it possible for Greece to be expelled from the eurozone?

The European Central Bank&amp;rsquo;s (ECB) actions regarding Greece, particularly since Syriza&amp;rsquo;s political victory, have drawn considerable criticism. This piece examines the gradual tightening of Greece&amp;rsquo;s financial situation within the framework of ECB regulations and considers potential outcomes if a resolution for Greece&amp;rsquo;s urgent funding requirements isn&amp;rsquo;t reached by June 2015.
ECB Halts Greek Government Bonds as Collateral
Since accepting its initial bailout in 2010, Greece has largely been unable to secure funding from markets except through domestic T-Bill issuances.</description></item><item><title>Is the legality of the ECB's OMT program in question?

On January 14th, Advocate General Cruz Villalon presented his legal opinion on the Gauweiler case (C-62/14), which concerns the legality of the European Central Bank (ECB) Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) program. He believes the OMT program generally complies with EU treaties, provided certain conditions are met if it&amp;rsquo;s activated in the future. This case has significant implications for the European Monetary Union&amp;rsquo;s (EMU) constitutional framework, the ECB&amp;rsquo;s role, and the relationship between the German Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) and the Court of Justice of the EU.</description></item><item><title>Challenging the legality of ECB restrictions on Greek bank accounts – and ways you can support the cause</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/challenging-the-legality-of-ecb-restrictions-on-greek-bank-accounts-and-ways-you-can-support-the-cause/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jun 2022 07:08:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/challenging-the-legality-of-ecb-restrictions-on-greek-bank-accounts-and-ways-you-can-support-the-cause/</guid><description>Steve Peers
Many citizens across the EU have observed the plight of Greeks limited to €60 withdrawals per day with sympathy and apprehension. This situation stems from the European Central Bank (ECB) restricting emergency funds for Greek banks.
Beyond the human cost, the ECB&amp;rsquo;s actions raise serious legal, political, and economic concerns. A core function of any central bank is acting as a last-resort lender for banks, a role the ECB is demonstrably failing to fulfill in this case.</description></item></channel></rss>
