This error, lacking detailed information, occurs during the eConnect_EntryPoint call when creating a new GL account.
Two potential solutions were explored. The first, adding &amp;ldquo;Enlist=False&amp;rdquo; to the eConnect connection string, resolved the error but was identified as a workaround that disables transactions and might lead to data corruption...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/econnect-error-the-transaction-has-already-been-committed-or-aborted/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/econnect-error-the-transaction-has-already-been-committed-or-aborted/</a></p></description></item><item><title>I have learned more than I ever expected about eConnect and MSDTC.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/i-have-learned-more-than-i-ever-expected-about-econnect-and-msdtc/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jun 2022 22:57:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/i-have-learned-more-than-i-ever-expected-about-econnect-and-msdtc/</guid><description>In a previous post, I talked about an eConnect error that said &amp;ldquo;The transaction has already been implicitly or explicitly committed or aborted.&amp;rdquo;
I discovered that adding the parameter &amp;ldquo;Enlist=False&amp;rdquo; to the eConnect transaction string could sometimes resolve the error. However, this fix wasn&amp;rsquo;t ideal as it could lead to incomplete transaction processing. Another potential solution was changing the MSDTC Transaction Manager Communication security setting to &amp;ldquo;No Authentication Required.&amp;rdquo; Lastly, firewall or network configuration issues were also identified as potential culprits...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/i-have-learned-more-than-i-ever-expected-about-econnect-and-msdtc/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/i-have-learned-more-than-i-ever-expected-about-econnect-and-msdtc/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
