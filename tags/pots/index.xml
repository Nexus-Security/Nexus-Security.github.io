Every business, regardless of size, requires at least one telephone line. While phone lines may seem straightforward, you might have more choices than you realize. Are you confident that your business has the most suitable phone line?
Plain Old Telephone Service
The traditional analog phone line, known as POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service), is a basic and familiar option.
POTS lines are simple, consisting of a single twisted copper pair connecting a standard RJ-11 phone jack on your wall directly to the telephone company&amp;rsquo;s central office.</description></item><item><title>Circuit Switched vs Packet Switched Networks</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/circuit-switched-vs-packet-switched-networks/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 May 2024 06:21:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/circuit-switched-vs-packet-switched-networks/</guid><description>By: John Shepler
Over the past few decades, two primary network technologies have been vying for dominance. The first is the traditional telephone system, which served us well throughout the industrial age. The second is the computer-based architecture that has driven the information age. You might recognize these as circuit switching and packet switching.
While both technologies will likely coexist for a while longer, we are at a turning point. From now on, packet switching will be the dominant force in every network, from copper lines to fiber optic cables to wireless connections.</description></item><item><title>What Replaces DSL, T1, ISDN PRI, EoC?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-replaces-dsl-t1-isdn-pri-eoc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Apr 2024 00:50:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-replaces-dsl-t1-isdn-pri-eoc/</guid><description>By: John Shepler
