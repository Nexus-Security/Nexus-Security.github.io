Retaining customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones, and positive customer experiences lead to organic promotion. Conversely, unhappy customers can significantly damage a company&amp;rsquo;s reputation, especially in today&amp;rsquo;s age of social media.
Prioritizing excellent customer service brings rewards, while neglecting it leads to negative consequences. Implementing an efficient and user-friendly system that integrates modern communication channels like social media with traditional methods such as email and phone support is key.</description></item></channel></rss>
