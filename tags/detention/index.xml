The Amsterdam District Court, solely responsible for handling European Arrest Warrants (EAWs) in the Netherlands, faces a conflict between national and EU laws regarding detention and release. Dutch law mandates the release of a requested individual after 90 days if the court hasn&amp;rsquo;t made a decision on the EAW. However, a 2015 European Court of Justice (CJEU) ruling stated that national courts can extend detention beyond 90 days to ensure conditions for surrender are met...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-european-arrest-warrant-compatible-with-human-rights-can-individuals-be-legally-detained-for-more-than-90-days-before-being-surrendered/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-european-arrest-warrant-compatible-with-human-rights-can-individuals-be-legally-detained-for-more-than-90-days-before-being-surrendered/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Is the EU's Returns Directive beneficial or detrimental to the well-being of undocumented migrants?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-eu-s-returns-directive-beneficial-or-detrimental-to-the-well-being-of-undocumented-migrants/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 20:30:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-eu-s-returns-directive-beneficial-or-detrimental-to-the-well-being-of-undocumented-migrants/</guid><description>A Closer Look at the EU Returns Directive: Five Years On Many EU citizens are worried about the impact of immigration, especially when it comes to unauthorized migrants without legal status.

Since its rushed creation after the 9/11 attacks, the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) has become a cornerstone of EU criminal law. It replaces traditional extradition with a streamlined system lacking most of the usual limitations. This has worried critics concerned about potential miscarriages of justice but pleased supporters who appreciate the faster return of more fugitives to face justice.
Despite concerns from some EU countries&amp;rsquo; constitutional courts, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has long dismissed human rights criticisms of the EAW...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/has-the-european-court-of-justice-shifted-from-being-an-offender-to-a-protector-of-human-rights-in-the-context-of-the-european-arrest-warrant/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/has-the-european-court-of-justice-shifted-from-being-an-offender-to-a-protector-of-human-rights-in-the-context-of-the-european-arrest-warrant/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Finally free?

The recent Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decision in the Lanigan case, which deals with prolonged pre-trial detention and the European Arrest Warrant (EAW), is especially noteworthy given the UN&amp;rsquo;s recent statement regarding Julian Assange&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;arbitrary detention.&amp;rdquo; Assange, who is also facing an EAW, presents a unique situation.

The detention of those seeking asylum is a contentious issue within immigration law. While not initially covered by the European Common Asylum System (CEAS), it is now addressed in several of the second-phase CEAS measures.

Introduction
The recent judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in the case of DK (C-653/19 PPU, 28 November 2019) has validated two concerning observations about the state of European criminal law. Firstly, Directive 2016/343 on the presumption of innocence has limited practical application, particularly regarding pre-trial detention. Secondly, pre-trial detention is a contentious subject, with both the CJEU and the EU legislator hesitant to establish common standards despite their absence negatively impacting mutual trust between Member States&amp;rsquo; judicial systems...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/pilate-cleanses-his-hands-the-cjeu-s-stance-on-pre-trial-detention/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/pilate-cleanses-his-hands-the-cjeu-s-stance-on-pre-trial-detention/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Europe's Immigration Detention: Uncovering the Truth - A Recent Study by the European Migration Network</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/europe-s-immigration-detention-uncovering-the-truth-a-recent-study-by-the-european-migration-network/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Feb 2024 02:13:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/europe-s-immigration-detention-uncovering-the-truth-a-recent-study-by-the-european-migration-network/</guid><description>Izabella Majcher, Associate Researcher at Global Detention Project and PhD candidate in International Law at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies is Geneva.

In early February 2014, the Commission released a concerning report regarding &amp;ldquo;common rules on detention.&amp;rdquo; The report revealed that a mere 18 out of 28 EU member states had implemented any of the intended instruments. This study was purely quantitative and did not assess the effectiveness of the rules or their impact on individuals.

A recent ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) addressed the conflict between EU and national laws regarding detention periods for individuals subject to a European Arrest Warrant (EAW).
