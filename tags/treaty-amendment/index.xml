Experts in EU law see Treaty amendments as a monumental event. After the Treaty of Lisbon, significant changes to the Treaty seemed improbable in the near future. However, this prospect is becoming more likely due to David Cameron&amp;rsquo;s push to renegotiate free movement regulations within the EU, a sentiment somewhat shared by the UK Labour party.
This brings us to the crucial question of what form such a Treaty amendment would take...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-possible-for-a-fast-track-treaty-amendment-on-the-free-movement-of-workers-with-the-cameron-express/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-possible-for-a-fast-track-treaty-amendment-on-the-free-movement-of-workers-with-the-cameron-express/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Should safeguarding the rule of law in the EU be the responsibility of the Commission?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/should-safeguarding-the-rule-of-law-in-the-eu-be-the-responsibility-of-the-commission/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jun 2023 21:22:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/should-safeguarding-the-rule-of-law-in-the-eu-be-the-responsibility-of-the-commission/</guid><description>Steve Peers
Concerns about upholding the rule of law within the European Union have arisen lately, particularly regarding government actions in Hungary and Romania. Currently, the EU can address breaches of EU law and penalize severe, ongoing violations of EU values, including rule of law. However, there&amp;rsquo;s no mechanism to handle potential EU value breaches not directly tied to EU law or not reaching the threshold of a serious persistent breach...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/should-safeguarding-the-rule-of-law-in-the-eu-be-the-responsibility-of-the-commission/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/should-safeguarding-the-rule-of-law-in-the-eu-be-the-responsibility-of-the-commission/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Is the European Union a cause worth sacrificing for?

This strong desire for EU membership among some Ukrainians raises important questions about the EU&amp;rsquo;s future.
The first steps after the planned elections would be straightforward. A pro-European government would likely ratify the association agreement, which connects Ukraine to EU law more closely than previous agreements...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-european-union-a-cause-worth-sacrificing-for-contemplating-the-future-of-ukraine-and-the-eu/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-european-union-a-cause-worth-sacrificing-for-contemplating-the-future-of-ukraine-and-the-eu/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Is it possible for Thomas Piketty to bring about reform in both capitalism and democracy within the European Union?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-possible-for-thomas-piketty-to-bring-about-reform-in-both-capitalism-and-democracy-within-the-european-union/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Sep 2022 02:08:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-possible-for-thomas-piketty-to-bring-about-reform-in-both-capitalism-and-democracy-within-the-european-union/</guid><description>Steve Peers
French economist Thomas Piketty unexpectedly became a prominent intellectual figure, especially in the UK and US, with his book &amp;ldquo;Capital,&amp;rdquo; which presents a new perspective on the relationship between capitalism and democracy.
Maintaining his engagement with current issues, Piketty has contributed to a proposal for EU reform, connecting his academic work to practical solutions.

In April 2019, the European Commission initiated a discussion on streamlining the EU&amp;rsquo;s decision-making in social policy. The goal was to enhance efficiency by utilizing &amp;ldquo;passerelle&amp;rdquo; clauses, which permit a shift from unanimous voting to qualified majority voting (QMV) and from special to ordinary legislative procedures. This change, while requiring unanimous approval from Member States, aims to bypass the complexities of Treaty revisions...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/should-there-be-increased-use-of-majority-voting-in-eu-social-policy-decisions-evaluating-the-commission-s-suggestion/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/should-there-be-increased-use-of-majority-voting-in-eu-social-policy-decisions-evaluating-the-commission-s-suggestion/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
