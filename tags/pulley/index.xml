The turntable is in excellent cosmetic condition, requiring only cleaning. Even the keypad is in good shape, though using a 4002 Commander remote control could help prevent future wear.
The veneer corners are flawless, and the internal components appear untouched.
Initial testing showed the turntable powers on and the motor functions, but the arm doesn&amp;rsquo;t lower.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: A New Arrival from Germany En Route to California</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-a-new-arrival-from-germany-en-route-to-california/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2024 16:42:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-a-new-arrival-from-germany-en-route-to-california/</guid><description>I recently acquired a Beogram 4000 turntable from Germany, intended for a customer in California.

The packaging was excellent, using the original styrofoam inserts, and the only issue was two loose control pads, which were prevented from causing damage due to tape and foam inside. This highlights the importance of securing these pads with non-residue tape during shipping.
Fortunately, this is an easy repair. Cosmetically, the Beogram is in excellent condition.
The aluminum panels will gleam like new with a thorough cleaning.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Adjusting the Gap at the Carriage Servo Pulley Bearing</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-adjusting-the-gap-at-the-carriage-servo-pulley-bearing/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Mar 2024 17:11:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-adjusting-the-gap-at-the-carriage-servo-pulley-bearing/</guid><description>During the restoration of a Beogram 4000 turntable, significant longitudinal play was discovered in the threaded rod responsible for moving the carriage. This play resulted in a &amp;lsquo;clacking&amp;rsquo; noise whenever the carriage changed direction.
The issue was resolved by removing the servo pulley, damaged locking ring, and worn plastic washer. A new, thick 2-56 nylon washer, which fit snugly on the shaft, replaced the locking ring and washer. The locking ring became unnecessary as the pulley was secured with a setscrew.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: A New Arrival From Germany - A First Peek</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-a-new-arrival-from-germany-a-first-peek/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Mar 2024 21:25:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-a-new-arrival-from-germany-a-first-peek/</guid><description>A Beogram 4000 turntable arrived from Germany for restoration, packaged securely with double boxes and separate protection for the platter.
The inner box housed the Beogram within a styrofoam liner, while the two accompanying cartridges, an MMC20 E and an MMC20 EN, were packaged together. Unfortunately, the cartridges shifted during transit, causing the cantilever of the EN to press against the E cartridge&amp;rsquo;s plastic shroud. Thankfully, upon careful inspection, it appears that both cantilevers remain undamaged.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 Type 5513: Fit and Finish Rework</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-fit-and-finish-rework/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2024 03:10:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-fit-and-finish-rework/</guid><description>Restoring Beogram 4002 turntables is a fulfilling endeavor, though it often necessitates revisiting steps multiple times. Despite getting this particular Beogram functioning properly, I was dissatisfied with the fit of some components.
The tonearm cover wasn&amp;rsquo;t sitting flush, as evidenced by its crooked appearance in the photo, with the center divider visibly off-center between the fixed arm and tonearm.
A head-on perspective further highlights this issue, along with the misaligned deck trim, showing an undesirably wide gap between the panels.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: A Very Corroded New Arrival from Sweden</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-a-very-corroded-new-arrival-from-sweden/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jan 2024 01:23:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-a-very-corroded-new-arrival-from-sweden/</guid><description>My initial assessment of the Beogram 4000 from Sweden is a mixed bag. Positively, the aluminum surfaces, platter, arm cover lettering, and panels are in good shape, though a thorough cleaning is needed to determine their true condition. The internal components appear original, and the red position indicator is intact. However, there are significant drawbacks.
The black enclosure parts have an unprecedented amount of corrosion, exceeding typical wear and tear. This corrosion is present even on the underside and has also affected the chassis&amp;rsquo;s leaf springs.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): New Arrival from Arizona - A First Look</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-new-arrival-from-arizona-a-first-look/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2024 21:48:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-new-arrival-from-arizona-a-first-look/</guid><description>I recently received a Beogram 4002 (Type 5513) from Arizona.

The final piece I needed was a new aluminum pulley for the carriage servo. The original pulley was cracked and causing unwanted noise and vibration, particularly during rapid carriage movements like starting and stopping. This was not acceptable for a quality turntable.
A standard replacement pulley wasn&amp;rsquo;t compatible with this early 5501 model. These early models use a unique end groove detection system requiring a pulley with four holes that function as an optical chopper to monitor the carriage speed.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 Type 5513: Progress Update</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-progress-update/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Aug 2023 08:28:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-progress-update/</guid><description>The next stage of the restoration involved removing parts from the Beogram chassis.

To fix this, I carefully removed the old rubber with a small drill bit by hand, avoiding any damage to the plexiglass.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: A New Arrival from the UK</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-a-new-arrival-from-the-uk/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Oct 2022 01:09:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-a-new-arrival-from-the-uk/</guid><description>A Beogram 4000 turntable recently arrived from a UK seller for restoration. This report outlines its pre-restoration condition.
Upon arrival, the unit was quite dirty but in good overall shape. The dust cover showed typical scratches from storage, many deep enough to feel with a fingernail. However, it can be polished back to good condition. Positively, the dust cover features an aluminum strip instead of the less durable plastic type, and the hinges appear to be intact.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: A New Arrival From Michigan - A First Look</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-a-new-arrival-from-michigan-a-first-look/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Sep 2022 20:59:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-a-new-arrival-from-michigan-a-first-look/</guid><description>A Beogram 4000 turntable arrived from Michigan for restoration, carefully packaged according to instructions. The aluminum surfaces are in good condition, with one minor dent on the platter&amp;rsquo;s surrounding plate. The platter itself, keypads, and small aluminum plate are also in good shape. However, one corner of the plinth is damaged. Fortunately, replacement plinth panels were included, which will be installed.
The hood has noticeable scratches, primarily on the surface, and should polish well.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5523): A New Arrival - A First Look</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5523-a-new-arrival-a-first-look/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Aug 2022 11:39:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5523-a-new-arrival-a-first-look/</guid><description>A Beogram 4002 (5523) turntable arrived in need of repair. The packaging was generally good, but the cartridge was not secured properly for transport. Thankfully, the delicate cantilever was undamaged. The first step was to safely store the cartridge in a specialized MMC cartridge box. These boxes are offered to customers who are shipping their Beograms for restoration and are also available for the MMC1-5 cartridges.
An initial assessment showed that the aluminum panels were in good condition.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5503): A New Arrival - First Impressions</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5503-a-new-arrival-first-impressions/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jul 2022 16:29:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5503-a-new-arrival-first-impressions/</guid><description>I recently acquired a Beogram 4002 (5503) for restoration. The 5503 is the North American version of the 5501/5502 models, evident in the non-functional voltage switch included to maintain a consistent appearance.
This Beogram is in excellent overall condition, featuring high-quality veneer on the plinth and a dust cover with typical scratches that can be polished to near-original clarity. Internally, it appears largely untouched, though there are indications of prior work, such as loose bolts in the tracking and tonearm mechanisms.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 DC Motor Restoration: Oil Infusion of the Bearings and a Shiny New Pulley from Austria</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-dc-motor-restoration-oil-infusion-of-the-bearings-and-a-shiny-new-pulley-from-austria/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jun 2022 21:53:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-dc-motor-restoration-oil-infusion-of-the-bearings-and-a-shiny-new-pulley-from-austria/</guid><description>Another Beogram 4002 DC platter motor in need of repair came to my workshop from Virginia. Here&amp;rsquo;s a picture of the motor:
The motor&amp;rsquo;s pulley was unusually worn, with a groove where the raised center, designed to keep the belt aligned, should be:
It barely functioned during the initial test. To address this, I disassembled it to lubricate the bearings:
The bearings are the two small rings on the black surface.</description></item></channel></rss>
