In the past, I grew a large quantity of garlic and ran a home-based business selling my own brand of garlic powder. I even wrote and published a book on the subject.
These days, my garlic production is limited to a single garden bed. After harvesting the bulbs, I leave the still-green plants to dry under my wood shed. Once they&amp;rsquo;re dry, I use a bandsaw to remove the roots and upper stem, as shown in the photo above.</description></item></channel></rss>
