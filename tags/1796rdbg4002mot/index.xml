Evidence suggested prior repair attempts on the motor, including scratches on the bearing assembly and damaged brushes.
Upon disassembly, it was clear the bearings hadn&amp;rsquo;t been properly oiled. A vacuum oil infusion process was conducted on both the top and bottom bearings. After cleaning and reassembly, a short circuit was detected, pointing to faulty spark snubbers.
The old spark snubbers were replaced with modern TVS devices.</description></item></channel></rss>
