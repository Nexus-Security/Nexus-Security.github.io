A UK exit from the European Union, or &amp;ldquo;Brexit,&amp;rdquo; could have significant implications for young people, impacting their education, travel opportunities, and economic prospects.

Established in 1987, this EU law-based program facilitates student exchanges across various educational levels.</description></item></channel></rss>
