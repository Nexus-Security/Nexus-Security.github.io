This post covers the last board requiring capacitor replacements: the Tone Control &amp;amp; FM Tuning Board. Replacing the ten capacitors on this board is straightforward due to their accessibility. The true challenge lies in cleaning and fixing the three slider controls: Bass, Treble, and Balance.

I began by replacing the electrolytic capacitors. As I&amp;rsquo;ve noted before, these Beocord 9000 units often require minimal recapping, if any. This particular unit seems to have been stored for a considerable period, and I already discovered one faulty capacitor, prompting me to replace the others.
My usual practice is to use audio-grade capacitors in the signal path and opt for high-reliability, 105°C rated, long-lasting capacitors elsewhere.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 Type 5513: Main Board Rework and Start of Speed Test #3</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-main-board-rework-and-start-of-speed-test-3/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Nov 2023 06:25:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-main-board-rework-and-start-of-speed-test-3/</guid><description>I visited Mouser to acquire some components for my Beogram project. However, upon commencing work on the main board, I realized I lacked a couple of 5KΩ multi-turn trimmers, essential for the 45 RPM and 33 1/3 RPM speed control (labeled 1R14 and 1R15). While I could order the parts, delivery wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be possible until Monday, and I was eager to keep the project moving.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a photo of the Beogram&amp;rsquo;s main board before removal:</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): Electrical Work and Initial Tracking Adjustment</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-electrical-work-and-initial-tracking-adjustment/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Sep 2023 15:12:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-electrical-work-and-initial-tracking-adjustment/</guid><description>Let&amp;rsquo;s begin restoring the electronic boards. The main control board needs its capacitors replaced and the RPM relay (along with the RPM trimmers) need attention. Additionally, the output board requires inspection of its phono muting circuit. It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that aside from wiring, the muting relay is the sole electrical part interacting with the phono audio signal. The turntable&amp;rsquo;s electronics mainly manage the platter motor, tangential arm, indicator lamps, and user controls, none of which are part of the audio pathway.</description></item><item><title>Beocord 5000 (4715/4716): Recapping the Preamplifier and the Radio Amplifier Boards</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-5000-47154716-recapping-the-preamplifier-and-the-radio-amplifier-boards/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jun 2023 01:47:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-5000-47154716-recapping-the-preamplifier-and-the-radio-amplifier-boards/</guid><description>Let&amp;rsquo;s review the Beocord 5000! This model contains many tantalum capacitors that, due to their age (around 35 years), should be replaced. Tantalum capacitors pose a fire risk if they short circuit because of the intense heat released when tantalum reacts with oxygen. While tantalum capacitors were favored in the 1970s due to their smaller size compared to aluminum electrolytic capacitors, advancements in manufacturing have closed the size gap. Today, modern aluminum capacitors can be just as small as the older tantalum ones.</description></item><item><title>Beocord 5000 (4715/4716): Recapping the Power Supply, Motor Control, Electronic Switch and Operational Control Boards</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-5000-47154716-recapping-the-power-supply-motor-control-electronic-switch-and-operational-control-boards/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 May 2023 05:02:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-5000-47154716-recapping-the-power-supply-motor-control-electronic-switch-and-operational-control-boards/</guid><description>The restoration continues! Today, I replaced the remaining electrolytic capacitors on my Beocord 5000 (4715/4716). New electrolytics bring peace of mind!
The power supply board, including its reservoir and AC motor capacitors, along with the motor control, electronic switch, and operational control boards, were all addressed:
The Motor Control board, responsible for the take-up motor, had only one Tantalum capacitor that needed replacement:
Here it is after the replacement:
Next is the Electronic Switch board.</description></item><item><title> Beomaster 8000: Display Board Rebuilt</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/-beomaster-8000-display-board-rebuilt/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Mar 2023 13:53:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/-beomaster-8000-display-board-rebuilt/</guid><description>After rigorous testing, the refurbished Beomaster 8000 display modules are ready for installation. This final stage of the restoration involves replacing several components on the display board: the four display modules, incandescent bulbs, a 10uF electrolytic capacitor, and a 4.7uF tantalum capacitor. The incandescent bulbs will be replaced with Beolover&amp;rsquo;s LED replacements, eliminating the need for four 220Ω resistors. As part of the restoration process, all board connectors will be reflowed.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 Type 5513: Recapping the main controller board and the output board</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-recapping-the-main-controller-board-and-the-output-board/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Feb 2023 08:42:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-recapping-the-main-controller-board-and-the-output-board/</guid><description>The main controller and output boards have had their capacitors successfully replaced.
In addition to replacing the electrolytic and tantalum capacitors on the main controller board, the RPM selection relay and both RPM adjustment trimmers were also replaced.

This image highlights two components within the main controller board&amp;rsquo;s record detection circuit that might require further attention and modification. A determination on whether these components need changing will be made after evaluating all the Beogram 4002 photo sensors.</description></item><item><title>A Pair of Beomaster 1900 Receivers for Restoration: Recapping the Main Board and Volume Control Board (Unit #1)</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-pair-of-beomaster-1900-receivers-for-restoration-recapping-the-main-board-and-volume-control-board-unit-1-/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Nov 2022 09:43:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-pair-of-beomaster-1900-receivers-for-restoration-recapping-the-main-board-and-volume-control-board-unit-1-/</guid><description>The main board and volume control board restoration is finished.
Despite the Beomaster 1900 and 2400 receivers having a small footprint, their restoration is deceptively complex. Replacing the numerous capacitors always serves as a reminder of the intricate internal workings.
Upon arrival, the main board appeared as shown:
After replacing the electrolytic and tantalum capacitors, the main board looked like this:
Here&amp;rsquo;s a closer look:
Following my usual practice, I replaced electrolytic and tantalum capacitors with values of 4.</description></item><item><title>Beocord 9000: Replacing Capacitors Wrapped Up</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-replacing-capacitors-wrapped-up/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Aug 2022 16:07:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-replacing-capacitors-wrapped-up/</guid><description>The capacitor replacement on the Beocord 9000 cassette deck is complete, although it took a bit longer than anticipated. While most capacitors were within specification, a few were not, including two that had completely failed. Notably, a 220uF capacitor (C56) on the Microcomputer/Display board was the culprit behind the Beocord&amp;rsquo;s inability to power on. Another failed 220uF capacitor (C7) of the same brand was discovered on the Dolby board. This highlights the importance of checking all electrolytic capacitors in such situations.</description></item><item><title> Beomaster 8000: Microcomputer Board Reworked</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/-beomaster-8000-microcomputer-board-reworked/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jul 2022 09:08:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/-beomaster-8000-microcomputer-board-reworked/</guid><description>I worked on the Beomaster 8000 microcomputer board today. This Beomaster is an earlier model and uses a first-generation microcomputer board, unlike later models with directly replaceable, yet distinct, boards. I&amp;rsquo;ll show an example of a later model board at the end.
One issue with the first-generation boards is the metal enclosure surrounding the processor ICs. While necessary for shielding, it makes accessing components difficult. B&amp;amp;O used soldered metal tabs to connect the upper and lower sections, but these tabs are soldered to the board&amp;rsquo;s ground plane, requiring significant heat for removal.</description></item></channel></rss>
