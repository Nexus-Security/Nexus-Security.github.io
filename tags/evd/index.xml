They emphasized that nations with strong health systems are unlikely to experience an epidemic. This is due to the way the virus spreads and past experiences with outbreaks.
The WHO also noted that while fear has led to increased global vigilance and suspicion of the virus, this heightened awareness makes it more likely that cases will be detected and managed quickly, thus limiting further transmission.</description></item></channel></rss>
