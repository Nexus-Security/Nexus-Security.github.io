Source: Singdaptive. With Exchangely, students can submit recordings to Singdaptive&amp;rsquo;s instructors for feedback at a later time, rather than receiving live, immediate feedback.
Exchangely allows singers and Singdaptive vocal coaches to exchange videos, enabling instructors to offer personalized feedback, exercises, and assignments tailored to each singerâ€™s objectives. This method empowers singers to learn at their preferred pace within a platform that connects them with Singdaptive&amp;rsquo;s team, provides quizzes, and monitors their advancement.</description></item></channel></rss>
