Back in 2009, I purchased a hops plant from Territorial Seed Company and planted it in my garden. To support its growth, I used a 12-foot tall T-post pole, following instructions from my gardening guide. The plant has been incredibly resilient.
Initially, it produced numerous large cones, but their size decreased over time. Last year, the yield was quite low. Upon mentioning this to a fellow hops enthusiast and beer brewer at the lumberyard, I learned that pruning the vines to just three or four per pole would improve cone size.</description></item></channel></rss>
