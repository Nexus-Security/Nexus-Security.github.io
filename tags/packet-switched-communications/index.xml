This point-to-point system limited network sharing capabilities.
However, packet-switched communications revolutionized this process. Now, constant connections link all locations, while data packets travel across various network pathways. This interconnected network is often visualized as a &amp;ldquo;cloud,&amp;rdquo; where data magically reaches its intended destination. This cloud-based system enables many-to-many communications, contrasting with the previous one-to-one limitation. A prime example is connecting multiple business branches, allowing seamless communication between them without manual intervention.</description></item></channel></rss>
