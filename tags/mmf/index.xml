This comprehensive analysis, &amp;ldquo;Counterfeit/Substandard Mobile Phones - A Resource Guide for Governments&amp;rdquo;, examines the prevalence of these phones across all major brands.
According to MMF Secretary General Michael Milligan, research suggests approximately 148 million counterfeit or substandard cell phones were sold in 2013 alone, primarily through established retail channels.</description></item></channel></rss>
