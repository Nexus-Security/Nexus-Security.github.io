Smaller businesses often rely on slower T1 lines (1.5 Mbps), while larger corporations enjoy significantly faster speeds (100-1000 times faster) through fiber optic connections.
However, technologies like Ethernet over Copper (EoC) and Ethernet over TDM (EoTDM) are bridging this gap by enabling a broader range of bandwidths on existing copper infrastructure. This allows for a smoother transition between T1 speeds and gigabit or even higher speeds...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/eoc-and-eotdm-complement-fiber/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/eoc-and-eotdm-complement-fiber/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
