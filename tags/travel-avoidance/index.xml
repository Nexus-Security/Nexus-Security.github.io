The idea itself is appealing: consider the expenses of travel combined with the value of time spent commuting to and from the meeting location, multiplied by the number of attendees.

When you realize the actual cost, it becomes hard to justify having in-person business meetings unless absolutely necessary, especially when an electronic alternative exists that can eliminate the inefficiencies and leave you with only the cost of the meeting content.</description></item></channel></rss>
