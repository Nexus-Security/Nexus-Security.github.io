On December 15, 2015, the European Commission put forward a suggestion for a program to offer humanitarian entry to Syrian refugees residing in Turkey. This proposal follows earlier EU initiatives, including a plan to relocate refugees within the EU and a program for resettling refugees from other countries. It also builds upon an action plan from October 2015 and a more recent decision to give â‚¬3 billion to a Refugee Facility designed to better coordinate aid for Syrian refugees in Turkey.</description></item></channel></rss>
