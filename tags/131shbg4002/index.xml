The Oilite brass bearings, designed with a &amp;rsquo;lifetime&amp;rsquo; lubricant within their pores, typically need replenishing after approximately four decades. This involves submerging the bearings in motor oil and using a vacuum to extract air from the pores, allowing oil to penetrate. A detailed video demonstrating this process is available here.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a glimpse at this specific motor, both extracted from the turntable:..<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5524-infusing-the-dc-motor-oilite-bearings-with-fresh-oil/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5524-infusing-the-dc-motor-oilite-bearings-with-fresh-oil/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5524): Too Early Arm Lowering and RPM Change During START</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5524-too-early-arm-lowering-and-rpm-change-during-start/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Aug 2023 14:54:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5524-too-early-arm-lowering-and-rpm-change-during-start/</guid><description>The Beogram 4002 (5524) turntables I&amp;rsquo;ve been repairing had a recurring issue: during the start-up sequence, the arm wouldn&amp;rsquo;t consistently lower at the 30 cm mark. Occasionally, the RPM would unexpectedly switch to 45 right after pressing start.
Troubleshooting was challenging because the problem was intermittent. I replaced all the electrolytic capacitors, the RPM relay, and trimmers, as detailed on my blog. To test, I installed the boards in my own Beogram 4002 (5513)...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5524-too-early-arm-lowering-and-rpm-change-during-start/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5524-too-early-arm-lowering-and-rpm-change-during-start/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5524): Rebuilding the Main and Output PCBs</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5524-rebuilding-the-main-and-output-pcbs/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jul 2023 11:24:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5524-rebuilding-the-main-and-output-pcbs/</guid><description>I recently got the main circuit board, output circuit board, and DC motor from a Beogram 4002 (5524) turntable. A customer in the UK sent them to me to fix because the platter&amp;rsquo;s RPM wasn&amp;rsquo;t consistent and the arm wouldn&amp;rsquo;t lower to the correct position when starting.
My usual process for these is to replace the electrolytic capacitors, install a new relay, and swap the single-turn RPM adjustment knobs with 25-turn ones for more precise control...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5524-rebuilding-the-main-and-output-pcbs/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5524-rebuilding-the-main-and-output-pcbs/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
