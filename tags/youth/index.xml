The survey indicates that young Arabs believe governments could do more to support them, such as promoting affordable lending, enhancing training and education opportunities, and reducing bureaucratic hurdles.
When asked if their generation is more likely to start businesses than previous ones, 54% agreed. GCC youth were the most optimistic at 62%, compared to 54% in North Africa and 44% in the Levant.</description></item></channel></rss>
