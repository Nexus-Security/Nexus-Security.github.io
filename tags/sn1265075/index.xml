This turntable had also visited in 2020 for a broken tonearm cartridge mount.
During both prior repairs, the owner opted to retain some original, functioning components, including the sensor lamp, tracking sensor lamp, and output phono muting switch. Since the sensor lamp has now burned out, it will be replaced with a modern Beolover LED assembly.</description></item></channel></rss>
