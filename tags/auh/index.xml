This applies when traveling to Suvarnabhumi Airport during the curfew, which is in effect from 10:00 PM to 5:00 AM local time. The airline advises, &amp;ldquo;Guests are advised to allow extra time to reach the airport.&amp;rdquo;
Due to the suspension of public transportation starting at 9:00 PM local time and possible limited taxi services, Etihad suggests that hotel guests consider booking airport limousine services through their hotels.</description></item></channel></rss>
