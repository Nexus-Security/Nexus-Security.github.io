Background
Bratislava was chosen by the Council to host the headquarters of the newly established European Labour Authority (ELA). Initially proposed by President Juncker in 2017, the ELA&amp;rsquo;s primary goal is to simplify and enhance the fairness of EU labor mobility within the internal market. This initiative stemmed from the European Pillar of Social Rights (EPSR) and was introduced alongside other measures aimed at promoting social fairness within the EU.</description></item></channel></rss>
