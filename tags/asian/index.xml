Kitaab, meaning &amp;ldquo;book&amp;rdquo; in many Asian languages, is entering a new stage: crowdfunding on Indiegogo. Established in 2005, this literary initiative aims to empower Asian writers and connect them with a global audience.

&amp;ldquo;The Oxford Handbook of Asian Business Systems&amp;rdquo;, edited by Michael Witt and Gordon Redding, is the first publication to examine business systems from India to Japan.
Oxford University Press, the book&amp;rsquo;s publisher, states that existing research on &amp;ldquo;varieties of capitalism&amp;rdquo; (VOC) and &amp;ldquo;comparative business systems&amp;rdquo; heavily emphasizes Europe, Japan, and Anglo-Saxon countries. This book is the first to offer a thorough analysis of the institutional frameworks of most Asian countries and assess the applicability of current theories within the Asian context.</description></item></channel></rss>
