The Spur aims to make heart rate zone training accessible to everyone, not just athletes, by offering a user-friendly alternative to chest straps.
For years, fitness enthusiasts and athletes have used heart rate as a measure of workout intensity. A higher heart rate generally indicates a more intense workout.
The Spur uses a wrist-based sensor to measure resting heart rate and track different heart rate zones: Warm Up, Fat Burning, Cardio, Intense, and Maximum.</description></item><item><title>Improving heart health with cranberry juice</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/improving-heart-health-with-cranberry-juice/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jun 2022 16:28:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/improving-heart-health-with-cranberry-juice/</guid><description>Drinking cranberry juice every day could potentially lead to healthier blood sugar and cholesterol levels, according to recent research.
In a study involving overweight but otherwise healthy participants, those who drank two glasses (450ml) of a cranberry-based beverage daily for two weeks showed improvements in blood sugar stability, reducing spikes and dips often associated with cravings and fatigue. These benefits continued when the two-glass intake was maintained.
After eight weeks of daily consumption, the same cranberry beverage was also linked to higher levels of &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; HDL cholesterol, known for promoting artery health by removing &amp;ldquo;bad&amp;rdquo; cholesterol.</description></item></channel></rss>
