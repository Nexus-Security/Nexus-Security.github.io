Their latest product, Eye-Fi Explore, automatically adds geotags to photos as you take them.
You might be surprised to learn that they haven&amp;rsquo;t actually included a GPS receiver in the small SD card. Instead, it uses a system that determines location based on known WiFi hotspots. This method covers a significant portion of the U.S. population and major metropolitan areas in Europe.</description></item></channel></rss>
