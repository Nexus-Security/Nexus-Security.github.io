The UK&amp;rsquo;s exit from the European Union (EU) did not affect its participation in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). However, the relationship between human rights and EU law has changed for the UK. This blog post will explore the new connections between human rights and the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) now in effect between the EU and the UK...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/analysis-3-the-impact-of-human-rights-on-the-eu-uk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-in-brexit/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/analysis-3-the-impact-of-human-rights-on-the-eu-uk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-in-brexit/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Analysis 2: An Overview of the EU/UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement on Brexit</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/analysis-2-an-overview-of-the-eu-uk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-on-brexit/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Nov 2023 07:32:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/analysis-2-an-overview-of-the-eu-uk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-on-brexit/</guid><description>A Summary and Overview of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement Introduction
Starting January 1, 2021, the UK-EU relationship transitioned from the Brexit withdrawal agreement to a new framework. This new framework relies partly on the existing withdrawal agreement and partly on the newly established Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA). Itâ€™s important to note that two additional agreements, concerning security information and Euratom, were also established.
This piece provides a summary of the TCA, drawing from initial observations...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/analysis-2-an-overview-of-the-eu-uk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-on-brexit/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/analysis-2-an-overview-of-the-eu-uk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-on-brexit/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Analysis 4 of the Brexit agreement: Examination of dispute resolution and the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and UK.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/analysis-4-of-the-brexit-agreement-examination-of-dispute-resolution-and-the-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-between-the-eu-and-uk/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jun 2023 13:20:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/analysis-4-of-the-brexit-agreement-examination-of-dispute-resolution-and-the-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-between-the-eu-and-uk/</guid><description>Professor Steve Peers, University of Essex
Introduction and Overview
A crucial element of the &amp;lsquo;Brexit deal&amp;rsquo;, formally called the EU/UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA), is dispute resolution. This post provides a thorough analysis of the treaty&amp;rsquo;s dispute resolution mechanisms and offers a concise summary upfront. (An update on April 29, 2021, incorporates the final TCA article numbers).
This is the fourth post in a series examining the TCA. It follows an overview of the TCA, an analysis of its social security provisions by Professor Tamara Hervey, and an exploration of the connections between the TCA and human rights...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/analysis-4-of-the-brexit-agreement-examination-of-dispute-resolution-and-the-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-between-the-eu-and-uk/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/analysis-4-of-the-brexit-agreement-examination-of-dispute-resolution-and-the-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-between-the-eu-and-uk/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Analysis 1: Examination of Healthcare Entitlements in the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/analysis-1-examination-of-healthcare-entitlements-in-the-eu-uk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Mar 2023 17:19:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/analysis-1-examination-of-healthcare-entitlements-in-the-eu-uk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement/</guid><description>Professor Tamara Hervey from the University of Sheffield examines the healthcare entitlements, if any, provided by the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) that was provisionally agreed upon on December 24, 2020.
Introduction
The TCA includes provisions for social security coordination, similar to EU law but considerably weaker. These provisions are found in Heading Four and are not typical of standard trade agreements like CETA.
Many are interested in the future of the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) scheme, as private travel insurance is often expensive or inaccessible, particularly for the elderly...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/analysis-1-examination-of-healthcare-entitlements-in-the-eu-uk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/analysis-1-examination-of-healthcare-entitlements-in-the-eu-uk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Analysis of the Environment and Climate Provisions in the Brexit Deal</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/analysis-of-the-environment-and-climate-provisions-in-the-brexit-deal/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Mar 2023 15:51:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/analysis-of-the-environment-and-climate-provisions-in-the-brexit-deal/</guid><description>Introduction
