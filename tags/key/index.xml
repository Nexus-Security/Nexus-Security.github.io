The free app WiFi Master Key, which helps users find and connect to crowdsourced Wi-Fi hotspots, is gaining popularity in Southeast Asia. It helps people access the internet in a region where connectivity is rapidly expanding.
The app lets users share Wi-Fi hotspot information with the community. While this information allows others to connect for free, the app prioritizes privacy and security by encrypting and storing shared Wi-Fi passwords in its cloud database instead of revealing them directly.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Keyboard Keys - Video About Removal and Installation</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-keyboard-keys-video-about-removal-and-installation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Sep 2023 02:04:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-keyboard-keys-video-about-removal-and-installation/</guid><description>After restoring a Beogram 4000, I shipped it to a customer, but two keypad keys came loose during transport. To secure them, I had used tape and foam, but the shipping stress was too much for the delicate leaf spring mechanism holding the keys.
To prevent this from happening again, I created special tools that make it easier to install the keys and shared a video demonstrating their use. These tools, designed to avoid damaging the aluminum, are available to other enthusiasts.</description></item></channel></rss>
