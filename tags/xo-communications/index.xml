This shift to an IP-based network and the use of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for telephone trunking are rendering traditional telephony services obsolete. By utilizing a packet-switched network and transmitting everything in packet protocol, voice, and data traffic can easily share a single circuit.
The concept of convergence, using one network for voice, video, and data, has gained traction with IT departments aiming to simplify network management and executives seeking cost reductions...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/buy-convergence-by-the-byte/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/buy-convergence-by-the-byte/</a></p></description></item><item><title>XO Communications Nears Tbps National Network</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/xo-communications-nears-tbps-national-network/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2024 01:23:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/xo-communications-nears-tbps-national-network/</guid><description>Any lingering doubts about the supposed overabundance of bandwidth in the late &amp;rsquo;90s telecom boom should be dispelled by XO Communications&amp;rsquo; recent announcement. Despite upgrading their national backbone just last year, XO is increasing its capacity again. This upgrade will boost major coast-to-coast network routes from 400 Gbps to a staggering 800 Gbps, putting them within reach of terabit-per-second speeds.
This massive capacity increase is driven by a fivefold surge in demand for high-capacity inter-city network services over the past year, according to XO...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/xo-communications-nears-tbps-national-network/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/xo-communications-nears-tbps-national-network/</a></p></description></item><item><title>E911 For Enterprise VoIP</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/e911-for-enterprise-voip/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jan 2024 00:01:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/e911-for-enterprise-voip/</guid><description>The transition from traditional phone lines to internet-based calling has brought about some unexpected issues, particularly with emergency services. We often take 911 for granted, assuming help will always be on the way. However, this isn&amp;rsquo;t always the case with internet-based phone systems.
Imagine a scenario where a fire breaks out in your office. You dial 911, report the emergency, and evacuate.

When subscribing to bandwidth, you&amp;rsquo;re usually expected to understand your network&amp;rsquo;s needs and pick the optimal service. But what if your needs are unclear or fluctuate? What about transitioning from in-house IT to cloud-based services? What are the consequences of an incorrect choice?
Traditional Bandwidth Services Fall Short
Conventional line contracts offer fixed bandwidth for a predetermined period, like a DS3 connection providing 45 Mbps constantly. While this guarantees consistent speed, you pay even when it&amp;rsquo;s idle...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/do-you-need-bandwidth-on-demand/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/do-you-need-bandwidth-on-demand/</a></p></description></item><item><title>What XO’s 1,000,000 VoIP Customers Predicts</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-xo-s-1-000-000-voip-customers-predicts/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Feb 2023 12:55:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-xo-s-1-000-000-voip-customers-predicts/</guid><description>XO Communications, a leading competitor in the telecom industry, recently celebrated a significant achievement: reaching one million business VoIP users.
Reaching this milestone in just five years surprised even XO. This rapid adoption might be unexpected for those hesitant about embracing VoIP technology.
