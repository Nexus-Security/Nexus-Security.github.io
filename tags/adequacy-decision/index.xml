Introduction
A Bosnian folk song tells the story of a Pasha who died from a severe illness. When his wife heard about his passing, she died from grief. Similarly, now that the UK has chosen to leave the European Union, will the same fate befall data protection laws once the UK exits the EU?
The UK&amp;rsquo;s current data protection law, the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA), incorporates the EU&amp;rsquo;s 1995 Data Protection Directive.</description></item><item><title>The draft adequacy decisions: Data Protection in the UK and the EU</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-draft-adequacy-decisions-data-protection-in-the-uk-and-the-eu/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Sep 2022 03:10:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-draft-adequacy-decisions-data-protection-in-the-uk-and-the-eu/</guid><description>Lorna Woods, Professor of Internet Law, University of Essex
Background
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Law Enforcement Directive (LED) have strict rules about transferring personal data outside the EU. Adequacy decisions are the simplest way to ensure these transfers are safe. Currently, twelve countries have received full or partial adequacy decisions, including Japan, which has additional safeguards in place. The US previously held an adequacy status, but the Court of Justice overturned this in the Schrems II case.</description></item><item><title>The case of Elgizouli v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2020] UKSC 10 involves issues related to data protection, the death penalty, and mutual legal assistance in criminal law.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-case-of-elgizouli-v-secretary-of-state-for-the-home-department-2020-uksc-10-involves-issues-related-to-data-protection-the-death-penalty-and-mutual-legal-assistance-in-criminal-law/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Aug 2022 15:07:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-case-of-elgizouli-v-secretary-of-state-for-the-home-department-2020-uksc-10-involves-issues-related-to-data-protection-the-death-penalty-and-mutual-legal-assistance-in-criminal-law/</guid><description>Lorna Woods, Professor of Internet Law, University of Essex
Introduction
The Elgizouli case marks the first UK Supreme Court ruling on the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA). The key takeaway is that simply mostly complying with the Act&amp;rsquo;s requirements isn&amp;rsquo;t enough to legalize data transfers to other countries. This judgment centers around Part Three of the DPA, which puts the Law Enforcement Directive into action and emphasizes procedural safeguards. However, the court&amp;rsquo;s methodology might have broader consequences for how UK courts interpret the DPA and the GDPR, particularly regarding the protection of individual rights outlined in the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).</description></item></channel></rss>
