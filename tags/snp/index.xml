During the Scottish National Party (SNP) conference, Scotland&amp;rsquo;s First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, revealed the Scottish Government&amp;rsquo;s plan to present a draft bill for a second independence referendum. She also announced their intention to introduce an alternate plan ensuring Scotland&amp;rsquo;s continued participation in the EU single market, even if the rest of the UK chooses to leave. This proposal would involve granting the Scottish Parliament substantial new powers, encompassing all current EU-related powers held by Scotland and additional authority to negotiate international treaties and manage immigration.</description></item></channel></rss>
