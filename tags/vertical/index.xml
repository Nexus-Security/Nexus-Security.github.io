It needed adjustments to align it properly. The service manual suggests adjusting the platter in relation to the chassis first, and then aligning the chassis within the enclosure. This ensures the platter sits flush and centered within the panel, achieving that desirable &amp;ldquo;Beoloving&amp;rdquo; aesthetic.
