To address this, I opted to use SMD LEDs as replacements, similar to a method I&amp;rsquo;ve used for Beomaster 8000 units, documented on my blog. This provides lasting stability and safeguards against potential shipping damage. However, the Beocord 9000 has more compact reflector housings compared to the Beomaster 8000, necessitating a redesign of the PCBs for the LEDs...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-replacing-the-incandescent-indicator-light-bulbs-with-smd-leds/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-replacing-the-incandescent-indicator-light-bulbs-with-smd-leds/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beocord 9000: Total Recap - Replacement of all Electrolytic Capacitors</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-total-recap-replacement-of-all-electrolytic-capacitors/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Oct 2023 10:32:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-total-recap-replacement-of-all-electrolytic-capacitors/</guid><description>This article revisits a complete restoration of a Beocord 9000 cassette deck, focusing on the replacement of electrolytic capacitors for improved long-term reliability.

The unit is in good cosmetic condition with minor wear. Upon inspection, the platter motor ran when turned on, but the carriage remained static.
Further investigation revealed that transistor TR20, responsible for the carriage motor control, was faulty. Replacing this component restored carriage movement.
However, the carriage would move only slightly before returning to its starting position...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-first-contact-and-two-dead-transistors/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-first-contact-and-two-dead-transistors/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5523): Adjustment of Platter and Sub-Chassis Alignment, Installation of New Transport Lock Bushings and Adjustment of the Tonearm</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5523-adjustment-of-platter-and-sub-chassis-alignment-installation-of-new-transport-lock-bushings-and-adjustment-of-the-tonearm/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Mar 2023 02:55:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5523-adjustment-of-platter-and-sub-chassis-alignment-installation-of-new-transport-lock-bushings-and-adjustment-of-the-tonearm/</guid><description>After restoring the mechanics and electronics of a Beogram 4002 (5523) turntable, it was time to ensure proper alignment of the platter, sub-chassis, and tonearm. The first step was centering the sub-chassis within the transport locks. However, a previous repair attempt had misaligned the transport locks, preventing adjustment. Taking the opportunity, new bushings were installed to replace the deteriorated originals, evidenced by orange plastic fragments within the enclosure.

The unit arrived from overseas in just three days and was packaged very well, ensuring its safe arrival.
The exterior looks good overall. The wood veneer is undamaged and the dust cover can be polished back to its original shine.
The aluminum trim on the back of the dust cover needs to be reattached, which should be a simple fix. Inside, the aluminum plates need a thorough cleaning...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-new-arrival-from-italy/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-new-arrival-from-italy/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Polishing the Hood and a Strange Hinge Pin</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-polishing-the-hood-and-a-strange-hinge-pin/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Mar 2023 12:08:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-polishing-the-hood-and-a-strange-hinge-pin/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m completing the restoration of a Beogram 4000 turntable by addressing the final detail: polishing the dust cover. This one, like many I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered, had scratches from improper storage.
This particular unit had a non-original hinge pin, longer than the original, causing it to protrude. I shortened it, restoring a flush fit. The aluminum trim on the other side had also detached, which I reattached using double-sided tape for easy future removal...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-polishing-the-hood-and-a-strange-hinge-pin/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-polishing-the-hood-and-a-strange-hinge-pin/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): Re-Attaching Keypad Segments</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-re-attaching-keypad-segments/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Mar 2023 09:10:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-re-attaching-keypad-segments/</guid><description>My Beogram 4002 (5513) restoration is moving along, and I&amp;rsquo;m currently focusing on aesthetics. The last step was to reattach two keypad sections that had become unglued. The image illustrates the problem:

It&amp;rsquo;s important to use minimal glue to avoid damaging the delicate paint on the pad&amp;rsquo;s surface.
