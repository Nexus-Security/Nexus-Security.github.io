To address this, a modern PCB design with a buck converter-based 24V supply was created as a replacement for the original power supply and capacitors.
The new design features high-quality Panasonic electrolytic capacitors, Samsung ceramic capacitors for the motor phase, and a buck converter for the 24V power supply. It&amp;rsquo;s designed to be easily installed in place of the original components.</description></item></channel></rss>
