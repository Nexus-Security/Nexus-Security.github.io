To secure them, I had used tape and foam, but the shipping stress was too much for the delicate leaf spring mechanism holding the keys.
To prevent this from happening again, I created special tools that make it easier to install the keys and shared a video demonstrating their use. These tools, designed to avoid damaging the aluminum, are available to other enthusiasts...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-keyboard-keys-video-about-removal-and-installation/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-keyboard-keys-video-about-removal-and-installation/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 Commander Remote Control: Installation Video</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-commander-remote-control-installation-video/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 19:35:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-commander-remote-control-installation-video/</guid><description>My Beogram 4002 &amp;ldquo;Commander&amp;rdquo; remote control system has recently seen a surge in popularity, with multiple orders coming in over a short time. This could be linked to the Commander&amp;rsquo;s new compatibility with a specific Apple TV remote, allowing it to integrate with Apple devices in the same space. Designed for later models of the 4002 turntable with the keypad connector on the main circuit board (types 551x and 552x), I recently built three receivers over the weekend and shipped them out today, each packaged with a compatible Apple remote:..<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-commander-remote-control-installation-video/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-commander-remote-control-installation-video/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beocord 9000: Repair of a Broken Out DIN-7 Jack With 3D Printed Inserts</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-repair-of-a-broken-out-din-7-jack-with-3d-printed-inserts/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jul 2023 18:32:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-repair-of-a-broken-out-din-7-jack-with-3d-printed-inserts/</guid><description>Repairing the broken DIN 7 jack on the Beocord 9000 was simpler than anticipated. The part is identical to the one used for the Beomaster 8000&amp;rsquo;s Phono input. A 3D printed part, designed previously, was used to replace the fragile tabs on these sockets, which often break and cause the jack to fall into the panel cutout. Images of the broken jack and the 3D printed replacements are included.
A short video demonstrating the installation process and the repaired plug is provided...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-repair-of-a-broken-out-din-7-jack-with-3d-printed-inserts/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-repair-of-a-broken-out-din-7-jack-with-3d-printed-inserts/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beocord 9000: First Contact and Installing New Belts</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-first-contact-and-installing-new-belts/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Oct 2022 10:42:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-first-contact-and-installing-new-belts/</guid><description>I recently received a Beocord 9000 cassette deck that needed some care. It was shipped in its original Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen box, which was then placed inside a second box for protection. However, the B&amp;amp;O box was incorrectly oriented inside the outer box, likely resulting in an upside-down journey. The original box had some water damage:
Thankfully, the Beocord 9000 itself appeared unharmed:
As a rule, I never connect devices to power immediately after unpacking...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-first-contact-and-installing-new-belts/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-first-contact-and-installing-new-belts/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
