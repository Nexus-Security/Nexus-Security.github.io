Determining the employment rights of undocumented migrants is complex. On one hand, granting them full access to employment law protections could incentivize unauthorized migration. On the other hand, applying standard employment laws to all workers, regardless of immigration status, could prevent the exploitation of undocumented migrants and deter employers from hiring them to save money.
The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) addressed this issue in the Tumer case, which focused on the application of the EU Directive on insolvent employers to undocumented migrants.</description></item></channel></rss>
