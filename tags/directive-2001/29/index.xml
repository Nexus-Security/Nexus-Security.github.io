The case grapples with the interpretation of copyright exceptions for parodies within EU law, specifically Article 5(3)(k) of the Infosoc Directive, which permits member states to allow exceptions for caricature, parody, or pastiche.
Jacques highlights the timely relevance of the opinion, given the ongoing debate over copyright exceptions and the delayed implementation of a parody exception in the UK...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/could-this-be-a-parody-the-advocate-general-s-viewpoint-on-the-deckmyn-case/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/could-this-be-a-parody-the-advocate-general-s-viewpoint-on-the-deckmyn-case/</a></p></description></item><item><title>We have the freedom to laugh at anything, but not everyone can appreciate it!"

The Advocate-General recently issued an opinion on parody, sparking significant interest in the topic. This opinion, while not yet available in English, has been the subject of discussion in legal circles. Further amplifying this attention, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has now released its own judgment on the matter...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/we-have-the-freedom-to-laugh-at-anything-but-not-everyone-can-appreciate-it-examining-the-boundaries-of-freedom-of-expression-through-parody-the-ruling-of-the-cjeu-in-the-deckmyn-case/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/we-have-the-freedom-to-laugh-at-anything-but-not-everyone-can-appreciate-it-examining-the-boundaries-of-freedom-of-expression-through-parody-the-ruling-of-the-cjeu-in-the-deckmyn-case/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Is the REDA report a significant step forward for the parody exception in EU copyright law?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-reda-report-a-significant-step-forward-for-the-parody-exception-in-eu-copyright-law/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Oct 2022 03:00:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-reda-report-a-significant-step-forward-for-the-parody-exception-in-eu-copyright-law/</guid><description>By Sabine Jacques
In the middle of January, Pirate Party Member of European Parliament, Julia Reda, shared a draft of her report examining the implementation of the Information Society Directive 2001/29/EC (often called the &amp;lsquo;InfoSoc Directive&amp;rsquo;). This report has been praised by some as groundbreaking for its progressive stance on copyright in the digital age, while others have criticized it as being too radical or even unacceptable. These strong reactions highlight the widespread interest in the report and its potential impact, particularly within digital rights communities...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-reda-report-a-significant-step-forward-for-the-parody-exception-in-eu-copyright-law/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-reda-report-a-significant-step-forward-for-the-parody-exception-in-eu-copyright-law/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The ECJ clarifies EU's authority over copyright law in the Marrakesh Treaty ruling.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-ecj-clarifies-eu-s-authority-over-copyright-law-in-the-marrakesh-treaty-ruling/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Aug 2022 02:37:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-ecj-clarifies-eu-s-authority-over-copyright-law-in-the-marrakesh-treaty-ruling/</guid><description>Gesa Kübek, PhD candidate at the law faculty of the University of Passau.
In its February 14, 2017 Opinion 3/15, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) determined that the European Union (EU) possesses exclusive competence to enter into the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons Who Are Blind, Visually Impaired, or Otherwise Print Disabled (hereafter: Marrakesh Treaty). This decision aligns with Advocate General (AG) Wahl’s prior Opinion, which similarly argued for exclusive EU competence in this domain...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-ecj-clarifies-eu-s-authority-over-copyright-law-in-the-marrakesh-treaty-ruling/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-ecj-clarifies-eu-s-authority-over-copyright-law-in-the-marrakesh-treaty-ruling/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
