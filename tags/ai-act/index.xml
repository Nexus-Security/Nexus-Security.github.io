1. Proposal Goals
The European Commission&amp;rsquo;s proposal for an AI Liability Directive, published on September 28, 2022, alongside an updated Product Liability Directive, aims to address the risks posed by artificial intelligence (AI) while acknowledging its potential benefits. The proposal stems from a report recognizing the potential harm AI systems can cause due to their connectivity, unpredictable nature, and opacity, which makes it difficult to assign responsibility for AI-related incidents...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-ec-is-proposing-an-ai-liability-directive-to-provide-assistance/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-ec-is-proposing-an-ai-liability-directive-to-provide-assistance/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The European Union should consider the UK police's use of live facial recognition technology when developing regulations for law enforcement.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-european-union-should-consider-the-uk-police-s-use-of-live-facial-recognition-technology-when-developing-regulations-for-law-enforcement/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jun 2024 14:07:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-european-union-should-consider-the-uk-police-s-use-of-live-facial-recognition-technology-when-developing-regulations-for-law-enforcement/</guid><description>Divergent Approaches to Regulating Live Facial Recognition Dr. Asress Adimi Gikay, a Senior Lecturer in AI, Disruptive Innovation, and Law at Brunel University London, explores the contrasting approaches to regulating live facial recognition (LFR) in the UK and the European Union.

Why a Complete Ban on Real-Time Remote Biometric Identification Systems Is Not the Answer
The European Commission&amp;rsquo;s proposed Artificial Intelligence Act (EU-AIA), intended to regulate AI use, has faced criticism since its introduction two years ago. A key point of contention is the regulation&amp;rsquo;s stance on law enforcement&amp;rsquo;s use of Real-Time Remote Biometric Identification Systems (RT-RBIS) in public spaces...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-necessary-for-the-eu-to-prohibit-the-real-time-use-of-remote-biometric-identification-systems-for-law-enforcement-purposes/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-necessary-for-the-eu-to-prohibit-the-real-time-use-of-remote-biometric-identification-systems-for-law-enforcement-purposes/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
