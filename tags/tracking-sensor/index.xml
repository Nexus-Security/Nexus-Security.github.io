This was necessary to access the tangential arm for repairs and to thoroughly clean the disintegrated transport bushings.
Fragments of the old bushings were scattered throughout the chassis, even within the tonearm cover.
This image shows the Beogram chassis after a thorough cleaning.
Next, 3D-printed replacement bushings from Beolover were installed.
The new bushings fit perfectly. When reattaching the floating chassis, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to align the top and bottom locking washers on their respective threads...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-progress-update/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-progress-update/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 Type 5513: Going over the chassis and mechanical parts</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-going-over-the-chassis-and-mechanical-parts/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Nov 2022 18:28:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-going-over-the-chassis-and-mechanical-parts/</guid><description>The two circuit boards that needed component updates are finished. Now, I&amp;rsquo;m focusing on the Beogram 4002&amp;rsquo;s cabinet and its mechanical parts.
I prefer working on the floating chassis with it removed, which is easier since I&amp;rsquo;ll disassemble most of the tangential arm.
This revealed some hidden issues.
Initially, I believed the three chassis lock bushings were okay because they looked fine. However, examining the locking mechanism showed otherwise.
This was the first indication of the bushings&amp;rsquo; poor condition...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-going-over-the-chassis-and-mechanical-parts/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-going-over-the-chassis-and-mechanical-parts/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
