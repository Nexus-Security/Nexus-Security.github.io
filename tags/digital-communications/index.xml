Internet broadband speeds have increased significantly in recent times. While a few Mbps was initially considered sufficient, businesses are now rapidly adopting speeds of 100 Mbps and higher, with the FCC setting a 25 Mbps benchmark for broadband. This shift signifies escalating bandwidth demands driven by the increasing reliance on remote resources and the changing nature of online content.
What Does The New Standard Represent?
The updated broadband standards highlight the growing need for greater bandwidth.</description></item><item><title>CloudEthernet Forum Ensures Ethernet Will Dominate</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/cloudethernet-forum-ensures-ethernet-will-dominate/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Nov 2022 00:08:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/cloudethernet-forum-ensures-ethernet-will-dominate/</guid><description>Ethernet has dominated the network space for decades, outliving technologies like Token Ring and Token Bus. While alternatives like Fibre Channel and T-Carrier still exist, the rise of cloud computing presents a new challenge to Ethernet&amp;rsquo;s dominance. This challenge led to the creation of the CloudEthernet Forum, a group aiming to adapt Ethernet for the demanding requirements of cloud services.
The enormous increase in networked devices, from traditional computers to virtual machines and the Internet of Things, is putting a strain on existing Ethernet infrastructure.</description></item><item><title>T1 Voice Options for Call Quality</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/t1-voice-options-for-call-quality/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jun 2022 19:12:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/t1-voice-options-for-call-quality/</guid><description>For businesses reliant on phone communication, exceptional call quality is non-negotiable. This means clear, natural-sounding voices with minimal disruptions like dropped calls, echoes, or choppy audio. If this resonates, T1 voice service might be your solution.
T1 lines are a natural fit for business phone systems as they were intentionally designed for this purpose. T-Carrier technology, including T1 (1.5 Mbps) and T3 (45 Mbps), was initially developed for use by phone companies.</description></item></channel></rss>
