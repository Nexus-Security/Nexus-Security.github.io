I prefer working on the same type of audio equipment consecutively because it minimizes workbench setup time.
The owner followed our packing advice and packaged the turntable very well, using double boxes and protective foam. The turntable arrived without damage.
Upon opening, I noticed the metal tonearm lid wouldn&amp;rsquo;t stay up. The part that connects to the hinge with damping grease was detached, a problem I haven&amp;rsquo;t encountered before.</description></item></channel></rss>
