This highlighted the fragility of these bulbs and emphasized the need for a more durable solution. To address this, the original bulbs were replaced with custom-designed LED replacements.
Specifically, the two position indicator bulbs were replaced with surface-mounted LED (SMD LED) units. The two bulbs responsible for illuminating the RPM trimmers were replaced with high-intensity red LEDs...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-replacement-of-incandescent-light-bulbs-in-control-panel-with-leds/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-replacement-of-incandescent-light-bulbs-in-control-panel-with-leds/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 Commander Remote Control: Mass Production!</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-commander-remote-control-mass-production-/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jun 2022 02:04:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-commander-remote-control-mass-production-/</guid><description>More orders for the Beogram 4002 Commander remote control have been placed. The Commander is now compatible with a designated Apple TV remote, eliminating interference with other Apple devices in the same room. Designed specifically for later models of the 4002 turntable (types 551x and 552x) that feature the keypad connector on the main circuit board, the Commander offers a simple plug-and-play installation process. Today, five new units were assembled...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-commander-remote-control-mass-production-/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-commander-remote-control-mass-production-/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Adjusting the AC Motor Voltage and Measuring the Voltage Differences Between the Phases</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-adjusting-the-ac-motor-voltage-and-measuring-the-voltage-differences-between-the-phases/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jun 2022 19:29:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-adjusting-the-ac-motor-voltage-and-measuring-the-voltage-differences-between-the-phases/</guid><description>During the restoration of a Beogram 4000 turntable, the AC motor requires precise adjustment. The service manual recommends setting the main phase voltage to 6V (RMS) and the frequency to 42.3 Hz for 33 RPM using an oscilloscope. To observe both motor phases, connect the oscilloscope probes across the phase capacitor.
Begin the adjustment by setting the 33 RPM trimmer on the control panel to its neutral position. This allows for fine-tuning the RPM offset potentiometer on the main PCB to achieve the target 42...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-adjusting-the-ac-motor-voltage-and-measuring-the-voltage-differences-between-the-phases/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-adjusting-the-ac-motor-voltage-and-measuring-the-voltage-differences-between-the-phases/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Adjusting the Tracking Force and Replacing the Strange Original Front Center Cabinet Guiding Washer</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-adjusting-the-tracking-force-and-replacing-the-strange-original-front-center-cabinet-guiding-washer/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2022 03:22:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-adjusting-the-tracking-force-and-replacing-the-strange-original-front-center-cabinet-guiding-washer/</guid><description>My Beogram 4000 restoration is complete, and it&amp;rsquo;s playing beautifully. As I write this, I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying &amp;ldquo;Song for My Father&amp;rdquo; by Horace Silver on a reissue, as original pressings are unfortunately outside my budget these days.
One of the final tasks was refining the Beogram&amp;rsquo;s mechanics. I calibrated the tonearm weight and limits and replaced the guiding washer, which ensures the plinth moves smoothly. The original washer, pictured below, has a design flaw that was later corrected in the Beogram 400x series...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-adjusting-the-tracking-force-and-replacing-the-strange-original-front-center-cabinet-guiding-washer/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-adjusting-the-tracking-force-and-replacing-the-strange-original-front-center-cabinet-guiding-washer/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
