This is unfortunate because D Block was supposed to play a crucial role in establishing a nationwide public service network. This plan, which could serve as a model for other initiatives, deserves further consideration, especially in challenging economic times.
The idea for D Block originated after the September 11, 2001, attacks, when communication breakdowns hampered rescue efforts.</description></item></channel></rss>
