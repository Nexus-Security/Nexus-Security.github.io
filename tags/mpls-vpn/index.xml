While private networks offer the highest level of security, they are expensive to build and maintain. Using the public internet is cheaper but raises security concerns.
A fully private network, offering top-notch security and performance, requires significant investment. Building a central hub and connecting each location with dedicated lines like T1 or Ethernet can become very costly, especially with increasing bandwidth demands and staffing for maintenance.</description></item><item><title>Covad Offers A Nationwide MPLS VPN Network For Business</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/covad-offers-a-nationwide-mpls-vpn-network-for-business/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Apr 2024 19:31:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/covad-offers-a-nationwide-mpls-vpn-network-for-business/</guid><description>Companies with numerous offices across the country have access to a new secure networking solution. Covad&amp;rsquo;s recently launched Intelligent Network Platform offers expanded WAN networking capabilities at a lower cost than traditional options.
Covad&amp;rsquo;s MPLS VPNs are designed for small to medium-sized businesses and larger dispersed companies needing to connect multiple locations, such as franchises, remote offices, warehouses, retail stores, factories, and hotels. Multi-location networking presents two key challenges: establishing secure and reliable connections between all sites and doing so cost-effectively.</description></item><item><title>IP WAN over MPLS Advantages</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ip-wan-over-mpls-advantages/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Feb 2024 05:22:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ip-wan-over-mpls-advantages/</guid><description>The internet is often the first thing that comes to mind when considering IP wide area networks. Although it boasts near-universal accessibility and relatively low access costs, it presents significant drawbacks for business use. Factors like bandwidth, latency, jitter, and packet loss lack guarantees and predictability. Additionally, security on the internet is unreliable. However, are alternative methods for interconnecting business locations excessively expensive or difficult to manage?
It&amp;rsquo;s feasible to establish a private IP network that enables the use of your existing IP addressing system, eliminating the need for encryption, firewalls, tunnels, or supplementary hardware.</description></item><item><title>GTT Expands Ethernet Footprint With PacketExchange</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/gtt-expands-ethernet-footprint-with-packetexchange/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Sep 2023 23:52:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/gtt-expands-ethernet-footprint-with-packetexchange/</guid><description>GTT, a global telecommunications company, is expanding its Ethernet services globally by acquiring PacketExchange, an Ethernet provider. PacketExchange, based in London, boasts a substantial 10 Gigabit fiber optic IP network spanning Europe, the United States, and Asia, largely acquired through its acquisition of MZIMA Networks in 2010. This combined infrastructure offers private line services, MPLS, VPLS networking, and peering capabilities.
This acquisition highlights the growing dominance of Carrier Ethernet in telecommunications.</description></item><item><title>Broadband Ethernet Internet Services</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/broadband-ethernet-internet-services/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jul 2023 01:22:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/broadband-ethernet-internet-services/</guid><description>Ethernet point-to-point and LAN services have gained popularity among businesses, often replacing T1 lines and outdated Frame Relay networks. Ethernet is also a great way to connect to MPLS VPN networks and the internet.
Carrier Ethernet began as a business-oriented Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) service known as Metro Ethernet, often used by companies to connect multiple locations within a specific geographic region. E-Line point-to-point services like EPL and EVPL provide comparable or superior connectivity to T1 lines, even when multiple T1 lines are used.</description></item><item><title>MegaPathâ€™s Black Friday Strategy</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/megapath-s-black-friday-strategy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Sep 2022 19:28:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/megapath-s-black-friday-strategy/</guid><description>Black Friday, the day following Thanksgiving, is the traditional kickoff for Christmas shopping. Its success is crucial for retailers, as it can significantly impact their yearly profitability.
The term &amp;ldquo;Black Friday&amp;rdquo; is believed to originate from the accounting practice of using red ink for losses and black ink for profits. Many retailers struggle throughout the year, making the holiday shopping season, especially Black Friday, vital for their financial stability.
Black Friday, along with its online counterpart Cyber Monday (the Monday after Thanksgiving), initiates the busiest and most demanding sales period for retailers.</description></item></channel></rss>
