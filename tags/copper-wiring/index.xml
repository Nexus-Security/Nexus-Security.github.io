Copper is quickly disappearing from telecommunications networks, being replaced by fiber optic cabling. While this new cabling might be installed in the same spaces as the old copper, the outdated copper lines are often left behind.
You might be thinking, &amp;ldquo;But I still use copper connections!&amp;rdquo; And it&amp;rsquo;s true that many devices use copper wiring. So where exactly is all this fiber?
Mostly Fiber Outside, Mostly Copper Inside..<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/fiber-to-the-curb-and-premises/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/fiber-to-the-curb-and-premises/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Ethernet Everywhere?

For a while now, experts have predicted a future where all networking standards converge into one: Ethernet. We are nearing a reality where T1, DS3, OCx, and others will be obsolete. How close are we? Very close!
Network Standards Already Favor Ethernet Telecommunications companies are embracing a once-unthinkable idea: they are replacing their proprietary standards with Ethernet services.
The reason is simple: market demand. The past saw many Local Area Network standards...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-everywhere-we-re-almost-there-/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-everywhere-we-re-almost-there-/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Fiber Optic Cable Gets Limber</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/fiber-optic-cable-gets-limber/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Sep 2022 05:38:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/fiber-optic-cable-gets-limber/</guid><description>Fiber optic and copper cable are competing to be the main wiring used in communication setups, whether for renovations, improvements, or brand new projects. However, fiber is already recognized as the superior long-term option. Copper persists due to its widespread implementation and compatibility with existing switches and routers.
A significant installation obstacle has hindered the widespread adoption of fiber optic cabling: limited fiber bending flexibility. Exceeding this limit not only risks snapping the delicate strands but also creates functional issues...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/fiber-optic-cable-gets-limber/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/fiber-optic-cable-gets-limber/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
