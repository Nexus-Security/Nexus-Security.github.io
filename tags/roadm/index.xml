These services will be available in the San Francisco Bay Area and Silicon Valley, including key locations like Santa Clara and San Jose, California.
AboveNet&amp;rsquo;s Core Wave solutions utilize ROADM (Reconfigurable Optical Add/Drop Multiplexer) technology, enabling dynamic wavelength add/drops for various protocols such as Ethernet, TDM, storage, and video transport. This results in flexible service options, scalability, and fast provisioning.</description></item><item><title>AboveNet Core Wave Makes Dedicated Wavelength Bandwidth Available</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/abovenet-core-wave-makes-dedicated-wavelength-bandwidth-available/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jun 2022 00:49:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/abovenet-core-wave-makes-dedicated-wavelength-bandwidth-available/</guid><description>When standard bandwidth solutions are insufficient, AboveNet&amp;rsquo;s Core Wave service provides high-capacity bandwidth. This service is designed for sectors with demanding applications, such as finance, media, healthcare, retail, and government, that require the robust capabilities of fiber optic transport.
Many telecom services utilize multiplexing, which combines multiple bandwidth services onto a single fiber optic core network. However, for organizations with exceptionally high bandwidth demands, a dedicated solution may be necessary.</description></item></channel></rss>
