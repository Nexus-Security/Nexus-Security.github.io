Let&amp;rsquo;s say you&amp;rsquo;re a well-known UK politician who spends most of their time speaking on British radio or working in the US, only occasionally attending their primary job in France or Belgium. Imagine this politician is divorcing their German spouse. Which court and legal system would handle the divorce and child custody matters?
This scenario falls under the larger subject of international civil litigation, also known as private international law, which is the focus of the UK government&amp;rsquo;s most recent position paper on Brexit negotiations...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/analysis-of-the-uk-government-s-proposals-for-cross-border-civil-litigation-post-brexit/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/analysis-of-the-uk-government-s-proposals-for-cross-border-civil-litigation-post-brexit/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Miller's ruling: Representative Democracy Makes a Comeback</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/miller-s-ruling-representative-democracy-makes-a-comeback/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Sep 2022 12:44:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/miller-s-ruling-representative-democracy-makes-a-comeback/</guid><description>Professor Steve Peers
The UK Supreme Court recently issued its judgment in the Miller case (and a similar Northern Ireland case) regarding the UK&amp;rsquo;s exit from the EU. This post will summarize the judgment&amp;rsquo;s main points and examine its implications for Brexit and Parliament&amp;rsquo;s role. Professor Mark Elliott has already provided a thorough legal analysis, which can be found elsewhere.
The case revolves around two central issues: Parliament&amp;rsquo;s role in initiating Article 50 and the role of devolved legislatures...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/miller-s-ruling-representative-democracy-makes-a-comeback/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/miller-s-ruling-representative-democracy-makes-a-comeback/</a></p></description></item><item><title>A revival of the Brexit negotiations?

Prime Minister Theresa May&amp;rsquo;s recent speech was largely seen as an effort to jumpstart the Brexit negotiations, which have hit a roadblock, particularly regarding financial matters. The question is whether her speech will be successful, or if its underlying goal of appeasing Leave voters in the UK, especially those in the cabinet and the media, will undermine its effectiveness. Additionally, it prompts questions about the future relationship between the UK and the EU...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-revival-of-the-brexit-negotiations-theresa-may-s-address-in-florence/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-revival-of-the-brexit-negotiations-theresa-may-s-address-in-florence/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
