masking, not noise cancellation.
These sleepbuds, the most compact product Bose has developed, come equipped with 10 preloaded &amp;ldquo;sleeptracks.&amp;rdquo; These tracks are designed to mimic the frequencies of common noises like snoring, neighbors, dogs, and traffic, effectively masking them with calming audio.</description></item></channel></rss>
