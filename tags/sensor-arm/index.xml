Unlike other bulbs I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered, which typically display a dark film on the glass due to filament evaporation, this one was spotless:
This suggests that this particular Beogram was either lightly used or had its bulb replaced previously. As a result, I will not change it. However, the bulb&amp;rsquo;s placement within its compartment is worth noting.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000 Arrives From UK! Solenoid Oscillates!</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-arrives-from-uk-solenoid-oscillates-/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Mar 2024 13:40:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-arrives-from-uk-solenoid-oscillates-/</guid><description>I recently acquired another Beogram 4000 from the UK. The unit is in fair shape; importantly, the MMC cartridge mount is undamaged and the sensor arm insert is present. The control panel for the cueing and tonearm lift detached during shipping, highlighting the wisdom of securing such parts. Thankfully, the seller had protected the turntable with a durable plastic sheet, preventing any damage. Reattaching the panel should be simple.
Internally, all parts appear to be present:</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): Repair of a Broken Sensor Arm Photocell with Three SMD Photodiodes</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-repair-of-a-broken-sensor-arm-photocell-with-three-smd-photodiodes/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Nov 2023 15:02:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-repair-of-a-broken-sensor-arm-photocell-with-three-smd-photodiodes/</guid><description>During the restoration of a Beogram 4002 turntable, a broken photocell presented a challenge. This component, crucial for record detection, was no longer available. While a previous solution involved using a modern phototransistor with circuit modifications, a simpler approach was considered.
Recognizing the functional similarity between photovoltaic cells and the original photocell, a test was conducted using readily available photodiodes. Initial results with a single photodiode proved insufficient, but connecting three in parallel yielded a promising voltage output.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Restoration of a Seized Solenoid to Tonearm Linkage</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-restoration-of-a-seized-solenoid-to-tonearm-linkage/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Nov 2022 11:07:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-restoration-of-a-seized-solenoid-to-tonearm-linkage/</guid><description>The Beogram 4000 I got from the UK had a seized linkage connecting the solenoid mechanism and tonearm. To lubricate this linkage, I had to disassemble the sensor arm assembly and remove it. Further inspection showed that the linkage&amp;rsquo;s rotating pin was stuck and had detached from its press-fit socket within the sensor arm base. I&amp;rsquo;ve created a video illustrating the problem and the repair process:</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000 Arrives!

It needs a little work, but it came with a perfect MMC20EN cartridge â€“ I&amp;rsquo;m listening to Miles Davis on it right now and it sounds incredible!
The outside and dust cover are in great shape, and the platter looks really good too. Here are my initial thoughts:
The control panel is nice (ignore the Sharpie marks under the position indicator for now&amp;hellip;):</description></item></channel></rss>
