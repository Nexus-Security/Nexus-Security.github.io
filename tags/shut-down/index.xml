I aimed to align the platter&amp;rsquo;s aluminum surface with the surrounding panels, center the sub-chassis within the transport locks&amp;rsquo; limits, and ensure the arms were parallel to the aluminum surfaces. It&amp;rsquo;s intricate work involving aligning numerous components. After gaining experience with this process, I achieved a satisfactory result, aligning the Beogram to specifications...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-adjusting-the-sub-chassis-and-the-platter-and-rpm-calibration/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-adjusting-the-sub-chassis-and-the-platter-and-rpm-calibration/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): Repair of a Broken SO ('Shut Off') Switch</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-repair-of-a-broken-so-shut-off-switch/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Oct 2022 05:52:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-repair-of-a-broken-so-shut-off-switch/</guid><description>This post continues the discussion about a malfunctioning &amp;ldquo;Shut Off&amp;rdquo; (SO) switch, which was missing a crucial plastic part, causing issues with the deck&amp;rsquo;s shutdown process. To address this, a 3D printed replacement part was designed and created. The &amp;ldquo;End Switch&amp;rdquo; (ES), still equipped with its plastic component, is pictured alongside the SO switch, highlighting the missing element.
Creating a functional replacement part was challenging due to its small size and the limitations of the 3D printer...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-repair-of-a-broken-so-shut-off-switch/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-repair-of-a-broken-so-shut-off-switch/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
