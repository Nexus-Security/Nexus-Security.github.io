While mobile broadband caters to both individuals and businesses, fixed wireline connections are generally split between business and consumer use.
This distinction exists because of the trade-off between cost and performance. Consumer internet, including home-based businesses, falls under &amp;ldquo;information services,&amp;rdquo; not &amp;ldquo;telecom services.&amp;rdquo; This means they have less regulation and fewer guarantees for customers...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/internet-bandwidth-connections-for-business/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/internet-bandwidth-connections-for-business/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Fractional and Full Gigabit Ethernet Options</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/fractional-and-full-gigabit-ethernet-options/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Jul 2022 21:12:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/fractional-and-full-gigabit-ethernet-options/</guid><description>By: John Shepler
Modern applications require increasingly high bandwidth. A 10 Mbps connection, considered entry-level, is often insufficient for businesses. Many need at least 100 Mbps WAN bandwidth to support real-time applications like VoIP and video conferencing, as well as latency-sensitive cloud connections. This ensures optimal performance even during peak usage. Larger businesses and those with technology-heavy needs might even require Gigabit connections, which are now readily available and more affordable than in the past...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/fractional-and-full-gigabit-ethernet-options/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/fractional-and-full-gigabit-ethernet-options/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Ethernet over DS3 Advantage</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-over-ds3-advantage/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2022 13:38:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-over-ds3-advantage/</guid><description>Ethernet over Copper and Ethernet over Fiber are becoming increasingly popular choices for WAN connections.
