To prevent damage, I had previously removed the rosewood trim.
The trim is attached to a metal frame that slides in and out to lock and unlock the cabinet. This frame relies on five guide washers, which are commonly broken in Beogram 4002 units. This one was no different. These washers have a unique design, as detailed in a past Beolover blog post...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-some-cabinet-work/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-some-cabinet-work/</a></p></description></item><item><title>A Pair of Beomaster 1900 Receivers for Restoration: Capacitor Replacement on Unit #2</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-pair-of-beomaster-1900-receivers-for-restoration-capacitor-replacement-on-unit-2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jul 2024 03:47:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-pair-of-beomaster-1900-receivers-for-restoration-capacitor-replacement-on-unit-2/</guid><description>The first Beomaster 1900 receiver is fully operational and undergoing testing in a listening room.

I&amp;rsquo;ll show an example of a later model board at the end.
One issue with the first-generation boards is the metal enclosure surrounding the processor ICs. While necessary for shielding, it makes accessing components difficult. B&amp;amp;O used soldered metal tabs to connect the upper and lower sections, but these tabs are soldered to the board&amp;rsquo;s ground plane, requiring significant heat for removal...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/-beomaster-8000-microcomputer-board-reworked/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/-beomaster-8000-microcomputer-board-reworked/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 Type 5513: Going Through the Service Manual Checks and Adjustments</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-going-through-the-service-manual-checks-and-adjustments/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jun 2022 11:36:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-going-through-the-service-manual-checks-and-adjustments/</guid><description>This past weekend, I began working on some of the checks and adjustments outlined in the Beogram 4002 service manual. The manual details both electrical and mechanical procedures.
On the electrical side, my primary focus is to ensure that the photo sensors generate strong signals when activated by their light sources. Maintaining correct voltages is crucial for the proper function of the Beogram 4002&amp;rsquo;s analog control system.
Mechanically, I&amp;rsquo;ll be aligning both the Beogram&amp;rsquo;s fixed arm and tonearm...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-going-through-the-service-manual-checks-and-adjustments/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5513-going-through-the-service-manual-checks-and-adjustments/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
