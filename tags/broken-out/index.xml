This component turned out to be the left leaf spring responsible for securing the head carrier. A comparison with the corresponding right spring revealed that a small ball bearing, crucial for smooth head movement, was missing.
Further investigation determined the ball bearing&amp;rsquo;s diameter to be 2.5 mm, and a readily available supply was procured. The broken plastic piece attached to the loose spring indicated that the original assembly, constantly under tension, had given way...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-repair-of-a-broken-out-leaf-spring-in-the-tape-mechanism/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-repair-of-a-broken-out-leaf-spring-in-the-tape-mechanism/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beocord 9000: Total Recap - Replacement of all Electrolytic Capacitors</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-total-recap-replacement-of-all-electrolytic-capacitors/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Oct 2023 10:32:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-total-recap-replacement-of-all-electrolytic-capacitors/</guid><description>This article revisits a complete restoration of a Beocord 9000 cassette deck, focusing on the replacement of electrolytic capacitors for improved long-term reliability. While not as crucial as with amplifiers due to lower operating temperatures, capacitor replacement is recommended for optimal performance.
The Beocord 9000, designed for serviceability, allows access to its numerous electrolytic capacitors. Unlike its predecessors, it offers easier access by removing the front and back panels instead of extracting the main circuit boards...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-total-recap-replacement-of-all-electrolytic-capacitors/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-total-recap-replacement-of-all-electrolytic-capacitors/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
