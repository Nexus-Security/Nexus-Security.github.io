The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), through its judgment in the Ruffer case, reinforced and broadened its stance on using minority languages in legal processes.
The case involved Mrs. Ruffer, a German citizen residing in Germany, who was injured in a skiing incident in Bolzano, Italy, a region where German is commonly spoken. She held Ms. Pokoma, a Czech citizen living in the Czech Republic, responsible for the accident and filed a lawsuit against her in the Italian courts.</description></item></channel></rss>
