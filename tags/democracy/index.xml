As an EU law and human rights professor for over two decades, the topic of sanctioning Member States for human rights violations was once straightforward. The enforcement procedure (Article 7 TEU) was never used, making in-depth discussions unnecessary. My focus remained on practical issues like arrest warrants and asylum seekers.
However, the landscape has shifted. Like Article 50, which also addresses the EU&amp;rsquo;s relationship with Member States, Article 7 seems hastily drafted without considering its practical application, possibly because its creators never anticipated its use...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/part-1-the-legal-framework-should-the-eu-impose-sanctions-on-its-member-states-for-violations-of-the-rule-of-law-and-human-rights/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/part-1-the-legal-framework-should-the-eu-impose-sanctions-on-its-member-states-for-violations-of-the-rule-of-law-and-human-rights/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Is it appropriate for the outcome of the European Parliament elections to dictate the selection of the next President of the European Commission, or are there valid concerns about this democratic process?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-appropriate-for-the-outcome-of-the-european-parliament-elections-to-dictate-the-selection-of-the-next-president-of-the-european-commission-or-are-there-valid-concerns-about-this-democratic-process/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2024 21:55:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-appropriate-for-the-outcome-of-the-european-parliament-elections-to-dictate-the-selection-of-the-next-president-of-the-european-commission-or-are-there-valid-concerns-about-this-democratic-process/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s doubtful the European Court of Justice will decide the next European Commission President. Election laws typically set the stage but don&amp;rsquo;t directly determine the winner, although there are notable exceptions like the 2000 US election.
The 2014 Commission President election is unique because the rules changed, and their interpretation is debated. Previously, the European Council appointed the President after European Parliament approval. The Treaty of Lisbon introduced new rules, applied for the first time, stating the Parliament &amp;ldquo;elects&amp;rdquo; the President based on the Council&amp;rsquo;s nomination, &amp;ldquo;taking account&amp;rdquo; of Parliament election results...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-appropriate-for-the-outcome-of-the-european-parliament-elections-to-dictate-the-selection-of-the-next-president-of-the-european-commission-or-are-there-valid-concerns-about-this-democratic-process/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-appropriate-for-the-outcome-of-the-european-parliament-elections-to-dictate-the-selection-of-the-next-president-of-the-european-commission-or-are-there-valid-concerns-about-this-democratic-process/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Dear UK Members of Parliament, We are writing to urge you to prioritize democratic scrutiny of any proposed changes to UK surveillance laws.

I have concerns about the lack of democratic oversight regarding UK law changes that impact privacy rights, especially those connected to EU law. Because of this, I joined others in signing an open letter to MPs. This letter was published in the Guardian and other publications. I want to recognize Andrew Murray and Paul Bernal for leading this effort.
This is the complete letter to all members of the House of Commons:..<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/dear-uk-members-of-parliament-we-are-writing-to-urge-you-to-prioritize-democratic-scrutiny-of-any-proposed-changes-to-uk-surveillance-laws-thank-you/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/dear-uk-members-of-parliament-we-are-writing-to-urge-you-to-prioritize-democratic-scrutiny-of-any-proposed-changes-to-uk-surveillance-laws-thank-you/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Should legitimacy be prioritized in the further development of the EMU, or should it be considered as a secondary concern?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/should-legitimacy-be-prioritized-in-the-further-development-of-the-emu-or-should-it-be-considered-as-a-secondary-concern/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 May 2023 16:56:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/should-legitimacy-be-prioritized-in-the-further-development-of-the-emu-or-should-it-be-considered-as-a-secondary-concern/</guid><description>PÃ¤ivi Leino-Sandberg: Adjunct Professor of EU Law, Academy of Finland Research Fellow, University of Helsinki
In June 2012, the European Council outlined &amp;ldquo;four essential building blocks&amp;rdquo; for the future of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU): integrated frameworks for finance, budget, and economic policy, and enhanced democratic legitimacy and accountability. The European Council emphasized ensuring democratic legitimacy and accountability at all levels of decision-making and implementation, stating that stronger economic governance requires stronger legitimacy and accountability...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/should-legitimacy-be-prioritized-in-the-further-development-of-the-emu-or-should-it-be-considered-as-a-secondary-concern/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/should-legitimacy-be-prioritized-in-the-further-development-of-the-emu-or-should-it-be-considered-as-a-secondary-concern/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Is it possible for Thomas Piketty to bring about reform in both capitalism and democracy within the European Union?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-possible-for-thomas-piketty-to-bring-about-reform-in-both-capitalism-and-democracy-within-the-european-union/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Sep 2022 02:08:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-possible-for-thomas-piketty-to-bring-about-reform-in-both-capitalism-and-democracy-within-the-european-union/</guid><description>Steve Peers
French economist Thomas Piketty unexpectedly became a prominent intellectual figure, especially in the UK and US, with his book &amp;ldquo;Capital,&amp;rdquo; which presents a new perspective on the relationship between capitalism and democracy.
Maintaining his engagement with current issues, Piketty has contributed to a proposal for EU reform, connecting his academic work to practical solutions.

In June 2015, the leaders of the EU and Euro area institutions released a report outlining a plan for strengthening and finalizing the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). This report, based on crisis-combatting measures, offers numerous suggestions for improving the EMU&amp;rsquo;s governance and deepening economic integration within the Euro area.
