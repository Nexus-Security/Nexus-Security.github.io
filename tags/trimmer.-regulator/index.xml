This post covers the last board requiring capacitor replacements: the Tone Control &amp;amp; FM Tuning Board. Replacing the ten capacitors on this board is straightforward due to their accessibility. The true challenge lies in cleaning and fixing the three slider controls: Bass, Treble, and Balance.

Despite the Beomaster 1900 and 2400 receivers having a small footprint, their restoration is deceptively complex. Replacing the numerous capacitors always serves as a reminder of the intricate internal workings.
Upon arrival, the main board appeared as shown:
After replacing the electrolytic and tantalum capacitors, the main board looked like this:
Here&amp;rsquo;s a closer look:
Following my usual practice, I replaced electrolytic and tantalum capacitors with values of 4...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-pair-of-beomaster-1900-receivers-for-restoration-recapping-the-main-board-and-volume-control-board-unit-1-/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-pair-of-beomaster-1900-receivers-for-restoration-recapping-the-main-board-and-volume-control-board-unit-1-/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
