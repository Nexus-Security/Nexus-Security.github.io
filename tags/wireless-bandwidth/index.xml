Think of WiMAX as a city-wide hotspot, similar to 3G cellular broadband. It&amp;rsquo;s more than just a powerful WiFi; it&amp;rsquo;s a broadband service covering a much larger area, even inside buildings and vehicles. Watch this video for a closer look at WiMAX.
WiMAX is a robust wireless standard gaining global traction for providing wireless broadband access to stationary and mobile devices. In numerous US cities, WiMAX utilizes old analog TV channels auctioned off recently...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-s-the-difference-between-wimax-and-wifi/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-s-the-difference-between-wimax-and-wifi/</a></p></description></item><item><title>WiMAX 2 Will Challenge Fiber For Speed</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/wimax-2-will-challenge-fiber-for-speed/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jul 2023 16:29:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/wimax-2-will-challenge-fiber-for-speed/</guid><description>The idea that copper and wireless technologies are outdated in terms of bandwidth is circulating. While copper has found new life as a last-mile solution for Metro Ethernet services, and wireless stands out for its unmatched mobility, a new wireless technology is emerging that might surpass even fiber optic speeds.
It&amp;rsquo;s surprising to think that wireless could outpace fiber in terms of bandwidth.
While not all fiber optic services offer top speeds of 10 GigE, with many customers receiving 50 to 100 Mbps, especially in the case of Fiber To The Home (FTTH), the prospect of achieving 100 to 300 Mbps wirelessly anywhere in a city is enticing...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/wimax-2-will-challenge-fiber-for-speed/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/wimax-2-will-challenge-fiber-for-speed/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
