The most fundamental of these is IaaS, which forms the basis for the other two. IaaS essentially refers to providing basic hardware and operating system software over the internet.
Infrastructure is fairly self-explanatory: it&amp;rsquo;s the foundational hardware and software needed for computing. When considering cloud infrastructure, the comparison is often made with having your own data center.</description></item><item><title>Fiber Is The New Infrastructure</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/fiber-is-the-new-infrastructure/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2024 15:10:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/fiber-is-the-new-infrastructure/</guid><description>The current focus on infrastructure often overlooks a critical element: fiber optic broadband. While roads, bridges, and utilities are essential, fiber optic networks are the backbone of the 21st-century economy. Just as electricity revolutionized the 20th century, fiber optics will define this one.

It&amp;rsquo;s time for businesses to switch from traditional wireline internet to fiber optic service. You might be surprised how accessible and affordable fiber internet has become.
Fiber Optic Internet: What&amp;rsquo;s New?
A decade ago, fiber optic internet was only for large corporations due to its high cost. The service, primarily offered by major telephone companies, was limited in availability and very expensive.
This has changed drastically. Today, Ethernet has become the most popular fiber optic service, with prices comparable to older T1 or T3 lines while offering significantly more bandwidth.</description></item><item><title>Five Ways to Squeeze More ROI Out of Your Server Room</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/five-ways-to-squeeze-more-roi-out-of-your-server-room/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2024 19:22:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/five-ways-to-squeeze-more-roi-out-of-your-server-room/</guid><description>Servers are crucial for modern businesses as they manage internal and external data.
