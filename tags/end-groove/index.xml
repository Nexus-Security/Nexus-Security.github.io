One peculiar problem was a detached carriage position sensor, which is housed within a black light shield. This shield was hanging at an angle, but it needs to be positioned vertically. The sensor works by using black sections on a plexiglass strip attached to the carriage to interrupt light from an IR diode. If the sensor is misaligned, stray light can disrupt the carriage&amp;rsquo;s movement...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-non-working-end-groove-detection-repair-of-a-detached-carriage-position-sensor/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-non-working-end-groove-detection-repair-of-a-detached-carriage-position-sensor/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: End Groove Detection Issue</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-end-groove-detection-issue/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Apr 2023 17:24:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-end-groove-detection-issue/</guid><description>Following the hood polishing, I believed my work on this Beogram 4000 was complete, but I was mistaken. A final functionality test before packing revealed a peculiar issue. When the ON button was pressed without a record on the platter, the carriage would move inward as expected, but then halt abruptly before reaching the end switch (ES). Pressing FF would release it, but the carriage would instantly retract without contacting the ES...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-end-groove-detection-issue/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-end-groove-detection-issue/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): End Groove Detection Not Working</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-end-groove-detection-not-working/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Oct 2022 16:56:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-end-groove-detection-not-working/</guid><description>Just when I thought I had finished refurbishing a Beogram 4002 (5513) turntable, a problem surfaced during playback. The tonearm wouldn&amp;rsquo;t return after playing a record, instead getting stuck in the end groove, repeating the sound of the run-out.
Investigating further, I used an oscilloscope to examine the signal from the position sensor, which tells the control system the tonearm&amp;rsquo;s location. The signal was weak specifically in the end groove area, often indicating misalignment between the sensor&amp;rsquo;s IR diode and the light entry slit...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-end-groove-detection-not-working/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-end-groove-detection-not-working/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: An Entertaining Evening Exploring the Differential Stop Circuit</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-an-entertaining-evening-exploring-the-differential-stop-circuit/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jun 2022 15:49:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-an-entertaining-evening-exploring-the-differential-stop-circuit/</guid><description>Before returning a refurbished unit to a customer, we put it through rigorous real-world testing. This involves playing music for several weeks to ensure consistent functionality. This listening process is a delightful part of working with Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen equipment, as our workshop is always filled with music! A recent case involving a restored Beogram 4000 turntable highlights the value of this testing phase.
During playback, I noticed the arm occasionally failed to return to its resting position after reaching the record&amp;rsquo;s end...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-an-entertaining-evening-exploring-the-differential-stop-circuit/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-an-entertaining-evening-exploring-the-differential-stop-circuit/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5501): Random Stop Issue Fixed - Defective Photo Resistor in the Spindle RPM Sensor</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5501-random-stop-issue-fixed-defective-photo-resistor-in-the-spindle-rpm-sensor/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jun 2022 05:32:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5501-random-stop-issue-fixed-defective-photo-resistor-in-the-spindle-rpm-sensor/</guid><description>A Beogram 4002 (5501) turntable, previously restored, began experiencing a problem where the OFF function would randomly activate during playback as if the button was pressed.
Prior to delving into the solution, the circuit diagram is presented for reference.
Transistor TR17, within the &amp;lsquo;Electronic Switch&amp;rsquo; section, is responsible for initiating the turntable&amp;rsquo;s OFF function. When its base is grounded, the collector rises to approximately 18V, causing the arm to lift and return to its resting position...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5501-random-stop-issue-fixed-defective-photo-resistor-in-the-spindle-rpm-sensor/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5501-random-stop-issue-fixed-defective-photo-resistor-in-the-spindle-rpm-sensor/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
