The power supply wasn&amp;rsquo;t functioning correctly, and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t getting +24 VDC at capacitor C1. Initially, I suspected the rectifier board, so I removed it to inspect the supply capacitors (C1, C2, and C3).
Here are the readings for capacitors C1 through C3.
To further diagnose the problem, I swapped components from other Beocord 9000 units I had available.</description></item><item><title>A Pair of Beomaster 1900 Receivers for Restoration: Unit #1 Power Restored</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-pair-of-beomaster-1900-receivers-for-restoration-unit-1-power-restored/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jun 2023 09:30:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-pair-of-beomaster-1900-receivers-for-restoration-unit-1-power-restored/</guid><description>The first Beomaster 1900 unit is ready for testing after restoration. Testing always starts with powering it on and checking the voltages.
This Beomaster wasn&amp;rsquo;t powering on. Based on my previous observations, I suspected the +15 VDC fuse and the fuse holders. I also found a wire exposed on the main power switch.
I repaired the power switch wiring. The Beomaster 1900 has a secure yet easily accessible wire connection for the line voltage.</description></item><item><title>A Pair of Beomaster 1900 Receivers for Restoration: Unit #1 Reassembly for Testing and a Power Problem</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-pair-of-beomaster-1900-receivers-for-restoration-unit-1-reassembly-for-testing-and-a-power-problem/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jul 2022 04:33:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-pair-of-beomaster-1900-receivers-for-restoration-unit-1-reassembly-for-testing-and-a-power-problem/</guid><description>Before testing the Beomaster 1900, I needed to reinstall its four output transistors, which are located on the rear heatsinks. I had previously removed the heatsinks and their old thermal paste. For this reassembly, I prefer using modern SIL-Pad thermal insulators. They are much cleaner to work with than thermal paste and provide excellent thermal transfer.
Here are the components prepped for reassembly.
Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen designed a clever mounting system for these transistors.</description></item></channel></rss>
