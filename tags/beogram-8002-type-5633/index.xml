I prefer working on the same type of audio equipment consecutively because it minimizes workbench setup time.
The owner followed our packing advice and packaged the turntable very well, using double boxes and protective foam. The turntable arrived without damage.
Upon opening, I noticed the metal tonearm lid wouldn&amp;rsquo;t stay up. The part that connects to the hinge with damping grease was detached, a problem I haven&amp;rsquo;t encountered before...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/bay-area-beogram-8002-initial-assessment/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/bay-area-beogram-8002-initial-assessment/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Bay Area Beogram 8002: Cabinet Work Completion to First Record Play</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/bay-area-beogram-8002-cabinet-work-completion-to-first-record-play/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Mar 2024 04:11:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/bay-area-beogram-8002-cabinet-work-completion-to-first-record-play/</guid><description>I finally set up the Beogram 8002 turntable in a listening room to test its functionality.
While reassembly took a bit longer than expected due to a slight detour to repair chipped rosewood trim on the front panel.
Although fixing the trim wasn&amp;rsquo;t part of the initial restoration plan, I decided against leaving the front panel chipped.
Repairs involving glue, like this one, often take longer than expected due to the curing time...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/bay-area-beogram-8002-cabinet-work-completion-to-first-record-play/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/bay-area-beogram-8002-cabinet-work-completion-to-first-record-play/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Bay Area Beogram 8002: Some cabinet work</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/bay-area-beogram-8002-some-cabinet-work/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 05:22:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/bay-area-beogram-8002-some-cabinet-work/</guid><description>The Beogram 8002&amp;rsquo;s internal components are ready to be placed back into the cabinet, but the cabinet needs some attention first.
While this Beogram&amp;rsquo;s cabinet is in good condition overall, there are a few things that need to be fixed, as mentioned in the initial assessment (linked in the original text).
The first step was to remove the aluminum deck lid. The previous re-attachment used overly thick double-sided tape that created too much space...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/bay-area-beogram-8002-some-cabinet-work/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/bay-area-beogram-8002-some-cabinet-work/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Bay Area Beogram 8002: Checking the Forward/Reverse Scanning LDR Devices</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/bay-area-beogram-8002-checking-the-forwardreverse-scanning-ldr-devices/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Aug 2023 01:45:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/bay-area-beogram-8002-checking-the-forwardreverse-scanning-ldr-devices/</guid><description>My previous work on this Beogram left me concerned about a potential issue with one of the forward/reverse scanning LDRs (Light Dependent Resistors).
Testing the resistance of both LDRs with +15 VDC on the light source, I noticed a significant difference between them, leading me to believe one was faulty. However, upon removing and re-testing them, the resistance values were much closer.
It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that my testing method involved a simple setup with an LED work light as a light source...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/bay-area-beogram-8002-checking-the-forwardreverse-scanning-ldr-devices/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/bay-area-beogram-8002-checking-the-forwardreverse-scanning-ldr-devices/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Bay Area Beogram 8002: Capacitor Replacement</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/bay-area-beogram-8002-capacitor-replacement/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Aug 2022 18:57:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/bay-area-beogram-8002-capacitor-replacement/</guid><description>In this Beogram 8002 turntable restoration, I began by replacing the capacitors and the phono muting relay.
I started with the two electrolytic capacitors on the floating chassis, which are part of the +5 VDC power supply regulation. I replaced them with WIMA MKS capacitors (for values 4.7uF and under) and high-quality Japanese 105Â°C electrolytic capacitors (for values over 4.7uF).
The old muting relay was replaced with a fully sealed Omron relay...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/bay-area-beogram-8002-capacitor-replacement/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/bay-area-beogram-8002-capacitor-replacement/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Bay Area Beogram 8002: Trying Out the Restored Components</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/bay-area-beogram-8002-trying-out-the-restored-components/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Aug 2022 18:16:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/bay-area-beogram-8002-trying-out-the-restored-components/</guid><description>Following the capacitor replacement from the last update, a test connector was added to make it easier to work with the scanning LDRs. The button control panel was removed from its circuit board, revealing a typical amount of dust accumulation, which was easily wiped away. The test connector was soldered on, and the button panel was reassembled.
Another task involved cleaning and lubricating the tangential arm assembly. The drive spindle and nut were in good condition...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/bay-area-beogram-8002-trying-out-the-restored-components/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/bay-area-beogram-8002-trying-out-the-restored-components/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Bay Area Beogram 8002: Service Manual Adjustments and Record Play Test</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/bay-area-beogram-8002-service-manual-adjustments-and-record-play-test/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jul 2022 14:48:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/bay-area-beogram-8002-service-manual-adjustments-and-record-play-test/</guid><description>To complete the remaining service manual adjustments, the platter motor connector needs to be disconnected for both the tracking force and tracking sensor adjustments.
To adjust the tracking force, an MMC phono cartridge is required, and it&amp;rsquo;s recommended to set the sliding tracking force knob to 1 gram.
With the platter motor disconnected, the tonearm can be placed over the stationary platter. A tracking force scale is used to measure the cartridge&amp;rsquo;s tracking force, aiming for a reading of 1 gram...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/bay-area-beogram-8002-service-manual-adjustments-and-record-play-test/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/bay-area-beogram-8002-service-manual-adjustments-and-record-play-test/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Bay Area Beogram 8002: Oscilloscope Measurements</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/bay-area-beogram-8002-oscilloscope-measurements/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jun 2022 02:13:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/bay-area-beogram-8002-oscilloscope-measurements/</guid><description>This document summarizes the functional testing performed on a Beogram 8002 turntable, using oscilloscope captures of critical signals as a reference for comparison with other Beogram 8002 turntables.
The testing involved connecting test leads to six key points on the Beogram 8002&amp;rsquo;s main board: Position Sensor 1, Position Sensor 2, Detector Arm, Speed Sensor, Servo Motor Forward, and Servo Motor Reverse. Due to the oscilloscope&amp;rsquo;s four-channel limitation, the initial focus was on the servo motor and position sensors...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/bay-area-beogram-8002-oscilloscope-measurements/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/bay-area-beogram-8002-oscilloscope-measurements/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
