AISense, a company based in the US, has introduced Otter, an application that uses GPU technology to record and transcribe speech from multiple speakers. Unlike most currently available software that needs to be trained on a single voice, Otter can accurately recognize and differentiate between various speakers.
Sam Liang, AISense co-founder and CEO, highlights in aÂ blog post that capturing human-to-human interactions is significantly more challenging than interactions like those with virtual assistants like Alexa, Siri, or Google Assistant.</description></item></channel></rss>
