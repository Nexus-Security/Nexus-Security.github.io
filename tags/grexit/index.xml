Greece&amp;rsquo;s upcoming referendum on accepting its creditors&amp;rsquo; offer brings uncertainty. It&amp;rsquo;s unclear if rejecting the offer means Greece automatically leaves the EU or EMU, or defaults on its debt. Accepting the offer doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide clarity either, as negotiations were ongoing during the referendum announcement, potentially making the offer outdated.
Given the range of possibilities, examining the legal framework for departing economic and monetary union (EMU) is crucial. A key question is whether Greece must leave the EU if it exits the single currency...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-are-the-legal-implications-of-leaving-the-economic-and-monetary-union-according-to-eu-law/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-are-the-legal-implications-of-leaving-the-economic-and-monetary-union-according-to-eu-law/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Is it possible for Greece to be expelled from the eurozone?

The European Central Bank&amp;rsquo;s (ECB) actions regarding Greece, particularly since Syriza&amp;rsquo;s political victory, have drawn considerable criticism. This piece examines the gradual tightening of Greece&amp;rsquo;s financial situation within the framework of ECB regulations and considers potential outcomes if a resolution for Greece&amp;rsquo;s urgent funding requirements isn&amp;rsquo;t reached by June 2015.
ECB Halts Greek Government Bonds as Collateral
Since accepting its initial bailout in 2010, Greece has largely been unable to secure funding from markets except through domestic T-Bill issuances...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-possible-for-greece-to-be-expelled-from-the-eurozone-how-will-the-ecb-s-actions-in-limiting-funding-options-for-greece-impact-target2/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-possible-for-greece-to-be-expelled-from-the-eurozone-how-will-the-ecb-s-actions-in-limiting-funding-options-for-greece-impact-target2/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The European citizens' initiative and the EU's authority regarding Greek debt restructuring.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-european-citizens-initiative-and-the-eu-s-authority-regarding-greek-debt-restructuring/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Nov 2022 12:31:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-european-citizens-initiative-and-the-eu-s-authority-regarding-greek-debt-restructuring/</guid><description>Professor Daniel Sarmiento, Professor of EU Law at the University Complutense of Madrid*
Determining the European Union&amp;rsquo;s legal authority is a sensitive and increasingly complex area of EU law. This complexity is compounded by the intricate body of case law on legal bases, making it difficult to navigate even after decades of precedents. Since the Lisbon Treaty&amp;rsquo;s enactment, EU competency has become a significant area of focus for EU constitutional lawyers, requiring meticulous attention...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-european-citizens-initiative-and-the-eu-s-authority-regarding-greek-debt-restructuring/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-european-citizens-initiative-and-the-eu-s-authority-regarding-greek-debt-restructuring/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Can a temporary Grexit be legally feasible?

News sources report that during the recent Eurogroup meeting about a potential new bailout plan for Greece, the German government was privately proposing a plan for a temporary Greek exit from the eurozone (&amp;ldquo;Grexit&amp;rdquo;). Putting aside any political or economic arguments, the most pressing question is whether this is even legally feasible. The short answer: It&amp;rsquo;s not.
A temporary Grexit isn&amp;rsquo;t possible because a permanent one isn&amp;rsquo;t allowed under the current treaties...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/can-a-temporary-grexit-be-legally-feasible-emu-like-the-hotel-california/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/can-a-temporary-grexit-be-legally-feasible-emu-like-the-hotel-california/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Challenging the legality of ECB restrictions on Greek bank accounts – and ways you can support the cause</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/challenging-the-legality-of-ecb-restrictions-on-greek-bank-accounts-and-ways-you-can-support-the-cause/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jun 2022 07:08:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/challenging-the-legality-of-ecb-restrictions-on-greek-bank-accounts-and-ways-you-can-support-the-cause/</guid><description>Steve Peers
Many citizens across the EU have observed the plight of Greeks limited to €60 withdrawals per day with sympathy and apprehension. This situation stems from the European Central Bank (ECB) restricting emergency funds for Greek banks.
Beyond the human cost, the ECB&amp;rsquo;s actions raise serious legal, political, and economic concerns. A core function of any central bank is acting as a last-resort lender for banks, a role the ECB is demonstrably failing to fulfill in this case...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/challenging-the-legality-of-ecb-restrictions-on-greek-bank-accounts-and-ways-you-can-support-the-cause/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/challenging-the-legality-of-ecb-restrictions-on-greek-bank-accounts-and-ways-you-can-support-the-cause/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
