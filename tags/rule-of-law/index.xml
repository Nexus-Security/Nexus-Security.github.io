As an EU law and human rights professor for over two decades, the topic of sanctioning Member States for human rights violations was once straightforward. The enforcement procedure (Article 7 TEU) was never used, making in-depth discussions unnecessary. My focus remained on practical issues like arrest warrants and asylum seekers.
However, the landscape has shifted. Like Article 50, which also addresses the EU&amp;rsquo;s relationship with Member States, Article 7 seems hastily drafted without considering its practical application, possibly because its creators never anticipated its use.</description></item><item><title>The request for a preliminary ruling from the Polish Supreme Court on 2 August 2018 and its implications for the rule of law in Poland: A commentary on the CJEU's involvement.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-request-for-a-preliminary-ruling-from-the-polish-supreme-court-on-2-august-2018-and-its-implications-for-the-rule-of-law-in-poland-a-commentary-on-the-cjeu-s-involvement/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2024 23:00:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-request-for-a-preliminary-ruling-from-the-polish-supreme-court-on-2-august-2018-and-its-implications-for-the-rule-of-law-in-poland-a-commentary-on-the-cjeu-s-involvement/</guid><description>Alicja Sikora, Chair EU Law, Jagiellonian University
As the playwright Eugene Ionesco once said, predictions are only possible after events have occurred.
Last Thursday, the Polish Supreme Court presented the European Court of Justice with a request for a preliminary ruling. This type of request, outlined in Article 267 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, is used to clarify questions regarding EU law. In doing so, the Polish court also paused the enforcement of a Polish law mandating early retirement for Supreme Court justices over 65.</description></item><item><title>Part 2: Should the EU impose sanctions on its Member States for violations of the rule of law and human rights under ordinary EU law?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/part-2-should-the-eu-impose-sanctions-on-its-member-states-for-violations-of-the-rule-of-law-and-human-rights-under-ordinary-eu-law/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Feb 2024 16:11:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/part-2-should-the-eu-impose-sanctions-on-its-member-states-for-violations-of-the-rule-of-law-and-human-rights-under-ordinary-eu-law/</guid><description>Professor Steve Peers, University of Essex
Can the EU penalize its member states for consistently violating human rights and the rule of law? And if so, how?
This article, the second in a three-part series, explores this question. The first installment analyzed the official mechanism designed for this purpose: Article 7 TEU. As previously discussed, this process, which could result in the suspension of certain EU membership rights for a member state, is highly political, offers limited involvement from EU courts, and is challenging to implement.</description></item><item><title>The CJEU issues its first ruling on interim measures regarding the rule of law in Poland.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-issues-its-first-ruling-on-interim-measures-regarding-the-rule-of-law-in-poland/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Dec 2023 06:10:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-issues-its-first-ruling-on-interim-measures-regarding-the-rule-of-law-in-poland/</guid><description>Daniel Sarmiento, Professor of EU Law at the University Complutense of Madrid*
The October 19th decision by the Vice-President of the Court of Justice concerning Poland&amp;rsquo;s Judiciary Reform Act is groundbreaking. This decision, which orders Poland to halt the implementation of the Act and prevents the removal of judges due to the new retirement age, represents uncharted territory. It places the Court of Justice in the unprecedented position of compelling a sovereign member state to decide between adhering to European integration principles or embracing illiberalism.</description></item><item><title>Going from bad to worse?

Despite being an EU member for fifteen years, Maltese courts have been hesitant to refer legal interpretation questions to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). This could change with a case that has significant implications for the direct effect of EU member states&amp;rsquo; rule of law and human rights obligations. This legal challenge raises new and critical questions about democratizing EU constitutional law, similar to how the internal market law was democratized through the Van Gend case.</description></item><item><title>Should safeguarding the rule of law in the EU be the responsibility of the Commission?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/should-safeguarding-the-rule-of-law-in-the-eu-be-the-responsibility-of-the-commission/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jun 2023 21:22:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/should-safeguarding-the-rule-of-law-in-the-eu-be-the-responsibility-of-the-commission/</guid><description>Steve Peers
Concerns about upholding the rule of law within the European Union have arisen lately, particularly regarding government actions in Hungary and Romania. Currently, the EU can address breaches of EU law and penalize severe, ongoing violations of EU values, including rule of law. However, there&amp;rsquo;s no mechanism to handle potential EU value breaches not directly tied to EU law or not reaching the threshold of a serious persistent breach.</description></item><item><title>Dear Colleague, Do You Possess Sufficient Independence?

Advocate General Tanchev recently presented his opinion on case C-216/18 PPU. This case involves multiple European Arrest Warrants (EAWs) issued by Polish authorities against an individual, LM, suspected of drug trafficking. The case, brought before the European Court of Justice (ECJ) by the Irish High Court, questions whether an EAW is enforceable if the issuing Member State&amp;rsquo;s conditions contradict the fundamental right to a fair trial due to systemic rule of law issues within its justice system.</description></item><item><title>Is Poland violating the principle of effective judicial protection?

While the Court of Justice plays a significant role in enforcing EU law through infringement and preliminary ruling procedures (Articles 258 and 267 TFEU, respectively), it has largely been excluded from enforcing EU values, particularly the rule of law. The EU Treaties lack explicit provisions granting the Court of Justice the power to address rule of law breaches by Member States.</description></item><item><title>Is this the start of the downfall of Poland's controversial "judicial reforms"?

These changes include lowering the retirement age for judges on the country&amp;rsquo;s highest court. This move has been presented by the government as a necessary reform to hold accountable judges who were supposedly involved in the country&amp;rsquo;s previous communist regime, even though that regime ended three decades ago.</description></item><item><title>Is the CJEU judgment in LM a new era for mutual trust and independence of the judiciary, or just business as usual?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-cjeu-judgment-in-lm-a-new-era-for-mutual-trust-and-independence-of-the-judiciary-or-just-business-as-usual/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Oct 2022 23:01:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-cjeu-judgment-in-lm-a-new-era-for-mutual-trust-and-independence-of-the-judiciary-or-just-business-as-usual/</guid><description>Dr. Agnieszka Frąckowiak-Adamska, Faculty of Law, University of Wroclaw
In the case of C-216/18 PPU LM, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) was asked by an Irish court to consider a significant legal issue facing the EU: how restrictions on judicial independence in one member state impact other EU member states. A series of laws enacted in Poland from 2015 to 2018 has been widely criticized by numerous institutions, both within and outside Poland, for enabling legislative and executive branches to significantly interfere with the judicial process.</description></item><item><title>Is it possible for a Member State to be expelled or suspended from the EU?

The re-election of Hungary&amp;rsquo;s Orban government has led some critics to demand Hungary&amp;rsquo;s expulsion from the EU. This raises questions about the possibility of such an action and the available sanctions the EU can impose on its members.

The proposed structure and roles within the next European Commission, particularly regarding Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) issues, carry significant implications for EU policy. However, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to remember that the European Parliament (EP) can still influence the final list of Commissioners, as seen in previous years.

Contrary to some claims, the new Commission retains a dedicated Commissioner for immigration and home affairs, a position filled by Dimitris Avramopolous.</description></item></channel></rss>
