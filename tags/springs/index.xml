A correctly aligned platter sits flush with these panels, allowing the black &amp;lsquo;ribs&amp;rsquo; to stand out against a flat aluminum surface. Achieving this alignment is intricate, requiring several parameters to be perfectly adjusted. I&amp;rsquo;ve observed that a sensor arm that isn&amp;rsquo;t entirely parallel to the floating chassis often complicates this process. Both the service manual and my videos detail an adjustment procedure assuming the sensor arm&amp;rsquo;s parallelism.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): A New Arrival on Beolover's Bench</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-a-new-arrival-on-beolovers-bench/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Sep 2023 06:33:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-a-new-arrival-on-beolovers-bench/</guid><description>During the holiday season, I received another Beogram 4002 (5513) turntable for repair. My initial assessment showed that it was packaged very well, with some innovative methods used to protect it during shipping.
The dust cover was secured using soft foam blocks to hold the sub-platter and the RPM panel in place.
The MMC20E cartridge was also protected by foam and arrived in good condition.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the cartridge after unpacking:</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5523): A Second Beogram 4002 (5523) Arrived for some TLC - First Impressions</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5523-a-second-beogram-4002-5523-arrived-for-some-tlc-first-impressions/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 May 2023 20:40:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5523-a-second-beogram-4002-5523-arrived-for-some-tlc-first-impressions/</guid><description>A Beogram 4002 (5523) in need of restoration arrived with its MMC4000 cartridge still attached and transport locks disengaged, causing initial concern about potential damage. The foam meant to support the tonearm had deteriorated, leaving it to swing freely.
Fortunately, the cartridge appeared undamaged, likely due to the tonearm&amp;rsquo;s light weight and protective tape. Testing on a restored Beogram 4000 confirmed its functionality.
The hood was in good condition, showing only minor scratches and signs of polishing.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Installation of a New Gold Coated DIN5 Plug and a Grounding Switch</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-installation-of-a-new-gold-coated-din5-plug-and-a-grounding-switch/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Mar 2023 09:02:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-installation-of-a-new-gold-coated-din5-plug-and-a-grounding-switch/</guid><description>My restoration of the Beogram 4000 is progressing well. I&amp;rsquo;ve added a grounding switch and a new gold-plated Neutrik DIN5 plug. The switch allows users to choose between the grounding setup of the older 4000/4002 models (separate signal and system grounds) and the later 4004 models (combined grounds). This option helps prevent ground loops and the resulting humming, depending on the amplifier being used. I wrote a detailed post on this topic a while back.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Adjusting the Chassis Springs and the Platter Height</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-adjusting-the-chassis-springs-and-the-platter-height/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Dec 2022 03:25:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-adjusting-the-chassis-springs-and-the-platter-height/</guid><description>The Beogram 4000 restoration is progressing into the final cosmetic stage. With the turntable functioning correctly, the focus is now on refining the exterior and replacing minor parts like the plug. Currently, I am fine-tuning the platter height, tilt, and the leaf springs supporting the turntable&amp;rsquo;s floating chassis. This is a delicate process with many interconnected factors. The sensor arm&amp;rsquo;s alignment, platter angle, transport lock travel, and belt tension all need to be perfect for the platter to be level, centered, and parallel to the arms, all while ensuring the chassis clears the open locks.</description></item></channel></rss>
