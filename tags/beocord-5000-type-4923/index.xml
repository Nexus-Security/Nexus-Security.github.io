This post covers the completion of those tasks.
The original power supply capacitors are shown below.
&amp;hellip;and the replacement capacitors are here.
Next up are the belts.
First is the tape counter belt.
Now for the clutch wheel and flywheel belts. Replacing these requires disassembling some brackets...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-5000-type-4923-new-power-supply-capacitors-and-belts/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-5000-type-4923-new-power-supply-capacitors-and-belts/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beocord 5000 Type 4923: Initial assessment of another Beosystem 5000 companion component.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-5000-type-4923-initial-assessment-of-another-beosystem-5000-companion-component/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Mar 2024 23:37:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-5000-type-4923-initial-assessment-of-another-beosystem-5000-companion-component/</guid><description>This Beocord 5000 is the second cassette deck from Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen to bear this name. The original Beocord 5000, a Type 47xx model, was manufactured in the late 1970s. While distinct, both are high-quality cassette decks.

The Beocord 5000 Type 4923 aligns with the Beomaster 5000 Type 2323 and the CD50 Beosystem 5000 components in terms of size and design. Control and display access are provided both on the front panel and through a master remote control...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-5000-type-4923-initial-assessment-of-another-beosystem-5000-companion-component/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-5000-type-4923-initial-assessment-of-another-beosystem-5000-companion-component/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beocord 5000 Type 4923: A couple of service manual retests and wrapping up the project</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-5000-type-4923-a-couple-of-service-manual-retests-and-wrapping-up-the-project/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2024 09:06:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-5000-type-4923-a-couple-of-service-manual-retests-and-wrapping-up-the-project/</guid><description>The Beocord 5000 (Type 4923) is performing very well in recording and playback testing. This stage of restoration always highlights the quality of the component. While it lacks auto-reverse and a monitoring tape head, the Beocord 5000 is a high-quality cassette deck with features some users prefer.
The previous post detailed the electrical adjustments outlined in the service manual. These procedures, while not overly complex, necessitate specialized calibration tapes and testing equipment...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-5000-type-4923-a-couple-of-service-manual-retests-and-wrapping-up-the-project/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-5000-type-4923-a-couple-of-service-manual-retests-and-wrapping-up-the-project/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beocord 5000 Type 4923: Tapehead cleaning and playback testing</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-5000-type-4923-tapehead-cleaning-and-playback-testing/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Feb 2023 01:34:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-5000-type-4923-tapehead-cleaning-and-playback-testing/</guid><description>This update on the Beocord 5000 Type 4923 focuses on mechanical adjustments and tape head maintenance.
The post begins by addressing the sluggish opening and closing of the cassette drawer. While the belt had been replaced, the issue was traced to friction in the drawer slide mechanism. After disassembling and cleaning the mechanism, applying dry lubricant to the metal posts, and reassembling it, the drawer now operates smoothly.
The cassette assembly also underwent a thorough cleaning...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-5000-type-4923-tapehead-cleaning-and-playback-testing/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-5000-type-4923-tapehead-cleaning-and-playback-testing/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beocord 5000 Type 4923: Going over the service manual electrical adjustments</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-5000-type-4923-going-over-the-service-manual-electrical-adjustments/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Feb 2023 22:38:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-5000-type-4923-going-over-the-service-manual-electrical-adjustments/</guid><description>After finishing my previous work on the Beocord 5000 cassette deck, I planned to make some recordings, but realized I needed to perform a full electrical adjustment procedure outlined in the service manual. This process is more time-consuming for two-head decks like this one, as it involves recording, rewinding, and playback for each adjustment.
Let&amp;rsquo;s dive into the adjustments made:
Reference +5 VDC: With the Beocord stopped, I monitored the +5 VDC power supply at a test point and adjusted trimmer 3R24 on the power supply board until it measured +5 VDC...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-5000-type-4923-going-over-the-service-manual-electrical-adjustments/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-5000-type-4923-going-over-the-service-manual-electrical-adjustments/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
