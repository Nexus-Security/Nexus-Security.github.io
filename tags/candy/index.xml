Casa Ferrero, their only Southeast Asian pop-up shop, exudes elegance. The shop&amp;rsquo;s design echoes the gold of the classic Ferrero Rocher praline, enhanced by sparkling crystal chandeliers, the inviting aroma of espresso, and the distinct essence of roasted hazelnuts.
Located outside the Wisma Atria mall along Orchard Road in Singapore, Casa Ferrero is even larger than last year&amp;rsquo;s pop-up, Pasticceria Ferrero.</description></item><item><title>During the festive season, you can find exclusive Ferrero Rocher pralines at Pasticceria Ferrero in Singapore</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/during-the-festive-season-you-can-find-exclusive-ferrero-rocher-pralines-at-pasticceria-ferrero-in-singapore/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Sep 2023 03:07:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/during-the-festive-season-you-can-find-exclusive-ferrero-rocher-pralines-at-pasticceria-ferrero-in-singapore/</guid><description>Celebrities Qi Yu Wu and Joanne Peh are pictured at the event.
