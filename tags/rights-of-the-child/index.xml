Ensuring fair treatment within the criminal justice system is crucial, and this fairness necessitates different safeguards based on individual circumstances. Children, being particularly vulnerable, require special protective measures, as recognized by international standards such as the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Council of Europe Guidelines on child-friendly justice...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/advocating-for-children-the-directive-on-procedural-safeguards-for-children-suspected-or-accused-in-criminal-proceedings/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/advocating-for-children-the-directive-on-procedural-safeguards-for-children-suspected-or-accused-in-criminal-proceedings/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Latest CJEU judgment on family reunion, children's rights, and effective remedies.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/latest-cjeu-judgment-on-family-reunion-children-s-rights-and-effective-remedies/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Sep 2023 07:30:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/latest-cjeu-judgment-on-family-reunion-children-s-rights-and-effective-remedies/</guid><description>Professor Steve Peers, University of Essex
For parents, raising teenagers presents a constant awareness of time&amp;rsquo;s passage. But consider parents separated from their children by the unfeeling nature of immigration policies: missing milestones, first words, and school events. Even when these parents strive to fulfill family reunion requirements, their children may age out of eligibility during the lengthy application process, leaving a profound void.
Family reunification within the EU for non-EU families is primarily governed by the EU Family Reunion Directive, allowing for the admission of children who haven&amp;rsquo;t reached adulthood...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/latest-cjeu-judgment-on-family-reunion-children-s-rights-and-effective-remedies/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/latest-cjeu-judgment-on-family-reunion-children-s-rights-and-effective-remedies/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The case of V.M.A. v Stolichna obshtina, rayon 'Pancharevo' and the rights of rainbow families to freedom of movement.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-case-of-v-m-a-v-stolichna-obshtina-rayon-pancharevo-and-the-rights-of-rainbow-families-to-freedom-of-movement/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Feb 2023 06:27:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-case-of-v-m-a-v-stolichna-obshtina-rayon-pancharevo-and-the-rights-of-rainbow-families-to-freedom-of-movement/</guid><description>Chiara De Capitani, Linguist agent at the European Commission and honorary fellow European Union law at the University of Naples &amp;ldquo;L&amp;rsquo;Orientale&amp;rdquo;.

Defining a &amp;ldquo;family member&amp;rdquo; legally can be complex, especially when it comes to immigration law and child welfare. The recent Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) judgment in the SM case highlights these complexities, particularly where EU free movement law intersects with the family law of non-EU nations...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/guardianship-freedom-of-movement-and-child-rights-the-sm-ruling/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/guardianship-freedom-of-movement-and-child-rights-the-sm-ruling/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Ensuring the right to a nationality for children of same-sex couples in the EU - A crucial matter in the case of V.M.A. v Stolichna Obsthina (C-490/20) before the CJEU.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ensuring-the-right-to-a-nationality-for-children-of-same-sex-couples-in-the-eu-a-crucial-matter-in-the-case-of-v-m-a-v-stolichna-obsthina-c-490-20-before-the-cjeu/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Nov 2022 09:11:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ensuring-the-right-to-a-nationality-for-children-of-same-sex-couples-in-the-eu-a-crucial-matter-in-the-case-of-v-m-a-v-stolichna-obsthina-c-490-20-before-the-cjeu/</guid><description>Patrícia Cabral, Legal Policy Officer, European Network on Statelessness*
The recognition of LGBTQ* rights, including same-sex partnerships or marriages and legal parentage for same-sex couples, varies significantly across Europe. This inconsistent landscape presents challenges for rainbow families (families with at least one LGBTQ* parent), particularly regarding the legal recognition of their civil status, birth registration processes, and access to birth certificates. Consequently, some children in these families face statelessness or a heightened risk of it...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ensuring-the-right-to-a-nationality-for-children-of-same-sex-couples-in-the-eu-a-crucial-matter-in-the-case-of-v-m-a-v-stolichna-obsthina-c-490-20-before-the-cjeu/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ensuring-the-right-to-a-nationality-for-children-of-same-sex-couples-in-the-eu-a-crucial-matter-in-the-case-of-v-m-a-v-stolichna-obsthina-c-490-20-before-the-cjeu/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
