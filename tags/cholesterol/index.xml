Research by Dr. Sirichai Adisakwattana, an Associate Professor at Chulalongkorn University in Thailand, suggests that concentrated extracts from pomelo fruit possess antioxidant properties, which contribute to overall health, and can reduce fat levels.
To reach these findings, Dr. Adisakwattana created powdered concentrates from six varieties of pomelo. His analysis showed that these concentrates could lower both cholesterol and blood lipid levels.
However, due to the fruit&amp;rsquo;s natural sugar content, the university recommends limiting consumption to a small portion each day.</description></item><item><title>Go on a date with some dried fruit</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/go-on-a-date-with-some-dried-fruit/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Feb 2023 20:44:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/go-on-a-date-with-some-dried-fruit/</guid><description>Studies suggest that dates, a popular fruit during Ramadan, could be considered a superfood.
A 2002 study discovered that dates may be effective in combating cancer-causing mutations. In a 2009 study, healthy individuals who consumed 100g of dates daily for four weeks showed remarkable results.
Despite the sugar content of the Hallawi and Medjool dates, their blood sugar levels remained stable. The research also indicated that dates could potentially inhibit plaque buildup in arteries.</description></item><item><title>Improving heart health with cranberry juice</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/improving-heart-health-with-cranberry-juice/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jun 2022 16:28:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/improving-heart-health-with-cranberry-juice/</guid><description>Drinking cranberry juice every day could potentially lead to healthier blood sugar and cholesterol levels, according to recent research.
In a study involving overweight but otherwise healthy participants, those who drank two glasses (450ml) of a cranberry-based beverage daily for two weeks showed improvements in blood sugar stability, reducing spikes and dips often associated with cravings and fatigue. These benefits continued when the two-glass intake was maintained.
After eight weeks of daily consumption, the same cranberry beverage was also linked to higher levels of &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; HDL cholesterol, known for promoting artery health by removing &amp;ldquo;bad&amp;rdquo; cholesterol.</description></item></channel></rss>
