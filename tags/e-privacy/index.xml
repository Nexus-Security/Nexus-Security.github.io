The Advocate General recently issued an opinion on two cases referred by national courts. These cases stem from the Court of Justice of the European Union&amp;rsquo;s (CJEU) decision in Digital Rights Ireland, which invalidated the Data Retention Directive. Both cases examine whether the mass retention of communications data aligns with EU law, raising a critical question: can such broad data retention ever truly comply with human rights?..<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-tele-2-and-watson-case-human-rights-and-national-data-retention-law/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-tele-2-and-watson-case-human-rights-and-national-data-retention-law/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The CJEU provides clarification on police powers in relation to mobile phone theft and EU eprivacy law.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-provides-clarification-on-police-powers-in-relation-to-mobile-phone-theft-and-eu-eprivacy-law/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Oct 2023 11:08:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-provides-clarification-on-police-powers-in-relation-to-mobile-phone-theft-and-eu-eprivacy-law/</guid><description>Lorna Woods, Professor of Internet Law, University of Essex
Introduction
A recent judgment from the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in the case of Ministerio Fiscal contributes to the understanding of the ePrivacy Directive, specifically Article 15, which allows Member States to make exceptions to the confidentiality of communications for certain purposes. This article played a role in the legal framework surrounding the mass retention of communications data from the Digital Rights Ireland case, where the CJEU established that data retention is justified only in cases of &amp;ldquo;serious crime,&amp;rdquo; as per the Tele2/Watson case...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-provides-clarification-on-police-powers-in-relation-to-mobile-phone-theft-and-eu-eprivacy-law/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-provides-clarification-on-police-powers-in-relation-to-mobile-phone-theft-and-eu-eprivacy-law/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Is the new e-Privacy Regulation a threat to human rights?

Introduction
This post follows up on a previous one from last Christmas, which discussed data retention in the context of the proposed Regulation on Privacy and Electronic Communications (e-Privacy Regs). The European Commission released the official version of the e-Privacy Regs on January 10, 2017. Like the leaked version, the official proposal does not have specific provisions for data retention (para 1.3). The proposal allows Member States to maintain or create their own data retention laws...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-new-e-privacy-regulation-a-threat-to-human-rights-exploring-the-implications-of-tele2-and-watson/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-new-e-privacy-regulation-a-threat-to-human-rights-exploring-the-implications-of-tele2-and-watson/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Opinions of the Attorney General on recent CJEU cases regarding national data retention laws</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/opinions-of-the-attorney-general-on-recent-cjeu-cases-regarding-national-data-retention-laws/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 00:53:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/opinions-of-the-attorney-general-on-recent-cjeu-cases-regarding-national-data-retention-laws/</guid><description>Lorna Woods, Professor of Internet Law, University of Essex
Introduction
Advocate General Campos Sanchez-Bordana has presented his opinions on three cases concerning data retention: SpaceNet and Telekom Deutschland, GD v Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, and VD and SR. These opinions are the latest development in a series of legal challenges related to data retention that began with an Irish challenge to the Data Retention Directive.
The Data Retention Directive, which allowed for the retention of communications data under certain exceptions to privacy principles, was invalidated in the Digital Rights Ireland case...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/opinions-of-the-attorney-general-on-recent-cjeu-cases-regarding-national-data-retention-laws/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/opinions-of-the-attorney-general-on-recent-cjeu-cases-regarding-national-data-retention-laws/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The Court of Justice of the European Union makes decisions regarding consent for cookies in accordance with data protection laws.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-court-of-justice-of-the-european-union-makes-decisions-regarding-consent-for-cookies-in-accordance-with-data-protection-laws/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 May 2023 19:09:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-court-of-justice-of-the-european-union-makes-decisions-regarding-consent-for-cookies-in-accordance-with-data-protection-laws/</guid><description>Lorna Woods, Professor of Internet Law, University of Essex
A significant ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) concerning the use of cookies and the interpretation of consent under the e-Privacy Directive was issued last week in the Planet49 case. This ruling holds implications for comprehending cookie requirements under both the existing and forthcoming data protection regulations.

The leak of a draft ePrivacy Regulation on December 12, 2016, has sparked discussions about its implications for data retention. This post will examine this aspect of the draft regulation.
The Article 29 Data Protection Working Party (A29DPWP) had previously advised against introducing new European data retention requirements. This recommendation, reflecting concerns about the existing ePrivacy Directive&amp;rsquo;s allowance for national data retention regimes, is echoed in the leaked draft Regulation...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-an-early-christmas-gift-or-a-disappointment-examining-data-retention-and-the-leaked-eprivacy-regulation/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-an-early-christmas-gift-or-a-disappointment-examining-data-retention-and-the-leaked-eprivacy-regulation/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Regardless of the CJEU's decision, data retention could potentially continue to exist under national law.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/regardless-of-the-cjeu-s-decision-data-retention-could-potentially-continue-to-exist-under-national-law/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jan 2023 07:49:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/regardless-of-the-cjeu-s-decision-data-retention-could-potentially-continue-to-exist-under-national-law/</guid><description>Matthew White, Ph.D candidate, Sheffield Hallam University
A central question regarding internet privacy is whether governments should be allowed to store data about everyone&amp;rsquo;s online and phone activities in the name of fighting terrorism and serious crime. This issue, known as &amp;ldquo;data retention,&amp;rdquo; raises crucial questions about balancing privacy and security, both nationally and within the European Union. Initially, the EU&amp;rsquo;s electronic privacy (e-Privacy) Directive offered member states the choice to implement data retention rules, deviating from the usual rule of communication confidentiality outlined in the directive...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/regardless-of-the-cjeu-s-decision-data-retention-could-potentially-continue-to-exist-under-national-law/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/regardless-of-the-cjeu-s-decision-data-retention-could-potentially-continue-to-exist-under-national-law/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
