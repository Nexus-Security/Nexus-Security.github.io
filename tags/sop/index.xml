This article describes a customization for Dynamics GP that calculates and displays the total weight of a sales order. This is helpful for businesses that ship large or heavy products and need to estimate shipping costs before finalizing an order.
Since Dynamics GP doesn&amp;rsquo;t inherently show the total order weight during order entry, a custom field was created to address this. Accurate inventory item weights are crucial for this customization to be effective.</description></item></channel></rss>
