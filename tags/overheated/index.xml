Upon opening the unit, I discovered the solenoid had completely melted down due to a faulty arm extension I had previously installed. This prevented the solenoid switch from deactivating, leading to overheating and ultimately, failure.
To fix this, I crafted a new solenoid coil and replaced the melted one.</description></item></channel></rss>
