Around the world, the most difficult positions to fill are in skilled trades (particularly chefs, bakers, butchers, mechanics, and electricians), sales, engineering (mechanical, electrical, and civil), technician roles, and drivers (especially heavy vehicle operators), according to workforce experts ManpowerGroup.
The situation in Singapore is somewhat different. While engineers are among the top five hardest roles to fill, as elsewhere, the other four are accounting and finance professionals, sales representatives, secretaries (including receptionists and administrative assistants), and marketing, public relations, and communications specialists.</description></item></channel></rss>
