To prevent damage, I had previously removed the rosewood trim.
The trim is attached to a metal frame that slides in and out to lock and unlock the cabinet. This frame relies on five guide washers, which are commonly broken in Beogram 4002 units. This one was no different. These washers have a unique design, as detailed in a past Beolover blog post.</description></item><item><title>Bay Area Beogram 8002: Cabinet Work Completion to First Record Play</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/bay-area-beogram-8002-cabinet-work-completion-to-first-record-play/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Mar 2024 04:11:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/bay-area-beogram-8002-cabinet-work-completion-to-first-record-play/</guid><description>I finally set up the Beogram 8002 turntable in a listening room to test its functionality.
While reassembly took a bit longer than expected due to a slight detour to repair chipped rosewood trim on the front panel.
Although fixing the trim wasn&amp;rsquo;t part of the initial restoration plan, I decided against leaving the front panel chipped.
Repairs involving glue, like this one, often take longer than expected due to the curing time.</description></item></channel></rss>
