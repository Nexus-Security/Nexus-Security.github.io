Over the past few decades, two primary network technologies have been vying for dominance. The first is the traditional telephone system, which served us well throughout the industrial age. The second is the computer-based architecture that has driven the information age. You might recognize these as circuit switching and packet switching.
While both technologies will likely coexist for a while longer, we are at a turning point. From now on, packet switching will be the dominant force in every network, from copper lines to fiber optic cables to wireless connections...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/circuit-switched-vs-packet-switched-networks/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/circuit-switched-vs-packet-switched-networks/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
