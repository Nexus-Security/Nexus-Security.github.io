Introduction
Celebrating the new European Border and Coast Guard Agency, also known as Frontex, at the Bulgarian external border with Turkey might seem like an odd festivity. However, last Thursday, high-ranking EU and Member State officials gathered at Bulgaria&amp;rsquo;s Kapitan Andreevo Border Checkpoint for this inauguration.

While cellular data is useful in the absence of WiFi, its limited bandwidth and potential for overage charges make it a secondary choice.

WiFi&amp;rsquo;s strength is evident in its ability to not only replace cellular broadband but also wired connections...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/gigabit-wifi-for-video-streaming/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/gigabit-wifi-for-video-streaming/</a></p></description></item><item><title>I Know Where You Took Your Pictures Last Summer</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/i-know-where-you-took-your-pictures-last-summer/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2024 14:53:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/i-know-where-you-took-your-pictures-last-summer/</guid><description>Eye-Fi, the WiFi-enabled memory card, has introduced a new feature: location tagging. Their latest product, Eye-Fi Explore, automatically adds geotags to photos as you take them.
You might be surprised to learn that they haven&amp;rsquo;t actually included a GPS receiver in the small SD card. Instead, it uses a system that determines location based on known WiFi hotspots. This method covers a significant portion of the U.S. population and major metropolitan areas in Europe...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/i-know-where-you-took-your-pictures-last-summer/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/i-know-where-you-took-your-pictures-last-summer/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Internet to Soothe the Savage Flyer</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/internet-to-soothe-the-savage-flyer/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Nov 2023 03:21:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/internet-to-soothe-the-savage-flyer/</guid><description>Is there anything more frustrating than squeezing into the last seat on a long flight, stuck between grumpy passengers with hours to kill?

Although it had a slow start, major airlines like American, Delta, Northwest, and Virgin are now embracing in-flight Wi-Fi.
This shift is inevitable in a society increasingly reliant on technology. We might be giving up old habits, but staying connected online is non-negotiable. Just like hotels and restaurants adapted to this need, airlines are following suit. Passengers are willing to endure cramped conditions and forgo traditional amenities, but internet access is a must-have...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ghost-routers-in-the-sky/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ghost-routers-in-the-sky/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Urgent Information Needed on 'Hotspots' for Asylum Applications</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/urgent-information-needed-on-hotspots-for-asylum-applications/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Oct 2022 14:22:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/urgent-information-needed-on-hotspots-for-asylum-applications/</guid><description>Frances Webber, a lawyer, journalist, and lecturer, holds significant roles as the vice chair of the Institute of Race Relations and as co-editor for prominent legal publications.
