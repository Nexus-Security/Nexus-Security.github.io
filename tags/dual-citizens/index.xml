A fundamental principle within EU law concerning the freedom of movement posits that it primarily pertains to EU citizens residing in a Member State different from their home country. Consequently, EU citizens residing in their own Member State cannot generally invoke this law. However, ECJ case law sometimes permits them to assert rights based on their EU citizenship.
This begs the question: what happens to citizens of two Member States?..<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/clarification-on-dual-citizens-and-eu-citizenship-by-the-ecj/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/clarification-on-dual-citizens-and-eu-citizenship-by-the-ecj/</a></p></description></item><item><title>No Longer Negotiable: The Rights of EU and UK Citizens Post-Brexit</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/no-longer-negotiable-the-rights-of-eu-and-uk-citizens-post-brexit/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2024 04:58:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/no-longer-negotiable-the-rights-of-eu-and-uk-citizens-post-brexit/</guid><description>Steve Peers
Introduction
This post examines the findings of a British Future inquiry into the post-Brexit status of EU citizens in the UK. It outlines the inquiry&amp;rsquo;s key recommendations concerning EU citizens residing in the UK after Brexit, proposes recommendations for UK citizens in the EU after Brexit, and analyzes the concept of &amp;lsquo;associate citizenship&amp;rsquo; for UK citizens post-Brexit. The latter two points, while outside the inquiry&amp;rsquo;s scope, are addressed in parallel...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/no-longer-negotiable-the-rights-of-eu-and-uk-citizens-post-brexit/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/no-longer-negotiable-the-rights-of-eu-and-uk-citizens-post-brexit/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Is this the beginning of the end for citizens' rights in the Brexit 'Sufficient Progress' deal?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-this-the-beginning-of-the-end-for-citizens-rights-in-the-brexit-sufficient-progress-deal/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2024 00:28:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-this-the-beginning-of-the-end-for-citizens-rights-in-the-brexit-sufficient-progress-deal/</guid><description>Professor Steve Peers
The recent joint report on Brexit negotiations, along with accompanying documents, represents an informal agreement to move to the next stage of discussions. This phase will center around a transition period and the framework for the future relationship between the UK and the EU.
Although a political rather than legal document, this report holds significant practical relevance for the withdrawal agreement. It outlines agreed-upon details concerning citizens&amp;rsquo; rights, the Irish border, the financial settlement, and concluding rules...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-this-the-beginning-of-the-end-for-citizens-rights-in-the-brexit-sufficient-progress-deal/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-this-the-beginning-of-the-end-for-citizens-rights-in-the-brexit-sufficient-progress-deal/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Balancing EU free movement regulations with UK border controls</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/balancing-eu-free-movement-regulations-with-uk-border-controls/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 May 2023 14:38:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/balancing-eu-free-movement-regulations-with-uk-border-controls/</guid><description>By Steve Peers
The Advocate-General&amp;rsquo;s recent opinion in the McCarthy case brings up significant issues concerning the reach of EU free movement laws and how they interact with EU and national regulations on border control and visas. The case involves Mr. McCarthy, a dual UK and Irish citizen residing in Spain with his Colombian wife (a third-country national) and their child (also a dual UK and Irish citizen).
The family currently needs to secure a &amp;lsquo;family visa&amp;rsquo; for Mr...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/balancing-eu-free-movement-regulations-with-uk-border-controls/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/balancing-eu-free-movement-regulations-with-uk-border-controls/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
