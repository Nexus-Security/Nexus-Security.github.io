The plexiglass hood had some noticeable scratches:
I began by using 200 grit sandpaper to create a consistent surface:
Then I gradually polished it using Micromesh polishing cloths:

These springs make removing and attaching the hood significantly easier. After consulting the service manuals, it&amp;rsquo;s clear that the Beogram 4000 was not designed with these springs.

These dust covers are remarkable replicas, made with the same die-cast process as the originals, resulting in a seamless finish.
However, a problem arose with this particular dust cover. When closing it, there was slight friction on the hinge approximately halfway through its movement. While I initially dismissed it as an insignificant tolerance issue common in older manufacturing, the issue escalated...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-brand-new-hood-fatally-damaged-due-to-bent-hood-hinges-straightening-hinges-out-and-installation-of-another-hood/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-brand-new-hood-fatally-damaged-due-to-bent-hood-hinges-straightening-hinges-out-and-installation-of-another-hood/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Polishing the Hood</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-polishing-the-hood/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Apr 2023 14:11:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-polishing-the-hood/</guid><description>As a final step in restoring a Beogram 4000 turntable, the author polished its dust cover. This is a multi-step process that can take several hours, especially since this cover had significant damage.
The author began by protecting the Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen logo with layers of insulation tape to prevent accidental sanding. They then used 220-grit sandpaper to smooth out the deep scratches, leaving a surface that resembled wood.
To restore the shine, they progressed through approximately ten grades of sandpaper and micro-mesh polishing cloths, finishing with a polishing liquid...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-polishing-the-hood/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-polishing-the-hood/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Polishing the Hood and a Strange Hinge Pin</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-polishing-the-hood-and-a-strange-hinge-pin/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Mar 2023 12:08:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-polishing-the-hood-and-a-strange-hinge-pin/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m completing the restoration of a Beogram 4000 turntable by addressing the final detail: polishing the dust cover. This one, like many I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered, had scratches from improper storage.
This particular unit had a non-original hinge pin, longer than the original, causing it to protrude. I shortened it, restoring a flush fit. The aluminum trim on the other side had also detached, which I reattached using double-sided tape for easy future removal...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-polishing-the-hood-and-a-strange-hinge-pin/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-polishing-the-hood-and-a-strange-hinge-pin/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beocord 5000 (4715/4716): Polishing of Plexiglass Panel</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-5000-47154716-polishing-of-plexiglass-panel/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Dec 2022 01:15:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-5000-47154716-polishing-of-plexiglass-panel/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m working on restoring another Beocord 5000 (4715/4716) cassette deck, inspired by the resurgence of cassette tapes. It reminds me of the days when creating mixtapes was a way to express affection, unlike simply sharing Spotify playlists today.
I decided to practice polishing a spare Beocord 5000 panel before working on the one for my restoration project.
