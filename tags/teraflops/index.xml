However, as technology advances, even GigaHertz might be surpassed by TeraHertz speeds, potentially rendering current benchmarks obsolete.
In the early days of personal computers, 640 KB of RAM seemed excessive. However, as software evolved, demanding more resources with graphics, images, and the rise of the internet, hardware struggled to keep up. It took decades for platforms to mature and offer sufficient RAM, hard drive space, and processor speeds.</description></item></channel></rss>
