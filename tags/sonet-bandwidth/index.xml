However, accessing these options requires &amp;ldquo;lit&amp;rdquo; fiber service, which can take several months or more due to potential construction delays. So, how do you maintain connectivity in the meantime?
While waiting for fiber activation was once the only option, many carriers now offer a two-stage solution for businesses needing immediate bandwidth.</description></item><item><title>Why Ethernet is Cheaper</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/why-ethernet-is-cheaper/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Aug 2022 19:44:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/why-ethernet-is-cheaper/</guid><description>You probably know that T1 and DS3 lines have become much cheaper in recent years. But for those who need bandwidth of 10 Mbps or more, there&amp;rsquo;s an even better deal: Ethernet.
While you might know Ethernet as a local area network protocol, it&amp;rsquo;s now a wide area network protocol too. This means your carrier can provide an Ethernet connection that plugs directly into your existing network router or switch. You might see it called Ethernet WAN, Metro Ethernet, Carrier Ethernet, or Ethernet Transport.</description></item></channel></rss>
