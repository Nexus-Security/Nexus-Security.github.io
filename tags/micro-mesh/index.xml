This is a multi-step process that can take several hours, especially since this cover had significant damage.
The author began by protecting the Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen logo with layers of insulation tape to prevent accidental sanding. They then used 220-grit sandpaper to smooth out the deep scratches, leaving a surface that resembled wood.
To restore the shine, they progressed through approximately ten grades of sandpaper and micro-mesh polishing cloths, finishing with a polishing liquid.</description></item></channel></rss>
