Research by Dr. Sirichai Adisakwattana, an Associate Professor at Chulalongkorn University in Thailand, suggests that concentrated extracts from pomelo fruit possess antioxidant properties, which contribute to overall health, and can reduce fat levels.
To reach these findings, Dr. Adisakwattana created powdered concentrates from six varieties of pomelo. His analysis showed that these concentrates could lower both cholesterol and blood lipid levels.
However, due to the fruit&amp;rsquo;s natural sugar content, the university recommends limiting consumption to a small portion each day.</description></item></channel></rss>
