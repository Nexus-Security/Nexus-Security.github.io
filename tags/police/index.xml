This advisory comes after a recent raid on a computer vendor in Kembangan Plaza by the Intellectual Property Rights Branch (IPRB) of the Singapore Police Force.
The shop in question had been advertising unauthorized &amp;ldquo;Microsoft license keys&amp;rdquo; as genuine and offering computers bundled with counterfeit software at heavily discounted prices through their online store.</description></item></channel></rss>
