The weight of the hood and the type of screws used put too much stress on the plexiglass, leading to cracks.
The hinge was broken in one place, and the rest of it was still attached, but cracked. After carefully removing the old glue and aluminum strip, the broken piece was glued back on...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-repair-of-cracked-hood-hinge/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-repair-of-cracked-hood-hinge/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): Restoration of a Cracked Hood - Another Process Improvement</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-restoration-of-a-cracked-hood-another-process-improvement/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Apr 2023 15:26:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-restoration-of-a-cracked-hood-another-process-improvement/</guid><description>The Beogram 4002 I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on has a cracked hood around the hinge attachments. The left side was entirely detached, and the right side had a crack extending around one of the holes.
The right side had a crack going all the way around one of the attachment holes:
To begin, I glued the broken pieces back together using Weld-On #4 acrylic solvent. This low-viscosity solvent is ideal for injecting into cracks, as capillary action draws it in...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-restoration-of-a-cracked-hood-another-process-improvement/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-restoration-of-a-cracked-hood-another-process-improvement/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5503): Keyboard Repair - Detached Backstops</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5503-keyboard-repair-detached-backstops/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Apr 2023 11:43:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5503-keyboard-repair-detached-backstops/</guid><description>Following the AC motor hood restoration on a Beogram 4002 (5503), the next cosmetic issue addressed was the loose keypad backstops. Some keys were protruding and functioned erratically, requiring multiple presses.
Upon removing the keypad and its PCB, it was discovered that several plastic backstops had detached. A previous attempt to reattach them using double-sided tape proved unsuccessful, causing an uneven keypad surface.
The remaining backstops were easily removed, but precisely reattaching them posed a challenge...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5503-keyboard-repair-detached-backstops/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5503-keyboard-repair-detached-backstops/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): Re-Attaching Keypad Segments</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-re-attaching-keypad-segments/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Mar 2023 09:10:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-re-attaching-keypad-segments/</guid><description>My Beogram 4002 (5513) restoration is moving along, and I&amp;rsquo;m currently focusing on aesthetics. The last step was to reattach two keypad sections that had become unglued. The image illustrates the problem:
I used a small amount of superglue gel and clamped the pads down with vise grips:
It&amp;rsquo;s important to use minimal glue to avoid damaging the delicate paint on the pad&amp;rsquo;s surface.

It&amp;rsquo;s subject to significant stress when opened and closed, while the presence of screw holes for the metal hinge makes it structurally vulnerable. I recently worked on a Beogram 4000 with a cracked hood and a broken-off piece.
Inspired by a previous restoration of a Beogram 3000 hinge, I aimed to create a similar solution for the 4000/4002 models...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-repair-of-a-cracked-plexiglass-hood-with-laser-cut-patches/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-repair-of-a-cracked-plexiglass-hood-with-laser-cut-patches/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): Cabinet Repair and Guiding Washers Installation</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-cabinet-repair-and-guiding-washers-installation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Oct 2022 04:52:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-cabinet-repair-and-guiding-washers-installation/</guid><description>While waiting for audio cables from Sounds Heavenly, I decided to fix up the wooden case of my Beogram 4002 (5513) turntable. Both corners were cracked, and the plastic washers that guide the sliding mechanism were gone. The first picture shows one of the damaged corners.

Repairing the cracks was simple. Since the case is held together with metal bands, I glued the wood pieces and clamped them until the glue dried...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-cabinet-repair-and-guiding-washers-installation/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-cabinet-repair-and-guiding-washers-installation/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Glueing a Delaminated Platter Back Together and Installation of New Cabined Guidance Washers</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-glueing-a-delaminated-platter-back-together-and-installation-of-new-cabined-guidance-washers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jul 2022 22:41:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-glueing-a-delaminated-platter-back-together-and-installation-of-new-cabined-guidance-washers/</guid><description>The Beogram 4000 I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on was unfortunately damaged during shipping due to inadequate packaging by the seller. Because the platter wasn&amp;rsquo;t secured, it moved around and ultimately split into two pieces. The images show the separated top and bottom sections of the platter.
Examining the platter&amp;rsquo;s interior reveals interesting details about its construction. The heavier bottom section of each platter was individually balanced, much like car tires. This involved drilling away small amounts of material from the heavier side, as evidenced by the red pen marks near the drill holes...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-glueing-a-delaminated-platter-back-together-and-installation-of-new-cabined-guidance-washers/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-glueing-a-delaminated-platter-back-together-and-installation-of-new-cabined-guidance-washers/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
