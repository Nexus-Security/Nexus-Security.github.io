There&amp;rsquo;s visual evidence that Santa, the Easter Bunny, Tooth Fairy, and Cupid are real and have visited your home. They&amp;rsquo;ve been caught on camera at your house! Don&amp;rsquo;t believe the naysayers, trust the evidence of your own eyes.
This photographic proof comes from CatchACharacter, a company that specializes in capturing images of fictional characters in action. They cater to kids who need visual confirmation to believe. While some of us were content with the stories and the treats that came with them, kids today require more tangible proof.</description></item></channel></rss>
