The Danish Prime Minister recently revealed that Denmark would hold a referendum in 2015 regarding its relationship with the EU. While widely reported as a vote on rejoining EU Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) law, the referendum actually focuses on replacing Denmark&amp;rsquo;s complete opt-out with a selective one. This post will examine the details of this issue, including which measures Denmark could potentially opt back into.
The origin of this opt-out can be traced back to the 1992 Danish referendum on the Maastricht Treaty...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-denmark-truly-choosing-to-rejoin-eu-justice-and-home-affairs-law/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-denmark-truly-choosing-to-rejoin-eu-justice-and-home-affairs-law/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The Day the Unicorns Cried: Understanding Phase 1 of the Brexit Negotiations</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-day-the-unicorns-cried-understanding-phase-1-of-the-brexit-negotiations/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Feb 2024 18:33:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-day-the-unicorns-cried-understanding-phase-1-of-the-brexit-negotiations/</guid><description>Professor Steve Peers, University of Essex
Introduction
The recent joint report on the progress of Brexit negotiations, along with a related paper from the Commission, represents an informal agreement to move to the next stage of negotiations. Based on this report, the EU27 have agreed that &amp;ldquo;sufficient progress&amp;rdquo; has been made to move forward. This next phase will focus on a transition period and, potentially starting in March 2018, the framework for the post-Brexit relationship between the UK and the EU...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-day-the-unicorns-cried-understanding-phase-1-of-the-brexit-negotiations/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-day-the-unicorns-cried-understanding-phase-1-of-the-brexit-negotiations/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Analysis of the UK government's proposals for cross-border civil litigation post-Brexit.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/analysis-of-the-uk-government-s-proposals-for-cross-border-civil-litigation-post-brexit/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Dec 2023 10:39:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/analysis-of-the-uk-government-s-proposals-for-cross-border-civil-litigation-post-brexit/</guid><description>Professor Steve Peers
Let&amp;rsquo;s say you&amp;rsquo;re a well-known UK politician who spends most of their time speaking on British radio or working in the US, only occasionally attending their primary job in France or Belgium. Imagine this politician is divorcing their German spouse. Which court and legal system would handle the divorce and child custody matters?
This scenario falls under the larger subject of international civil litigation, also known as private international law, which is the focus of the UK government&amp;rsquo;s most recent position paper on Brexit negotiations...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/analysis-of-the-uk-government-s-proposals-for-cross-border-civil-litigation-post-brexit/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/analysis-of-the-uk-government-s-proposals-for-cross-border-civil-litigation-post-brexit/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Details of the upcoming referendum on Denmark's participation in EU Justice and Home Affairs Law.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/details-of-the-upcoming-referendum-on-denmark-s-participation-in-eu-justice-and-home-affairs-law/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 May 2023 11:53:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/details-of-the-upcoming-referendum-on-denmark-s-participation-in-eu-justice-and-home-affairs-law/</guid><description>Steve Peers
Denmark&amp;rsquo;s involvement in international criminal law, exemplified by the TV show &amp;ldquo;The Bridge,&amp;rdquo; is facing uncertainty due to changing EU regulations. This situation will soon lead Denmark to vote on modifying its current near-total opt-out of EU Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) laws. While the general implications have been discussed, the specifics of this vote are now clearer.
To recap, Denmark negotiated opt-outs from the euro, defense, and parts of JHA law in 1992...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/details-of-the-upcoming-referendum-on-denmark-s-participation-in-eu-justice-and-home-affairs-law/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/details-of-the-upcoming-referendum-on-denmark-s-participation-in-eu-justice-and-home-affairs-law/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The European Commission introduces an anti-SLAPP initiative known as 'Daphne's Law'.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-european-commission-introduces-an-anti-slapp-initiative-known-as-daphne-s-law/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Apr 2023 02:25:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-european-commission-introduces-an-anti-slapp-initiative-known-as-daphne-s-law/</guid><description>Professor Justin Borg-Barthet, University of Aberdeen*
