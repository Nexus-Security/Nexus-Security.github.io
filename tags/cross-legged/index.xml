Its unique design is so flexible, it even allows for the sukhasana yoga pose while seated.
McClintock explained that the chair caters to millions of workers who experience fatigue, back pain, and stiff muscles from prolonged sitting. While crossing your legs can alleviate these issues, traditional office chairs lack the ergonomics. The CrossChair solves this by enabling various sitting positions, including cross-legged, promoting movement and reducing discomfort.</description></item></channel></rss>
