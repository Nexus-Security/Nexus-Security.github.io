The regulation of hate speech has recently resurfaced as a crucial legal and political topic in Europe. While the complexity of this issue and the varying views on balancing legislation with rights protection are well-known, the contrasting approaches of the EU and the Council of Europe, two closely linked entities, is notable. This difference raises questions about its underlying reasons and broader legislative ramifications in Europe.</description></item><item><title>Is Delfi restricting freedom of expression online in Estonia?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-delfi-restricting-freedom-of-expression-online-in-estonia/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jan 2024 21:35:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-delfi-restricting-freedom-of-expression-online-in-estonia/</guid><description>Lorna Woods, Professor of Media Law, University of Essex

A recent ruling by the European Court of Human Rights has reignited the debate about whether freedom of speech should have limitations, particularly when it comes to potentially offensive remarks targeting religious beliefs, such as those of the Muslim faith.

A recent case before the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) raises the question of whether internet site providers should be held accountable for comments made by users. This issue gained significance following the court&amp;rsquo;s ruling in MTE v. Hungary.

Instead, they could be granted some immunity regarding content posted by others.</description></item><item><title>The CJEU judgment in NH v Associazione Avvocatura per i diritti LGBTI — Rete Lenford has erased the blurry line between employment discrimination and the right to freedom of expression.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-judgment-in-nh-v-associazione-avvocatura-per-i-diritti-lgbti-rete-lenford-has-erased-the-blurry-line-between-employment-discrimination-and-the-right-to-freedom-of-expression/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Jul 2022 20:39:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-judgment-in-nh-v-associazione-avvocatura-per-i-diritti-lgbti-rete-lenford-has-erased-the-blurry-line-between-employment-discrimination-and-the-right-to-freedom-of-expression/</guid><description>Chiara De Capitani, Ph.D. Researcher in International Studies at the University of Naples &amp;ldquo;L&amp;rsquo;Orientale&amp;rdquo;
