Concerns about aluminum in our diets have been rising since the mid-1960s when it was linked to Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s disease. We encounter this metal from various sources, including cookware and clay dishes used for cooking or storing food, aluminum packaging, and even naturally occurring aluminum in foods like tea. Additionally, some foods contain aluminum-based additives, such as those found in baked goods.
Indeed, everyday foods like cake and tea can contribute to your daily aluminum intake.</description></item><item><title>Selecting the appropriate tea for the workplace break room</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/selecting-the-appropriate-tea-for-the-workplace-break-room/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jul 2022 16:24:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/selecting-the-appropriate-tea-for-the-workplace-break-room/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s common to find pre-mixed tea sachets or teabags in office pantries.
