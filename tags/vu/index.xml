It seems cassettes are making a comeback! I&amp;rsquo;m even hoping for new tapes and maybe even a revival of the Sony Walkman II.
This particular Beocord 9000 has a very dim display:

The &amp;ldquo;Time Cal&amp;rdquo; bulb is also weak, a common issue.

The initial step involved switching the original current limiting resistors with values suitable for modern SMD LEDs. These LEDs are more efficient and brighter, requiring significantly larger resistors to match the original brightness. Testing showed that 470 Ohm and 330 Ohm resistors for red and green LEDs, respectively, produced slightly brighter output compared to the original 180 Ohm and 120 Ohm resistors...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-restoration-of-the-peak-program-meter-with-smd-leds-iii-/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-restoration-of-the-peak-program-meter-with-smd-leds-iii-/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beocord 9000: Restoration of the Peak Program Meter Scale Illumination</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-restoration-of-the-peak-program-meter-scale-illumination/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Oct 2023 08:25:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-restoration-of-the-peak-program-meter-scale-illumination/</guid><description>Even though the scale illumination light bulb was functioning in the Beocord 9000 display, my customer opted for a replacement to avoid any potential issues during shipping. This makes sense because these bulbs are fragile and prone to breaking, especially with rough handling. I prefer to replace all bulbs to prevent future problems.
I performed this procedure before on a Beocord 9000 with a broken bulb, as documented on my blog...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-restoration-of-the-peak-program-meter-scale-illumination/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-restoration-of-the-peak-program-meter-scale-illumination/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beocord 9000: Restoring the Peak Program Meters with SMD LEDs</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-restoring-the-peak-program-meters-with-smd-leds/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Sep 2023 09:45:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-restoring-the-peak-program-meters-with-smd-leds/</guid><description>I recently refurbished a Beocord 9000&amp;rsquo;s Peak Program Meter (PPM), even though it was fully functional. This decision stemmed from my success in restoring a different Beocord&amp;rsquo;s PPM that had several broken segments.
Since the technology behind these PPMs is similar to that of a 7-segment display, I realized that the segments in this unit were also susceptible to future breakage. Therefore, I chose to preemptively address the issue while I had the opportunity...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-restoring-the-peak-program-meters-with-smd-leds/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-restoring-the-peak-program-meters-with-smd-leds/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beocord 9000: Restoration of the Peak Program Meter with SMD LEDs (II)</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-restoration-of-the-peak-program-meter-with-smd-leds-ii-/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Nov 2022 23:33:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-restoration-of-the-peak-program-meter-with-smd-leds-ii-/</guid><description>The Beocord 9000&amp;rsquo;s rebuilt Peak Program Meters (PPM) display passed a 24-hour test, confirming its functionality.
To reattach the red-green covers, I secured the display to ensure a tight seal, preventing light leakage. Using a soldering iron, I melted the plastic posts of the covers, replicating the original attachment method.
During cleaning, the glue holding the light guide dissolved, indicating it was likely polyvinyl ester-based. I used &amp;lsquo;Aleene&amp;rsquo;s Original Tacky Glue&amp;rsquo; as a substitute, providing a clear and durable bond...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-restoration-of-the-peak-program-meter-with-smd-leds-ii-/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-restoration-of-the-peak-program-meter-with-smd-leds-ii-/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beocord 9000: Peak Program Meter Scale Illumination with a Red/Green LED</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-peak-program-meter-scale-illumination-with-a-redgreen-led/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Aug 2022 03:51:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-peak-program-meter-scale-illumination-with-a-redgreen-led/</guid><description>During the restoration of a Beocord 9000 cassette deck, the light bulb illuminating the peak program meter&amp;rsquo;s dB scale malfunctioned. This common issue stems from the age of the bulbs, as their leads tend to oxidize and break under pressure.
The initial state of the display, lacking illumination for the numbers on the dB scale, is shown below:
The bulb is inserted into a waveguide that distributes light across the scale, with a textured surface behind the numbers for diffusion...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-peak-program-meter-scale-illumination-with-a-redgreen-led/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-peak-program-meter-scale-illumination-with-a-redgreen-led/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
