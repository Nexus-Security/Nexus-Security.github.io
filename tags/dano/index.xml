The CJEU&amp;rsquo;s recent ruling in Elisabeta Dano and Florin Dano v Jobcenter Leipzig revisits the sensitive issue of national laws that prevent economically inactive EU citizens from receiving special non-contributory benefits, even though those benefits are available to nationals in similar situations. Issued a year after the controversial Brey decision, this judgment aims to clarify the connection between Directive 2004/38, which concerns the free movement of EU citizens, and Regulation 883/2004, which deals with coordinating social security systems.</description></item><item><title>Following the Dano ruling, under what circumstances can unemployed EU citizens be deported?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/following-the-dano-ruling-under-what-circumstances-can-unemployed-eu-citizens-be-deported/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jul 2023 13:30:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/following-the-dano-ruling-under-what-circumstances-can-unemployed-eu-citizens-be-deported/</guid><description>Steve Peers
The recent Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decision in the Dano case focused on benefit applications, not deportation. Therefore, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t directly affect deportation. However, due to the Court&amp;rsquo;s interpretation of the EU citizens&amp;rsquo; Directive, it might indirectly impact deportation.
Earlier this year, I published a blog post about when unemployment could justify deporting or banning EU citizens. This post expands on that analysis, considering the Dano judgment.</description></item></channel></rss>
