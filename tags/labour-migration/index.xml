Introduction
The free movement of EU citizens and immigration and asylum from non-EU countries are central issues within EU law that have sparked considerable debate in recent years. This blog post examines the numerous legal developments in these areas over the past year. It first analyzes the disagreements surrounding the free movement rights of EU citizens and then explores the conflicting priorities in EU immigration and asylum law...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/review-of-eu-free-movement-immigration-and-asylum-law-in-2014/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/review-of-eu-free-movement-immigration-and-asylum-law-in-2014/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Will the new Blue Card proposal entice a greater number of highly skilled workers to the EU?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/will-the-new-blue-card-proposal-entice-a-greater-number-of-highly-skilled-workers-to-the-eu/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Oct 2023 16:35:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/will-the-new-blue-card-proposal-entice-a-greater-number-of-highly-skilled-workers-to-the-eu/</guid><description>Jean-Baptiste Farcy, Research Assistant, Universite Catholique de Louvain
Introduction
After a 2001 attempt to create a comprehensive EU law regarding entry and residency for non-EU workers failed, the EU&amp;rsquo;s approach to labor migration has been fragmented and industry-specific. Due to the sensitivity surrounding immigration and the importance of national sovereignty, the EU has focused on creating laws for a select few economic migrant categories.
Highly skilled workers are one such category...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/will-the-new-blue-card-proposal-entice-a-greater-number-of-highly-skilled-workers-to-the-eu/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/will-the-new-blue-card-proposal-entice-a-greater-number-of-highly-skilled-workers-to-the-eu/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Putting an end to the exploitation of seasonal workers: EU legislation targets the easiest issues.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/putting-an-end-to-the-exploitation-of-seasonal-workers-eu-legislation-targets-the-easiest-issues/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Aug 2023 15:08:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/putting-an-end-to-the-exploitation-of-seasonal-workers-eu-legislation-targets-the-easiest-issues/</guid><description>Steve Peers
The EU struggled to create legislation regarding migrant workers from outside the EU. Member States finally agreed on laws focused on higher-income migrants: the Blue Card Directive and the Directive on intra-corporate transferees. The EU also established general rules for admitting labor migrants with the single permit Directive.
In a new development, the EU introduced rules for lower-paid seasonal workers last year. This group is particularly susceptible to exploitation...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/putting-an-end-to-the-exploitation-of-seasonal-workers-eu-legislation-targets-the-easiest-issues/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/putting-an-end-to-the-exploitation-of-seasonal-workers-eu-legislation-targets-the-easiest-issues/</a></p></description></item><item><title>What are the reasons behind the ineffectiveness of the Blue Card Directive for highly-skilled workers, and what solutions can be implemented to improve its functionality?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-are-the-reasons-behind-the-ineffectiveness-of-the-blue-card-directive-for-highly-skilled-workers-and-what-solutions-can-be-implemented-to-improve-its-functionality/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 May 2023 18:38:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-are-the-reasons-behind-the-ineffectiveness-of-the-blue-card-directive-for-highly-skilled-workers-and-what-solutions-can-be-implemented-to-improve-its-functionality/</guid><description>Steve Peers
In 2009, the EU introduced the ‘Blue Card’ Directive to attract highly qualified individuals from non-EU countries. As part of a broader strategy for legal immigration, this Directive is crucial. However, a recent Commission assessment suggests that the Directive has not effectively reached its goals. This raises the question of necessary revisions for improvement.
Implementing the Directive
While all EU Member States obligated to implement the Directive have done so, the actual impact has been underwhelming...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-are-the-reasons-behind-the-ineffectiveness-of-the-blue-card-directive-for-highly-skilled-workers-and-what-solutions-can-be-implemented-to-improve-its-functionality/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-are-the-reasons-behind-the-ineffectiveness-of-the-blue-card-directive-for-highly-skilled-workers-and-what-solutions-can-be-implemented-to-improve-its-functionality/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Quit this job and shove it: the updated EU legislation on non-EU migrant workers</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/quit-this-job-and-shove-it-the-updated-eu-legislation-on-non-eu-migrant-workers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Mar 2023 14:40:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/quit-this-job-and-shove-it-the-updated-eu-legislation-on-non-eu-migrant-workers/</guid><description>Professor Steve Peers, Royal Holloway University of London

First, it explains the background and motivation behind introducing this Directive and its connection to other EU directives on economic migration. Second, it outlines the key changes this Directive brings. Finally, it highlights potential issues that will be analyzed in future posts...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/will-the-new-directive-on-intra-corporate-transferees-improve-the-safeguarding-of-third-country-nationals-and-bolster-eu-competitiveness/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/will-the-new-directive-on-intra-corporate-transferees-improve-the-safeguarding-of-third-country-nationals-and-bolster-eu-competitiveness/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
