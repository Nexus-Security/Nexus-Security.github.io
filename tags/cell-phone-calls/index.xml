It might sound impossible, but with a new service, you can make calls from the US and Canada to other countries at incredibly low rates.
We&amp;rsquo;re talking about rates like 2.36 cents per minute to China. Yes, you read that right. Still paying exorbitant rates? Get with the times and switch to the TEL3AdvantageMobile Plan before you make another call!</description></item><item><title>Phoneless in a Strange Land</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/phoneless-in-a-strange-land/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Sep 2023 04:43:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/phoneless-in-a-strange-land/</guid><description>We depend so heavily on our cell phones that we rarely consider what we&amp;rsquo;d do if they were unavailable or malfunctioning. What are your options in such situations?
Cell phone failures can occur for various reasons: damage, battery depletion, traveling to a location without service, or attempting international calls not covered by your plan. So, what&amp;rsquo;s the alternative?
Using hotel or public phones can result in unexpectedly high charges, especially for international calls.</description></item></channel></rss>
