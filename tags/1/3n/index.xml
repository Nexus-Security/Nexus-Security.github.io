This chip is responsible for storing calibration data and potentially the system time, although further investigation is required. A visual representation of the circuit is included below.
A positive aspect of the design is the inclusion of diode D27, which safeguards the battery against reverse polarity connection...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-replacing-the-ram-battery/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-replacing-the-ram-battery/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
