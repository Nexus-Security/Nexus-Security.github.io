Coinciding with International Holocaust Remembrance Day, the European Commission has released its initial assessment of how EU member states are putting into action the EU Framework Decision. This legislation addresses combating racism and xenophobia through criminal law.
Putting EU Law into Practice
EU member states were obligated to incorporate this law, a carryover from the pre-Lisbon Treaty era, by December 2010. The Council was then expected to evaluate the member states&amp;rsquo; progress based on the Commission&amp;rsquo;s report by November 2013...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-there-more-that-the-eu-and-its-member-states-can-do-to-combat-holocaust-denial-and-hate-crime/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-there-more-that-the-eu-and-its-member-states-can-do-to-combat-holocaust-denial-and-hate-crime/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The ECJ ruling in Joined Cases C-203/15 and C-698/15 Tele2 and Watson (Grand Chamber) on data retention and national law.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-ecj-ruling-in-joined-cases-c-203-15-and-c-698-15-tele2-and-watson-grand-chamber-on-data-retention-and-national-law/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Oct 2023 18:38:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-ecj-ruling-in-joined-cases-c-203-15-and-c-698-15-tele2-and-watson-grand-chamber-on-data-retention-and-national-law/</guid><description>Lorna Woods, Professor of Internet Law, University of Essex
Introduction
A recent court decision examined the legality of national data retention laws from a human rights standpoint. These laws remained in effect even after the Data Retention Directive was struck down in the Digital Rights Ireland case due to its disproportionate impact on Articles 7 and 8 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (EUCFR). This judgment clarifies the interpretation of Articles 7 and 8 within EU law, particularly in the context of the Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive, and may impact the UK&amp;rsquo;s relationship with the EU post-Brexit...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-ecj-ruling-in-joined-cases-c-203-15-and-c-698-15-tele2-and-watson-grand-chamber-on-data-retention-and-national-law/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-ecj-ruling-in-joined-cases-c-203-15-and-c-698-15-tele2-and-watson-grand-chamber-on-data-retention-and-national-law/</a></p></description></item><item><title>SilkAir will provide direct charter flights to Okinawa</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/silkair-will-provide-direct-charter-flights-to-okinawa/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Feb 2023 05:46:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/silkair-will-provide-direct-charter-flights-to-okinawa/</guid><description>To encourage travel between Singapore and Okinawa, SilkAir, the Okinawa Prefecture government, Japan, and Changi Airport Group are collaborating on seven direct SilkAir charter flights.

However, could EU law potentially protect Paddington, particularly by offering a new kind of protection for those forced to leave their home countries?
Background
EU law has detailed rules for two types of international protection: refugee status (based on the UN&amp;rsquo;s Geneva Convention) and subsidiary protection status for those who don&amp;rsquo;t qualify as refugees...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-possible-for-eu-law-to-rescue-paddington-bear-the-cjeu-is-creating-a-new-form-of-protection/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-possible-for-eu-law-to-rescue-paddington-bear-the-cjeu-is-creating-a-new-form-of-protection/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Tarakhel v Switzerland: Is this the end of the Dublin system?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/tarakhel-v-switzerland-is-this-the-end-of-the-dublin-system/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Oct 2022 05:19:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/tarakhel-v-switzerland-is-this-the-end-of-the-dublin-system/</guid><description>Dublin System Challenged Again: Tarakhel v Switzerland Introduction
Despite aiming for high human rights protection standards, the EU&amp;rsquo;s Dublin system, which assigns responsibility for each asylum-seeker to one Member State, has repeatedly encountered human rights issues. The recent European Court of Human Rights (&amp;lsquo;ECtHR&amp;rsquo;) judgments in Tarakhel v Switzerland and Sharifi v Italy and Greece further highlight the difficulties in aligning this system with ECHR obligations. Notably, the Tarakhel judgment goes beyond previous rulings by demonstrating that the Court of Justice of the European Union&amp;rsquo;s (CJEU) interpretation of the Dublin rules also conflicts with the ECHR...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/tarakhel-v-switzerland-is-this-the-end-of-the-dublin-system/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/tarakhel-v-switzerland-is-this-the-end-of-the-dublin-system/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
