To prevent damage, I had previously removed the rosewood trim.
The trim is attached to a metal frame that slides in and out to lock and unlock the cabinet. This frame relies on five guide washers, which are commonly broken in Beogram 4002 units. This one was no different. These washers have a unique design, as detailed in a past Beolover blog post.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002: Final Tasks, Adjustments &amp; Playing Records</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-final-tasks-adjustments-playing-records/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 00:35:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-final-tasks-adjustments-playing-records/</guid><description>The final steps of a Beogram 4002 Type 5513 restoration project involved addressing corrosion damage and replacing the 5-pin DIN phono plug. Using a helpful audio path diagram, continuity checks were performed from the cartridge connector to ensure proper signal flow.
The replacement phono plug, a REAN model with gold contact pins, was installed, though the tight fit of the rubber boot on the cable posed a minor challenge. As an improvement, a grounding switch was added to the output board, eliminating the need for an external grounding wire.</description></item></channel></rss>
