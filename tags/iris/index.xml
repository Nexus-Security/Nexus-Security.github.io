While &amp;ldquo;Google ET&amp;rdquo; might be a bit premature, efforts are underway to extend the internet&amp;rsquo;s reach into space.
The initial steps involve using internet technology within Earth&amp;rsquo;s orbit. Eventually, we might be assigning planet and galaxy codes to complement our current country codes. But first, let&amp;rsquo;s explore these initial steps.
Cisco is pioneering the use of routers in orbit through a defense department program called IRIS (Internet Routing In Space).</description></item><item><title>Mobile app-driven ATMs without screens could be the future of banking</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/mobile-app-driven-atms-without-screens-could-be-the-future-of-banking/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Oct 2022 01:09:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/mobile-app-driven-atms-without-screens-could-be-the-future-of-banking/</guid><description>EyeLock, a company that provides iris-based identity authentication solutions, has partnered with Diebold, a global provider of self-service technology, to create a screenless, compact ATM concept. A prototype called Irving is currently being tested by Citibank in the US.
This innovative ATM design eliminates the need for a PIN pad, card reader, or screen. Instead, users conduct transactions through a mobile app on their smartphone. The system utilizes near field communication (NFC), quick response (QR) code technology, and EyeLock&amp;rsquo;s iris scanning to verify the customer&amp;rsquo;s identity at the ATM.</description></item></channel></rss>
