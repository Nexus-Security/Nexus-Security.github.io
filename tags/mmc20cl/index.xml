The foam meant to support the tonearm had deteriorated, leaving it to swing freely.
Fortunately, the cartridge appeared undamaged, likely due to the tonearm&amp;rsquo;s light weight and protective tape. Testing on a restored Beogram 4000 confirmed its functionality.
The hood was in good condition, showing only minor scratches and signs of polishing.</description></item></channel></rss>
