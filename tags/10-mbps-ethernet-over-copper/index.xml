You might be able to obtain a 10 Mbps Ethernet connection for the same price.
It might seem implausible to get 10 Mbps for the price of 1.5 Mbps at the same location, given that business telecom pricing is based on bandwidth and distance. However, due to recent advancements in the telecommunications industry, many businesses can upgrade from their outdated T1 services to significantly faster options.</description></item></channel></rss>
