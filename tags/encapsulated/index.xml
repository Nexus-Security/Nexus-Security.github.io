Today, I worked on Output PCB #8 and fixed a loose key on the keypad.
The Output PCB #8 was initially in this condition:
I prefer to replace the output relay as they tend to get stuck with age. Luckily, the relay is the same one used for platter RPM switching, so my custom replacement boards work here as well:
These replacement parts are available to anyone interested; feel free to email me.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): Rebuilding the Output Board and Adding a Grounding Switch</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-rebuilding-the-output-board-and-adding-a-grounding-switch/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jun 2022 04:40:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-rebuilding-the-output-board-and-adding-a-grounding-switch/</guid><description>During the Beogram 4002 restoration, I took the opportunity to rebuild the output board while cleaning the keypad contacts. A common issue with these units is low or absent volume in one or both channels, often caused by the output relay. To address this, I replaced it with a modern, durable Japanese relay designed to last for many years. The original output board is shown here:
The old Siemens relay was swapped out for a custom-designed SMD relay assembly, pictured below:</description></item></channel></rss>
