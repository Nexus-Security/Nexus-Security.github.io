International trade agreements, particularly the proposed deals between the EU and the US (TTIP) and Canada (CETA), have garnered significant public interest. However, many legal professionals and students lack familiarity with this area of law and often apply domestic legal concepts to the international arena. For instance, there&amp;rsquo;s an assumption that national courts can enforce international trade rules and that companies can challenge state actions under these agreements in domestic courts.</description></item><item><title>The Achmea ruling by the CJEU: A Fatal Blow to Independent Investment Protection Tribunals</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-achmea-ruling-by-the-cjeu-a-fatal-blow-to-independent-investment-protection-tribunals/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2023 13:04:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-achmea-ruling-by-the-cjeu-a-fatal-blow-to-independent-investment-protection-tribunals/</guid><description>By Daniel Thym, Chair of Public, European and International Law, University of Konstanz*

Public interest in current events tends to be fleeting. Take, for example, the excitement generated in the international media by the regional parliament of Wallonia&amp;rsquo;s threat to block the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) with Canada. Currently, free trade is enjoying a surge in popularity thanks to Donald Trump’s opposition to it, as few Europeans are eager to be seen aligning with the US President on this issue.</description></item><item><title>Is the Luxembourg Court providing assistance in preliminary references and investment tribunals?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-luxembourg-court-providing-assistance-in-preliminary-references-and-investment-tribunals/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jul 2023 18:41:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-luxembourg-court-providing-assistance-in-preliminary-references-and-investment-tribunals/</guid><description>Hannes Lenk, PhD Candidate at the University of Gothenburg
The connection between arbitral tribunals and the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has been a source of legal debate for many years. While the present situation is straightforward and practical, it is not without controversy. Commercial arbitration tribunals are not seen as &amp;ldquo;courts or tribunals of a Member State&amp;rdquo; as defined by Article 267 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).</description></item><item><title>Opinion 2/15: Report on the Hearing on the Future of EU External Trade Policy</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/opinion-2-15-report-on-the-hearing-on-the-future-of-eu-external-trade-policy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jun 2023 01:32:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/opinion-2-15-report-on-the-hearing-on-the-future-of-eu-external-trade-policy/</guid><description>David Kleimann and Gesa Kübek*
The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) held hearings on September 13 and 14 to address Opinion 2/15, which focuses on the EU&amp;rsquo;s authority to finalize the EU-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (EUSFTA). This summary reviews the arguments presented by the Commission, the Council, and member states during the hearing. The initial section provides context and emphasizes the judgment&amp;rsquo;s systemic significance. Section II outlines the parties&amp;rsquo; primary arguments and highlights specific policy-related and novel legal points raised.</description></item><item><title>Commentary on the EU/Canada free trade agreement and its implications on the Irish constitution: Costello v The Government of Ireland and Ors [2022] IESC 44</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/commentary-on-the-eu-canada-free-trade-agreement-and-its-implications-on-the-irish-constitution-costello-v-the-government-of-ireland-and-ors-2022-iesc-44/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Mar 2023 02:23:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/commentary-on-the-eu-canada-free-trade-agreement-and-its-implications-on-the-irish-constitution-costello-v-the-government-of-ireland-and-ors-2022-iesc-44/</guid><description>Dr John Cotter, Lecturer in Law, Keele University, UK

Background
The EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), signed in 2016 after five years of talks, came at a critical point in EU trade policy. While trade wasn&amp;rsquo;t central to the Brexit vote earlier that year, prominent Brexit supporters used the EU&amp;rsquo;s slow trade deal progress to argue for a more agile UK that could ratify deals faster.</description></item><item><title>Is the EU/Canada free trade deal and investor protection disputes a blessing in disguise or a cause for concern?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-eu-canada-free-trade-deal-and-investor-protection-disputes-a-blessing-in-disguise-or-a-cause-for-concern/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Dec 2022 23:07:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-eu-canada-free-trade-deal-and-investor-protection-disputes-a-blessing-in-disguise-or-a-cause-for-concern/</guid><description>Steve Peers
Recent news suggests the EU/Canada free-trade agreement (CETA) faces obstacles due to the German government&amp;rsquo;s opposition to rules concerning investor/state dispute settlement. This situation carries potential implications for various aspects, including the EU/Canada and EU/USA trade deals, the EU&amp;rsquo;s broader trade and investment policies, and even the UK&amp;rsquo;s potential departure from the EU (&amp;ldquo;Brexit&amp;rdquo;).
Background
After commencing negotiations in 2009, the EU and Canada reached a preliminary agreement in 2013, pending finalization of technical points.</description></item></channel></rss>
