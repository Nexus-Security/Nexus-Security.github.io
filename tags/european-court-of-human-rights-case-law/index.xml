Since its rushed creation after the 9/11 attacks, the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) has become a cornerstone of EU criminal law. It replaces traditional extradition with a streamlined system lacking most of the usual limitations. This has worried critics concerned about potential miscarriages of justice but pleased supporters who appreciate the faster return of more fugitives to face justice.
Despite concerns from some EU countries&amp;rsquo; constitutional courts, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has long dismissed human rights criticisms of the EAW.</description></item><item><title>The Bosphorus presumption remains in effect in EU law and the ECHR, as demonstrated in the case of Avotiņš v.

On May 23, 2016, the court delivered its judgment in the case of Avotiņš v.

The regulation of hate speech has recently resurfaced as a crucial legal and political topic in Europe. While the complexity of this issue and the varying views on balancing legislation with rights protection are well-known, the contrasting approaches of the EU and the Council of Europe, two closely linked entities, is notable. This difference raises questions about its underlying reasons and broader legislative ramifications in Europe.</description></item><item><title>The CJEU is currently hearing important cases regarding the European Arrest Warrant, questioning whether mutual trust should be blind or general with exceptions.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-is-currently-hearing-important-cases-regarding-the-european-arrest-warrant-questioning-whether-mutual-trust-should-be-blind-or-general-with-exceptions/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Mar 2024 04:32:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-is-currently-hearing-important-cases-regarding-the-european-arrest-warrant-questioning-whether-mutual-trust-should-be-blind-or-general-with-exceptions/</guid><description>Henning Bang Fuglsang Madsen Sørensen, Associate Professor, Department of Law, University of Southern Denmark
The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) held a hearing on February 15th, 2016, concerning two cases, Aranyosi and Caldararu, both addressing whether surrender under a European Arrest Warrant (EAW) should be refused if there are concerns about potential inhumane prison conditions in the requesting state. These cases, originating from the same German court, delve into the balance between the principle of mutual recognition in EU criminal law and the protection of fundamental rights.</description></item><item><title>Workplace Privacy: The Strasbourg Grand Chamber Provides Clarity on Legal Standards</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/workplace-privacy-the-strasbourg-grand-chamber-provides-clarity-on-legal-standards/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Feb 2024 10:48:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/workplace-privacy-the-strasbourg-grand-chamber-provides-clarity-on-legal-standards/</guid><description>Lorna Woods, Professor of Internet Law, University of Essex
Background
The Bărbulescu case examined the permissible extent of employer monitoring of employee communications, including internet usage, particularly when private conversations might be mixed with work-related ones. An employee, dismissed for violating a company policy prohibiting personal use of work equipment, sued his employer in Romania. He lost and appealed under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which protects privacy rights, arguing that his employer&amp;rsquo;s monitoring of his communications violated the precedent set by Copland v UK.</description></item><item><title>Has workplace privacy become obsolete?

The question of when employers can access employee emails, texts, or internet usage is crucial for both parties involved. A recent judgment in the case of Barbulescu v Romania tackled this issue, but unfortunately, misleading headlines like &amp;ldquo;EU court allows employers to read all employee e-mails&amp;rdquo; have emerged. This is inaccurate for two reasons: the ruling originates from the European Court of Human Rights, not an EU court, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t grant employers unrestricted access to employee emails.</description></item><item><title>Challenging mass surveillance in the EU's Court of Justice: The Data Retention Directive</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/challenging-mass-surveillance-in-the-eu-s-court-of-justice-the-data-retention-directive/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Aug 2023 05:41:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/challenging-mass-surveillance-in-the-eu-s-court-of-justice-the-data-retention-directive/</guid><description>Steve Peers
This post discusses the EU&amp;rsquo;s data retention Directive and the Advocate-General&amp;rsquo;s opinion on its validity, particularly in light of the &amp;ldquo;Day We Fight Back&amp;rdquo; against mass surveillance.
Overall context
These cases, brought before the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) by Irish and Austrian courts, present a significant opportunity for the court to issue a landmark judgment on the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, unlike the 2011 Test-Achats judgment, which lacked a thorough examination of key issues.</description></item><item><title>Halet vs. Luxembourg: The Triumph of the Overlooked Champions</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/halet-vs-luxembourg-the-triumph-of-the-overlooked-champions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2023 13:27:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/halet-vs-luxembourg-the-triumph-of-the-overlooked-champions/</guid><description>Dimitrios Kafteranis* and Stelios Andreadakis**

The recent ruling by the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) Grand Chamber in the case of Halet v. Luxembourg signifies a win for whistleblower rights and freedom of expression. This decision concludes a decade-long legal struggle for Raphael Halet, overturning prior judgments by the Luxembourg Court of Appeal and the ECtHR&amp;rsquo;s Third Chamber.</description></item><item><title>Contrasting torture and other forms of ill-treatment: Cestaro v.

Edinburgh), Ph.D. candidate and academic assistant at the German Police University, argues that the &amp;ldquo;prohibited purpose&amp;rdquo; requirement, while crucial, is not the only factor differentiating torture from inhuman or degrading treatment. The European Court of Human Rights&amp;rsquo;s (ECtHR) judgment in Cestaro v. Italy illustrates this point.
The Judgment
Mr. Cestaro, a peaceful protester at the 2001 G-8 summit in Genoa, Italy, was subjected to severe beatings by Italian police while staying at a school being searched for radical protesters.</description></item><item><title>New ECHR ruling on freedom of expression and internet comment liability</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/new-echr-ruling-on-freedom-of-expression-and-internet-comment-liability/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Feb 2023 13:54:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/new-echr-ruling-on-freedom-of-expression-and-internet-comment-liability/</guid><description>Lorna Woods, Professor of Internet Law, University of Essex
A recent case before the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) raises the question of whether internet site providers should be held accountable for comments made by users. This issue gained significance following the court&amp;rsquo;s ruling in MTE v. Hungary.
Considering the importance of intermediaries in the internet&amp;rsquo;s growth, there are arguments for not treating them like traditional publishers. Instead, they could be granted some immunity regarding content posted by others.</description></item><item><title>The EU Charter of Rights post Conservative party amendments to UK human rights legislation</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-eu-charter-of-rights-post-conservative-party-amendments-to-uk-human-rights-legislation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Dec 2022 07:45:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-eu-charter-of-rights-post-conservative-party-amendments-to-uk-human-rights-legislation/</guid><description>Steve Peers
Many drivers have encountered the unfortunate experience of hitting a small animal that darted across the road at the wrong moment. Reactions vary from distress to indifference, but some feel a sense of triumph, having removed an obstacle from their path.
This last reaction mirrors the Conservative party&amp;rsquo;s stance on EU law within their UK human rights law reform proposals. They aim to diminish EU law&amp;rsquo;s influence, much like a driver indifferent to roadkill.</description></item><item><title>How committed are Member States to safeguarding fundamental rights through the EU's common rules on detention?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/how-committed-are-member-states-to-safeguarding-fundamental-rights-through-the-eu-s-common-rules-on-detention/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Dec 2022 14:34:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/how-committed-are-member-states-to-safeguarding-fundamental-rights-through-the-eu-s-common-rules-on-detention/</guid><description>By Debbie Sayers, Legal Research Consultant, http://interalia.org.uk
In early February 2014, the Commission released a concerning report regarding &amp;ldquo;common rules on detention.&amp;rdquo; The report revealed that a mere 18 out of 28 EU member states had implemented any of the intended instruments. This study was purely quantitative and did not assess the effectiveness of the rules or their impact on individuals.
The inadequate implementation of these fundamental commitments to enhance detainee rights is worrisome.</description></item><item><title>Is it possible for EU law to rescue Paddington Bear?

Privacy and data protection are distinct legal concepts originating from different legal frameworks and adjudicated by separate European courts. However, these concepts often intersect, and the relevant courts, namely the European Court of Justice (ECJ) interpreting EU data protection laws and the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) interpreting the right to privacy within the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), sometimes reference each other&amp;rsquo;s legal precedents and texts.</description></item><item><title>The ECtHR Grand Chamber makes a ruling on mass surveillance in the case of Big Brother Watch v UK.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-ecthr-grand-chamber-makes-a-ruling-on-mass-surveillance-in-the-case-of-big-brother-watch-v-uk/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Oct 2022 12:02:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-ecthr-grand-chamber-makes-a-ruling-on-mass-surveillance-in-the-case-of-big-brother-watch-v-uk/</guid><description>Professor Lorna Woods, an expert in internet law from the University of Essex, provides an in-depth analysis of a significant ruling by the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) concerning the United Kingdom&amp;rsquo;s surveillance regime, specifically its Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA).
