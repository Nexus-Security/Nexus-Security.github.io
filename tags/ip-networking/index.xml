XO Communications alone has a vast network of metro fiber, connecting thousands of buildings. And that&amp;rsquo;s just one provider, not even counting Ethernet over Copper options.
Metro Ethernet and its long-distance counterpart, Carrier Ethernet, are the future of telecommunications. The world is shifting from traditional circuit-based communication to packet-based IP networks. While your current internet might be a T1 line, your data likely transitions to an IP-based backbone at your provider&amp;rsquo;s location...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/1-000-000-miles-of-metro-ethernet-fiber-and-growing/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/1-000-000-miles-of-metro-ethernet-fiber-and-growing/</a></p></description></item><item><title>VoIP Phone Service Provides Flexibility</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/voip-phone-service-provides-flexibility/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jun 2024 02:13:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/voip-phone-service-provides-flexibility/</guid><description>Businesses of all sizes might be considering upgrading their phone systems but are unsure of the best approach. Should they stick with their existing Key Telephone or PBX system and upgrade it, or is it time to transition to VoIP? What many businesses may not realize is the wide range of options that VoIP solutions offer.
The key difference between VoIP and traditional phone systems lies in its network-based approach. While even a single-line phone or cell phone operates on a network, known as the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), this network has limitations...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/voip-phone-service-provides-flexibility/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/voip-phone-service-provides-flexibility/</a></p></description></item><item><title>From LAN to MAN to WAN</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/from-lan-to-man-to-wan/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Mar 2024 20:47:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/from-lan-to-man-to-wan/</guid><description>The world is currently experiencing a revolution in network technology. While computer networks have historically relied on various communication protocols, some adapted from the telephone industry, thereâ€™s a growing trend towards adopting IP as a universal networking standard. This shift towards IP encompasses all network types, from local area networks (LANs) to metropolitan area networks (MANs) and wide area networks (WANs).
This standardization trend originated in LANs. Today, most LANs utilize Ethernet network interfaces due to economies of scale rather than inherent superiority...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/from-lan-to-man-to-wan/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/from-lan-to-man-to-wan/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Ethernet Bandwidth is Downright Cheap</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-bandwidth-is-downright-cheap/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Oct 2023 18:07:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-bandwidth-is-downright-cheap/</guid><description>Business bandwidth solutions are significantly more expensive than residential options like DSL or Cable. While this is partly due to their guaranteed reliability and dedicated lines, another factor is the complex infrastructure involved. Providing business-grade services often requires collaboration between a long-haul carrier and the local phone company for the final connection.
Despite recent price drops in dedicated T1 connections, high-bandwidth services remain costly, potentially hindering smaller companies needing to transmit large amounts of data...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-bandwidth-is-downright-cheap/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-bandwidth-is-downright-cheap/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Trade In Your T1 Line For 10 Mbps Ethernet</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/trade-in-your-t1-line-for-10-mbps-ethernet/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Sep 2022 17:19:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/trade-in-your-t1-line-for-10-mbps-ethernet/</guid><description>If your T1 line contract is expiring soon or has already ended and you&amp;rsquo;re on a month-to-month plan, don&amp;rsquo;t rush to renew. You might be able to obtain a 10 Mbps Ethernet connection for the same price.
It might seem implausible to get 10 Mbps for the price of 1.5 Mbps at the same location, given that business telecom pricing is based on bandwidth and distance. However, due to recent advancements in the telecommunications industry, many businesses can upgrade from their outdated T1 services to significantly faster options...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/trade-in-your-t1-line-for-10-mbps-ethernet/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/trade-in-your-t1-line-for-10-mbps-ethernet/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
