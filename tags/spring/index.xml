These springs make removing and attaching the hood significantly easier. After consulting the service manuals, it&amp;rsquo;s clear that the Beogram 4000 was not designed with these springs.

The large aluminum plate wasn&amp;rsquo;t sitting correctly against the plinth when it was pushed back, making it impossible to align the platter flush with the plate.
The problem originated from one of the locking mechanisms in the back left corner. These locks, equipped with leaf springs, are designed to secure the plate to the frame when the plinth is moved back...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-repair-of-a-missing-leaf-spring-on-a-plate-lock/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-repair-of-a-missing-leaf-spring-on-a-plate-lock/</a></p></description></item><item><title>SPRING Singapore fully supports the enhancement of quality and standards</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/spring-singapore-fully-supports-the-enhancement-of-quality-and-standards/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Sep 2023 08:11:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/spring-singapore-fully-supports-the-enhancement-of-quality-and-standards/</guid><description>SPRING Singapore has increased its grant budget by S$10 million to assist local businesses in enhancing quality and utilizing standards as key business strategies.

It needed adjustments to align it properly. The service manual suggests adjusting the platter in relation to the chassis first, and then aligning the chassis within the enclosure. This ensures the platter sits flush and centered within the panel, achieving that desirable &amp;ldquo;Beoloving&amp;rdquo; aesthetic.
To illustrate the process, I created two videos...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-adjusting-the-platter-and-the-chassis/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-adjusting-the-platter-and-the-chassis/</a></p></description></item><item><title>La Yeon is now offering its Spring Menu</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/la-yeon-is-now-offering-its-spring-menu/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Nov 2022 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/la-yeon-is-now-offering-its-spring-menu/</guid><description>Source: The Shilla Seoul.
