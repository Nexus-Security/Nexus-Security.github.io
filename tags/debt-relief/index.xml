Decisions from the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on the European and Monetary Union (EMU) are infrequent. Recent cases on this topic, including landmark judgments like Pringle and Gauweiler, have addressed measures enacted during the Eurozone crisis. Among these decisions is Anagnostakis v Commission, a case challenging the Commission&amp;rsquo;s refusal to register a proposed European Citizens&amp;rsquo; Initiative (ECI) titled &amp;ldquo;One million signatures for solidarity...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-european-citizens-initiative-and-greek-debt-a-surprising-pairing/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-european-citizens-initiative-and-greek-debt-a-surprising-pairing/</a></p></description></item><item><title>What are the legal implications of leaving the economic and monetary union according to EU law?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-are-the-legal-implications-of-leaving-the-economic-and-monetary-union-according-to-eu-law/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Apr 2023 08:27:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-are-the-legal-implications-of-leaving-the-economic-and-monetary-union-according-to-eu-law/</guid><description>Steve Peers
Greece&amp;rsquo;s upcoming referendum on accepting its creditors&amp;rsquo; offer brings uncertainty. It&amp;rsquo;s unclear if rejecting the offer means Greece automatically leaves the EU or EMU, or defaults on its debt. Accepting the offer doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide clarity either, as negotiations were ongoing during the referendum announcement, potentially making the offer outdated.
Given the range of possibilities, examining the legal framework for departing economic and monetary union (EMU) is crucial. A key question is whether Greece must leave the EU if it exits the single currency...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-are-the-legal-implications-of-leaving-the-economic-and-monetary-union-according-to-eu-law/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-are-the-legal-implications-of-leaving-the-economic-and-monetary-union-according-to-eu-law/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The European citizens' initiative and the EU's authority regarding Greek debt restructuring.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-european-citizens-initiative-and-the-eu-s-authority-regarding-greek-debt-restructuring/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Nov 2022 12:31:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-european-citizens-initiative-and-the-eu-s-authority-regarding-greek-debt-restructuring/</guid><description>Professor Daniel Sarmiento, Professor of EU Law at the University Complutense of Madrid*
Determining the European Union&amp;rsquo;s legal authority is a sensitive and increasingly complex area of EU law. This complexity is compounded by the intricate body of case law on legal bases, making it difficult to navigate even after decades of precedents. Since the Lisbon Treaty&amp;rsquo;s enactment, EU competency has become a significant area of focus for EU constitutional lawyers, requiring meticulous attention...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-european-citizens-initiative-and-the-eu-s-authority-regarding-greek-debt-restructuring/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-european-citizens-initiative-and-the-eu-s-authority-regarding-greek-debt-restructuring/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
