Legend has it that a race among all the animals determined which twelve would be featured in the zodiac. The animals finished in the following order: rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, goat, monkey, rooster, dog, and pig. This sequence dictates the order of the animals in the zodiac.
The rat is generally agreed to be very clever.</description></item></channel></rss>
