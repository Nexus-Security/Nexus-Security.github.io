This component, crucial for record detection, was no longer available. While a previous solution involved using a modern phototransistor with circuit modifications, a simpler approach was considered.
Recognizing the functional similarity between photovoltaic cells and the original photocell, a test was conducted using readily available photodiodes. Initial results with a single photodiode proved insufficient, but connecting three in parallel yielded a promising voltage output...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-repair-of-a-broken-sensor-arm-photocell-with-three-smd-photodiodes/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-repair-of-a-broken-sensor-arm-photocell-with-three-smd-photodiodes/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
