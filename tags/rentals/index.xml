This online tool is available to everyone, not just BCR customers.
Arnold Kluck, CEO of BCR, explained that the company was founded to provide budget-friendly car rentals. He noted that customers frequently underestimate petrol costs at the end of their rental period, as itâ€™s easy to overlook this expense during travel planning.</description></item></channel></rss>
