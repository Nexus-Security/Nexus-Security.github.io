I made sure to use components from reputable Japanese brands like Nichicon and Rubycon, sourcing them through trusted distributors like Newark and Mouser. The process was straightforward, aside from uncovering a spider web (and its architect) beneath the main PCB. This restoration project also highlighted the existence of at least two different solenoid control circuits within the 5513 series.</description></item></channel></rss>
