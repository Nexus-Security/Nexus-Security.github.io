This was unusual, as previous 4002 and 4000 models hadn&amp;rsquo;t shown this problem. Although the light bulbs managing the circuit&amp;rsquo;s Automatic Gain Control (AGC) weren&amp;rsquo;t visually illuminated during motor operation, suggesting a longer lifespan compared to indicator bulbs, this unit proved otherwise. It&amp;rsquo;s likely that factors like mechanical vibrations, particularly during transport, could have damaged the bulbs...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-choppily-rotating-ac-platter-motor-repair-of-wien-bridge-oscillator-circuit/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-choppily-rotating-ac-platter-motor-repair-of-wien-bridge-oscillator-circuit/</a></p></description></item><item><title> Beomaster 8000: Microcomputer Board Reworked</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/-beomaster-8000-microcomputer-board-reworked/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jul 2022 09:08:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/-beomaster-8000-microcomputer-board-reworked/</guid><description>I worked on the Beomaster 8000 microcomputer board today. This Beomaster is an earlier model and uses a first-generation microcomputer board, unlike later models with directly replaceable, yet distinct, boards. I&amp;rsquo;ll show an example of a later model board at the end.
One issue with the first-generation boards is the metal enclosure surrounding the processor ICs. While necessary for shielding, it makes accessing components difficult. B&amp;amp;O used soldered metal tabs to connect the upper and lower sections, but these tabs are soldered to the board&amp;rsquo;s ground plane, requiring significant heat for removal...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/-beomaster-8000-microcomputer-board-reworked/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/-beomaster-8000-microcomputer-board-reworked/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
