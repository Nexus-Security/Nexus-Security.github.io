Digitizing, storing, and transferring medical records, along with automating administrative tasks, are readily achievable improvements. Additionally, innovations like remote diagnostics can extend healthcare access to underserved areas and emergency situations. However, the lack of widespread broadband infrastructure, particularly in rural areas, hinders progress.
The limited availability of high-speed internet connections poses a significant obstacle. Many healthcare facilities rely on outdated T1 lines, which are inadequate for transmitting large, high-resolution medical images and electronic medical records, impacting productivity.</description></item></channel></rss>
