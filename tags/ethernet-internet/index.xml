Now, direct Ethernet internet is possible.
Ethernet for internet access is popular in cities, mainly due to cost savings and simpler networking. Called Metro Ethernet or Carrier Ethernet, it extends your network using Ethernet across cities, countries, or to the internet.
Dedicated Internet Access (DIA) is the top choice for businesses, providing exclusive bandwidth unlike shared services like DSL, WiFi, and cable.</description></item></channel></rss>
