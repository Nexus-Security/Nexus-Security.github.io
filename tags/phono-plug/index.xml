The older plugs, often corroded, benefit from the upgrade. This particular Beogram 4000 was no exception.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a comparison of the old plug and the new, gleaming Neutrik plug (Newark 27B4483):
The old plug was removed, and the cable was prepped for the new plug. Stripping the outer insulation to this length works well:..<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-installation-of-a-neutrik-gold-plated-din5-plug/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-installation-of-a-neutrik-gold-plated-din5-plug/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002: Final Tasks, Adjustments &amp; Playing Records</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-final-tasks-adjustments-playing-records/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 00:35:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-final-tasks-adjustments-playing-records/</guid><description>The final steps of a Beogram 4002 Type 5513 restoration project involved addressing corrosion damage and replacing the 5-pin DIN phono plug. Using a helpful audio path diagram, continuity checks were performed from the cartridge connector to ensure proper signal flow.
The replacement phono plug, a REAN model with gold contact pins, was installed, though the tight fit of the rubber boot on the cable posed a minor challenge.
