The company stated that Asian consumers now represent nearly half of all luxury purchases worldwide. This shift implies that MICE organizers may need to elevate their events in this region to meet the expectations of attendees from the area.
â€œAsian travelers are very particular, and the hotel standards in this region are very high.</description></item></channel></rss>
