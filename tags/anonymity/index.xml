In June 2018, the Court of Justice announced its decision to alter its handling of personal data in preliminary ruling requests. Citing the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Court stated its commitment to safeguarding the data of individuals involved in these cases while upholding transparency and public access to court proceedings.
Starting July 2018, the names of individuals in all public documents related to preliminary rulings would be replaced with initials, not their actual ones, alongside a brief description of the case subject matter.</description></item></channel></rss>
