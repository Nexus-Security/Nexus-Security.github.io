The issue was a familiar one: the carriage wouldn&amp;rsquo;t move towards the platter, suggesting a faulty power transistor in the carriage motor&amp;rsquo;s H-bridge.
This recurring problem has become a pattern, leading to a routine replacement of the H-bridge transistors during restorations. However, this wasn&amp;rsquo;t standard practice in 2020, necessitating the turntable&amp;rsquo;s return for transistor replacement.
Along with the H-bridge transistors, other known problematic components were also updated.</description></item></channel></rss>
