However, Carrier Ethernet, a newer technology that extends Ethernet from the LAN to the WAN, is worth examining.
Extending an Ethernet connection from a building or campus to a distant location might seem strange considering traditional telecom&amp;rsquo;s long-standing dominance. However, the landscape is changing with new providers entering the market, unburdened by legacy telco standards...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-is-an-ethernet-connection/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-is-an-ethernet-connection/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Ethernet Domination</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-domination/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Sep 2023 16:22:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-domination/</guid><description>In the near future, Ethernet may become the sole networking standard.
Previously, local networking involved choices like Token Bus or Token Ring. Today, almost every Network Interface Card (NIC) uses Ethernet, with speeds ranging from 10 to 1,000 Mbps, and 10 Gbps becoming increasingly affordable. Local Area Networks (LANs) predominantly use switched Ethernet over twisted pair copper wiring with RJ-45 connectors, although fiber optics is becoming a competitor.
Cost drives this standardization...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-domination/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-domination/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
