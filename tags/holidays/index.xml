Did you know there&amp;rsquo;s a day specifically for acknowledging workaholics? It&amp;rsquo;s not an official holiday, of course, as that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t align with the workaholic spirit. Workaholics Day falls on July 5th, the day after most people are recovering from their Fourth of July festivities.
While others are recovering from fireworks or tending to minor burns, you might find yourself busy with crucial hardware upgrades in a server room.</description></item></channel></rss>
