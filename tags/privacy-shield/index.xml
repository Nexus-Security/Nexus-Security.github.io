The European Court of Justice (ECJ) recently issued its highly anticipated decision regarding the legitimacy of standard contractual clauses (SCCs) for transferring personal data outside the European Union. This decision is part of a larger effort to challenge the “surveillance capitalism” model employed by many online businesses. While this case significantly impacts SCCs and Facebook&amp;rsquo;s operations, it also reveals the ECJ&amp;rsquo;s stance against mass surveillance, a recurring theme in European jurisprudence.</description></item><item><title>Live.

While the USA is globally recognized, some of its customs remain perplexing. Take &amp;ldquo;Groundhog Day,&amp;rdquo; where the presence or absence of a groundhog&amp;rsquo;s shadow on February 2nd supposedly predicts six more weeks of winter. Beyond the USA, it&amp;rsquo;s more famous as a film where Bill Murray relives the same day, striving for perfection and Andie MacDowell&amp;rsquo;s affections. This concept has inspired others: Tom Cruise battling aliens and wooing Emily Blunt in Edge of Tomorrow, and Peter Capaldi&amp;rsquo;s efforts to breach a diamond wall and resurrect Jenna Coleman in Doctor Who&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Hell Bent.</description></item><item><title>Is the Commission's draft EU-US Privacy Shield adequacy decision a new shield for transatlantic privacy or just more of the same?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-commission-s-draft-eu-us-privacy-shield-adequacy-decision-a-new-shield-for-transatlantic-privacy-or-just-more-of-the-same/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jan 2023 16:39:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-commission-s-draft-eu-us-privacy-shield-adequacy-decision-a-new-shield-for-transatlantic-privacy-or-just-more-of-the-same/</guid><description>Dr. Maria Tzanou (Lecturer in Law, Keele University)
In October 2015, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruled in the Schrems case that the US Safe Harbor framework did not adequately protect personal data transfers from the EU. The court found that US mass electronic surveillance practices violated fundamental EU privacy rights.
To address this, the European Commission and the US agreed on a new framework called the EU-US Privacy Shield.</description></item></channel></rss>
