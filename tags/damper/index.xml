The carriage, which moves along a rod with bearings, had detached.
I took out the rod and bearings to put them back into the carriage correctly. Then, I used a wrench to secure them. This allowed me to reinstall the carriage.
Next, I started my usual restoration process, beginning with the arm lowering mechanism. I took apart the solenoid, damper, connecting parts, and springs.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5523): Restoration of the Arm Lowering and Tracking Systems</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5523-restoration-of-the-arm-lowering-and-tracking-systems/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 May 2024 01:04:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5523-restoration-of-the-arm-lowering-and-tracking-systems/</guid><description>My restoration of the Beogram 4002 (5523) began, as always, with the arm lowering mechanism. The lubricants in these mechanisms often harden with age, preventing the tonearm from lowering correctly. The mechanism is shown here in its original condition:
Each moving part was removed
for cleaning and re-lubrication before reassembly. Next, I lubricated the damper-to-arm linkage pivot point. This required removing the sensor arm, as pictured below from the back:</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): Restoration of the Arm Lowering Mechanism</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-restoration-of-the-arm-lowering-mechanism/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2024 11:46:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-restoration-of-the-arm-lowering-mechanism/</guid><description>My work began on the recently acquired Beogram 4002 (5513). The arm lowering mechanism, as is common, was the first issue to address. The usual hardened lubricant was present, resulting in sluggish movement. The setup can be seen here:
To address this, I removed the linkages and the damper to clean and lubricate them:
Here, the disassembled damper and linkages are visible:
A detailed video demonstration of this process is available.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: A Strange Solenoid and an Alien 7812 Impostor</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-a-strange-solenoid-and-an-alien-7812-impostor/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 00:24:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-a-strange-solenoid-and-an-alien-7812-impostor/</guid><description>As I was testing the restored tonearm carriage on my Beogram 8000 with some recently purchased Genesis reissues (Trespass, Foxtrot, Nursery Crime, etc.), I decided to turn my attention to the Beogram 4000 I had recently acquired from Italy. The most critical issue was its malfunctioning solenoid, which appeared unusual and unlike standard B&amp;amp;O components.
Upon disassembling the damper/solenoid assembly, I discovered a makeshift repair job. The original solenoid had been replaced with a different one, and a nail was used as a plunger to activate the solenoid linkage.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): Rebuilding the Arm Lowering and Tracking Mechanisms, and Installation of a New Carriage Pulley</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-rebuilding-the-arm-lowering-and-tracking-mechanisms-and-installation-of-a-new-carriage-pulley/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jan 2024 17:13:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-rebuilding-the-arm-lowering-and-tracking-mechanisms-and-installation-of-a-new-carriage-pulley/</guid><description>During the restoration of a Beogram 4002 (5513) turntable, the arm lowering and tracking mechanisms, often problematic due to hardened lubricants, required attention. While the lowering damper section was functional, the damper-to-arm linkage was stuck and only moved because its pin had loosened.
The restoration process involved carefully disassembling the arm lowering mechanism, cleaning it, and applying fresh lubrication. The seized damper-to-arm linkage was removed, requiring a workbench procedure to press out its stuck pin.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Restoration of the Arm Lowering and Tracking Systems</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-restoration-of-the-arm-lowering-and-tracking-systems/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jan 2024 04:47:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-restoration-of-the-arm-lowering-and-tracking-systems/</guid><description>My work began on the Beogram 4000 turntable that arrived from Germany. As is my practice, the tracking and arm lowering mechanisms were the first to be refurbished. The arm lowering mechanism, controlled by a solenoid and damper arrangement, is pictured here:
After removing components requiring cleaning and lubrication, the area looked like this:
Here are the disassembled parts:
With cleaning and lubrication complete, reassembly followed. Next, I addressed the seized damper-to-arm linkage, accessible only after detaching the sensor arm.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): Restoration of Arm Lowering and Tracking Systems</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-restoration-of-arm-lowering-and-tracking-systems/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Dec 2023 06:34:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-restoration-of-arm-lowering-and-tracking-systems/</guid><description>My first step when restoring a Beogram 4002 turntable is to focus on the arm lowering and tracking mechanisms. The arm lowering mechanism often requires attention because hardened lubricants can hinder the solenoid and damper assemblies. To address this, I disassemble the mechanism.
Once the solenoid and linkages are removed, I take the parts to my workbench for cleaning and re-lubrication.
Next, I address the linkage connecting the damper plunger to the tonearm, as it can cause delays in arm lowering, particularly after storage.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Lubricating and Adjusting the Solenoid to Tonearm Linkages</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-lubricating-and-adjusting-the-solenoid-to-tonearm-linkages/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Sep 2023 16:23:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-lubricating-and-adjusting-the-solenoid-to-tonearm-linkages/</guid><description>Following the solenoid replacement and removal of the faulty voltage regulator on my Beogram 4000 restoration project, the arm mechanism remained sluggish. This indicated a need to lubricate the connection between the damper and tonearm lift. Additionally, the tonearm&amp;rsquo;s horizontal alignment was significantly off. While attempting to adjust this with the set screw on the tonearm counterweight&amp;rsquo;s connecting arm, I discovered it was glued in place with epoxy, preventing screwdriver access - likely another consequence of a previous repair attempt.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): Restoration of Arm Lowering and Tracking System</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-restoration-of-arm-lowering-and-tracking-system/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Sep 2023 06:04:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-restoration-of-arm-lowering-and-tracking-system/</guid><description>My work began with the Beogram 4002&amp;rsquo;s arm lowering and tracking mechanisms, as is customary for me. My client had already addressed the cleaning and lubrication of the damper and solenoid linkages, so my task was to detach the linkage connecting the damper and tonearm. This required removing the sensor arm assembly, as shown here:
Extracting the sensor arm involved removing two screws at its base:
The linkage could then be detached:</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Increasing Tonearm Lowering Delay</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-increasing-tonearm-lowering-delay/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jun 2023 11:10:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-increasing-tonearm-lowering-delay/</guid><description>After installing a new hood on a Beogram 4000 turntable, the author noticed the tonearm descended too quickly. Adjusting the damper&amp;rsquo;s screw didn&amp;rsquo;t solve the problem, as the tonearm still dropped rapidly despite the damper slowing down.
Further inspection revealed the damper&amp;rsquo;s linkage was positioned very close to the damper plunger. This proximity meant the linkage moved immediately when the damper activated, even before the damper could build up enough vacuum to slow the tonearm&amp;rsquo;s descent effectively.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5523): Rebuilding the Arm Lowering Mechanism, and Tracking Sensor Bulb Replacement and Adjustment</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5523-rebuilding-the-arm-lowering-mechanism-and-tracking-sensor-bulb-replacement-and-adjustment/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 May 2023 11:02:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5523-rebuilding-the-arm-lowering-mechanism-and-tracking-sensor-bulb-replacement-and-adjustment/</guid><description>The initial step for restoring a Beogram 4002 turntable typically involves reconditioning the arm lowering mechanism and calibrating the tracking system. In this instance, hardened lubricants had affected the mechanical operation, and excessive sensitivity in the tracking sensor led to uncontrolled carriage movement after the arm lowered. The solenoid and damper assembly is depicted below:
The restoration began by disassembling the mechanism, cleaning all parts, and applying fresh lubrication:

To start, I took out the damper and linkages to clean and lubricate them. Thankfully, all the components were in good condition, so lubrication and reassembly were straightforward. Next, I lubricated the pivot point connecting the damper to the arm linkage. This required removing the sensor arm.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5503): Repair of a Dead H-Bridge and Some Other Updates</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5503-repair-of-a-dead-h-bridge-and-some-other-updates/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Apr 2023 12:52:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5503-repair-of-a-dead-h-bridge-and-some-other-updates/</guid><description>A Beogram 4002 turntable, previously restored in 2020, returned for repair. The issue was a familiar one: the carriage wouldn&amp;rsquo;t move towards the platter, suggesting a faulty power transistor in the carriage motor&amp;rsquo;s H-bridge.
This recurring problem has become a pattern, leading to a routine replacement of the H-bridge transistors during restorations. However, this wasn&amp;rsquo;t standard practice in 2020, necessitating the turntable&amp;rsquo;s return for transistor replacement.
Along with the H-bridge transistors, other known problematic components were also updated.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Rebuilding the Arm Lowering and Tracking Systems</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-rebuilding-the-arm-lowering-and-tracking-systems/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Mar 2023 14:24:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-rebuilding-the-arm-lowering-and-tracking-systems/</guid><description>Following the repair of the MMC cartridge mount on the Beogram 4000, attention shifted to the malfunctioning arm lowering and tracking mechanisms.
The arm lowering system, comprising a solenoid and damper, was examined. The damper and its associated linkages were removed for cleaning and lubrication.
Inspection revealed the absence of a vital rubber washer in the damper unit, substituted with a makeshift transparency foil piece. This modification hindered proper damper function.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Repair of a Cracked Solenoid Arm, Replacement of the Damper Gasket and Re-Glueing of a Plinth Corner</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-repair-of-a-cracked-solenoid-arm-replacement-of-the-damper-gasket-and-re-glueing-of-a-plinth-corner/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Dec 2022 14:06:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-repair-of-a-cracked-solenoid-arm-replacement-of-the-damper-gasket-and-re-glueing-of-a-plinth-corner/</guid><description>This Beogram 4000 required a few final adjustments before it could be returned to its owner following a wiring sleeve replacement on the carriage harness and a fix for an intermittent solenoid.
During its initial restoration in 2020, I was unfamiliar with some common problems that these turntables develop. One such issue involves the damper gasket, which tends to harden over time.

The sensor arm was then removed for disassembly to further work on the linkage.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): A Broken Off Solenoid Plunger and New Transport Lock Bushings</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-a-broken-off-solenoid-plunger-and-new-transport-lock-bushings/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Nov 2022 16:11:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-a-broken-off-solenoid-plunger-and-new-transport-lock-bushings/</guid><description>A Beogram 4002 turntable, recently serviced and returned to a customer, unexpectedly came back with a faulty tonearm. The culprit was a broken solenoid plunger, a part responsible for lowering the tonearm. This unusual breakage was likely due to material fatigue.
To fix the issue, the solenoid was replaced with one from a donor Beogram 4002. During the repair, it was discovered that the transport lock bushings had also deteriorated and needed replacement.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Restoration of Arm Lowering and Tracking Systems</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-restoration-of-arm-lowering-and-tracking-systems/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 May 2022 04:19:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-restoration-of-arm-lowering-and-tracking-systems/</guid><description>The initial phase of the Beogram 4000 restoration involved the arm&amp;rsquo;s lowering and tracking mechanisms.
