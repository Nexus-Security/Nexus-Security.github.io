These include flights from Manila to the UAE and routes connecting various Philippine cities to Taipei and Kaohsiung in Taiwan.
CEB received approval to operate seven more weekly flights between Manila and the UAE. This allows the airline to offer service to any destination within the UAE, expanding upon its current daily flights between Manila and Dubai.</description></item></channel></rss>
