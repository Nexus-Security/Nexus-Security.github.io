I began by replacing the electrolytic capacitors. As I&amp;rsquo;ve noted before, these Beocord 9000 units often require minimal recapping, if any. This particular unit seems to have been stored for a considerable period, and I already discovered one faulty capacitor, prompting me to replace the others.
My usual practice is to use audio-grade capacitors in the signal path and opt for high-reliability, 105Â°C rated, long-lasting capacitors elsewhere...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-replacing-capacitors/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-replacing-capacitors/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beocord 9000: Ready for Bench Testing</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-ready-for-bench-testing/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Feb 2023 17:45:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-ready-for-bench-testing/</guid><description>Over the weekend, I finished the seven-segment display repair. The LEDs performed without issue during a 24-hour burn-in test. I double-checked the LEDs after reassembling the display using my specialized test equipment. My test setup has two parts for evaluating the Beocord display. The left side tests all LEDs illuminated simultaneously, while the right side allows me to test each LED channel or individual LED by adjusting jumpers.
During individual LED testing, I observed some light bleed from the middle &amp;ldquo;dot&amp;rdquo; LEDs into the neighboring segments...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-ready-for-bench-testing/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-ready-for-bench-testing/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beocord 9000: Seven Segment Display Board Reworked</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-seven-segment-display-board-reworked/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2022 23:50:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-seven-segment-display-board-reworked/</guid><description>Setting up the Beosystem display board rework station took a bit longer than anticipated, but it&amp;rsquo;s finally ready for LED display repairs and testing. A working Beocord display helped confirm the test setup&amp;rsquo;s functionality.
The display board, with its front and back sides visible, now features markings indicating segment numbers and polarities.
Thirty-one LEDs comprise the display. The image provides a close-up view of the original LED lights.
Here, the original LED is juxtaposed with the replacement SMD LED...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-seven-segment-display-board-reworked/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-seven-segment-display-board-reworked/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beocord 9000: Displays and Lamps</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-displays-and-lamps/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Nov 2022 20:56:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-displays-and-lamps/</guid><description>This Beocord 9000 project was on hold until new Beolover displays arrived. In the meantime, basic functionality was confirmed - the Beocord can record and play cassettes. With the displays here, the next steps are to install them, conduct thorough cassette operation tests, and share the outcome.
The display work can be done without removing the Microcomputer and Display board.

While most capacitors were within specification, a few were not, including two that had completely failed. Notably, a 220uF capacitor (C56) on the Microcomputer/Display board was the culprit behind the Beocord&amp;rsquo;s inability to power on. Another failed 220uF capacitor (C7) of the same brand was discovered on the Dolby board. This highlights the importance of checking all electrolytic capacitors in such situations...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-replacing-capacitors-wrapped-up/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-replacing-capacitors-wrapped-up/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beocord 9000: Reassembly</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-reassembly/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jun 2022 06:42:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-reassembly/</guid><description>After recapping, cleaning, and maintenance, today was the day to begin reassembling the Beocord. Starting with an empty shell, the process began. While this Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen model has some unique disassembly quirks, the internal components are readily accessible.
The reassembly process mirrored the disassembly: the last boards removed were the first ones back in.
A complete reassembly wasn&amp;rsquo;t done at this stage as the displays still needed work. Removing the transformer simplified moving and positioning the Beocord due to the reduced weight...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-reassembly/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-reassembly/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
