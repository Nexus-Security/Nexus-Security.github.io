The EU&amp;rsquo;s visa policy has traditionally focused on managing illegal immigration and security threats while considering foreign policy goals. However, in recent years, promoting economic growth, particularly in the tourism sector, has become increasingly important. This shift, initiated by a 2012 Commission communication, is evident in recent updates to the EU&amp;rsquo;s visa &amp;lsquo;whitelist&amp;rsquo;. The criteria for visa liberalization now include trade and investment, leading to the inclusion of Peru and Colombia after they signed a trade agreement with the EU...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-eu-visa-policy-driving-growth/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-eu-visa-policy-driving-growth/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Farewell, harsh world: will there be visas for holidays post-Brexit?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/farewell-harsh-world-will-there-be-visas-for-holidays-post-brexit/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Sep 2022 00:06:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/farewell-harsh-world-will-there-be-visas-for-holidays-post-brexit/</guid><description>Steve Peers
Previously, I maintained that British citizens needing visas for short trips to the EU after Brexit was highly unlikely. I even disagreed with some &amp;ldquo;Remain&amp;rdquo; supporters who feared this outcome. The EU consistently lifts short-term visa requirements for wealthy nations (like the USA, Canada, and Japan) if they reciprocate for EU citizens. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t envision those on the &amp;ldquo;Leave&amp;rdquo; side supporting short-term visa requirements for EU citizens visiting the UK post-Brexit...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/farewell-harsh-world-will-there-be-visas-for-holidays-post-brexit/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/farewell-harsh-world-will-there-be-visas-for-holidays-post-brexit/</a></p></description></item><item><title>How can the EU address migrant fatalities in the Mediterranean?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/how-can-the-eu-address-migrant-fatalities-in-the-mediterranean/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Aug 2022 15:07:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/how-can-the-eu-address-migrant-fatalities-in-the-mediterranean/</guid><description>The recent tragedies in the Mediterranean Sea have added to the already significant number of migrant deaths. EU officials are responding to this urgent issue, and this is what their response should include.
First, a large-scale search and rescue operation is needed. The EU&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Triton&amp;rsquo; operation, which replaced the Italian &amp;lsquo;Mare Nostrum,&amp;rsquo; is insufficient for saving lives. It was incorrectly assumed that ending &amp;lsquo;Mare Nostrum&amp;rsquo; would deter migrants and reduce deaths...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/how-can-the-eu-address-migrant-fatalities-in-the-mediterranean/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/how-can-the-eu-address-migrant-fatalities-in-the-mediterranean/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Updating the visa policy of the European Union</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/updating-the-visa-policy-of-the-european-union/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jun 2022 13:19:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/updating-the-visa-policy-of-the-european-union/</guid><description>Professor Steve Peers
In 2014, the European Commission put forward a proposal to update the EU&amp;rsquo;s visa policy for short-term visits by revising the existing Visa Code. This proposal ultimately stalled due to disagreements between the European Parliament and the Council on whether or not to incorporate &amp;ldquo;safe passage&amp;rdquo; visas for individuals requiring protection. Currently, the Commission is revisiting this issue, this time prioritizing security concerns rather than economic benefits...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/updating-the-visa-policy-of-the-european-union/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/updating-the-visa-policy-of-the-european-union/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
