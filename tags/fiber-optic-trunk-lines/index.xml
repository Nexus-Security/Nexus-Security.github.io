While intercontinental cables have existed for years, low latency networks are becoming increasingly vital.
High-frequency trading, particularly the use of automated programs, drives the demand for low latency. These programs compete to execute trades milliseconds or even microseconds faster than competitors, a feat impossible for human traders. This speed makes the physical path between traders and exchanges critical, with the delay on this path known as latency...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/low-latency-connections-bridge-the-atlantic/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/low-latency-connections-bridge-the-atlantic/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
