Introduction It&amp;rsquo;s an honor to be presenting at Waseda University in Tokyo. Thank you to Professor Koji Tonami and Professor Kaoru Obata for making this lecture possible.

Although the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) affirmed the right of individuals to sue Member States for damages resulting from breaches of EU law over two decades ago in the Francovich case, most subsequent lawsuits have been initiated by businesses seeking compensation for financial losses. The CJEU has yet to address a case involving damages claims related to the free movement of EU citizens...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/an-important-irish-ruling-on-compensation-for-violation-of-eu-free-movement-law/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/an-important-irish-ruling-on-compensation-for-violation-of-eu-free-movement-law/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Finally free?

The recent Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decision in the Lanigan case, which deals with prolonged pre-trial detention and the European Arrest Warrant (EAW), is especially noteworthy given the UN&amp;rsquo;s recent statement regarding Julian Assange&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;arbitrary detention.&amp;rdquo; Assange, who is also facing an EAW, presents a unique situation. What can we learn from each of these cases about the intersection of detention length and the EAW?..<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/finally-free-detention-the-european-arrest-warrant-and-julian-assange/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/finally-free-detention-the-european-arrest-warrant-and-julian-assange/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Demonstrating the Efficacy of Health Interventions in Cases of Free Movement</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/demonstrating-the-efficacy-of-health-interventions-in-cases-of-free-movement/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jul 2023 08:18:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/demonstrating-the-efficacy-of-health-interventions-in-cases-of-free-movement/</guid><description>Angus MacCulloch, Lancaster University Law School
Two recent rulings concerning the free movement of goods (Articles 34/36 TFEU) highlight the critical importance of strong evidence when governments attempt to justify public health interventions in the market. The first example, a judgment from the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in Case C-148/15 Deutsche Parkinson Vereinigung, addressed the legality of fixed prices for prescription medicines in Germany. The second, a ruling from the Inner House of the Court of Session in Scotland in Scotch Whisky Assoc v LA [2016] CSIH 77, upheld the Scottish Government&amp;rsquo;s plan to introduce minimum unit pricing (MUP) for alcohol, finding it compatible with Article 34...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/demonstrating-the-efficacy-of-health-interventions-in-cases-of-free-movement/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/demonstrating-the-efficacy-of-health-interventions-in-cases-of-free-movement/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The case of Scotch Whisky Association v Lord Advocate [2017] UKSC 76 demonstrates the appropriateness and necessity of implementing minimum alcohol pricing.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-case-of-scotch-whisky-association-v-lord-advocate-2017-uksc-76-demonstrates-the-appropriateness-and-necessity-of-implementing-minimum-alcohol-pricing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jun 2023 20:36:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-case-of-scotch-whisky-association-v-lord-advocate-2017-uksc-76-demonstrates-the-appropriateness-and-necessity-of-implementing-minimum-alcohol-pricing/</guid><description>Angus MacCulloch, Law School, Lancaster University (@AngusMacCulloch)
The UK Supreme Court, in a long-awaited decision on SWA v Lord Advocate, dismissed the Scotch Whisky Association&amp;rsquo;s (SWA) appeal, allowing the Scottish Government to proceed with its Minimum Unit Pricing (MUP) policy on alcohol sales. This policy, setting a minimum price of £0.50 per unit of alcohol under the 2012 Alcohol (Minimum Pricing)(Scotland) Act, faced a five-year delay due to legal challenges arguing its conflict with EU law...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-case-of-scotch-whisky-association-v-lord-advocate-2017-uksc-76-demonstrates-the-appropriateness-and-necessity-of-implementing-minimum-alcohol-pricing/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-case-of-scotch-whisky-association-v-lord-advocate-2017-uksc-76-demonstrates-the-appropriateness-and-necessity-of-implementing-minimum-alcohol-pricing/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Regardless of the CJEU's decision, data retention could potentially continue to exist under national law.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/regardless-of-the-cjeu-s-decision-data-retention-could-potentially-continue-to-exist-under-national-law/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jan 2023 07:49:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/regardless-of-the-cjeu-s-decision-data-retention-could-potentially-continue-to-exist-under-national-law/</guid><description>Matthew White, Ph.D candidate, Sheffield Hallam University
A central question regarding internet privacy is whether governments should be allowed to store data about everyone&amp;rsquo;s online and phone activities in the name of fighting terrorism and serious crime. This issue, known as &amp;ldquo;data retention,&amp;rdquo; raises crucial questions about balancing privacy and security, both nationally and within the European Union. Initially, the EU&amp;rsquo;s electronic privacy (e-Privacy) Directive offered member states the choice to implement data retention rules, deviating from the usual rule of communication confidentiality outlined in the directive...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/regardless-of-the-cjeu-s-decision-data-retention-could-potentially-continue-to-exist-under-national-law/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/regardless-of-the-cjeu-s-decision-data-retention-could-potentially-continue-to-exist-under-national-law/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Data Retention is still a permanent fixture, at least for the time being.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/data-retention-is-still-a-permanent-fixture-at-least-for-the-time-being/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jan 2023 04:11:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/data-retention-is-still-a-permanent-fixture-at-least-for-the-time-being/</guid><description>Matthew White, Ph.D candidate, Sheffield Hallam University.
Introduction
On January 30, 2018, the human rights organization Liberty announced on Twitter that the Court of Appeal found the UK government to be acting illegally. The government was gathering internet and phone records from the entire country and allowing public bodies to access them without any suspicion of serious crime or independent approval.
This referred to the Court of Appeal&amp;rsquo;s (CoA) decision in the case of Tom Watson and Others v Secretary of State for the Home Department concerning access to communication data under the Data Retention and Investigatory Power Act 2014 (DRIPA 2014)...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/data-retention-is-still-a-permanent-fixture-at-least-for-the-time-being/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/data-retention-is-still-a-permanent-fixture-at-least-for-the-time-being/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
