Fiber optic bandwidth has become the top choice for business private lines and internet connections. It offers a practically unlimited capacity with minimal latency, packet loss, and jitter. Prices are now more competitive than before, provided you don&amp;rsquo;t encounter high construction costs.
Why Fiber Can Involve Construction Expenses
Businesses accustomed to T1 lines, Ethernet over Copper, or business cable might be surprised by quotes that include substantial construction costs for installing a fiber line.</description></item><item><title>Can Satellite Be The Answer to Your Business Broadband Needs?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/can-satellite-be-the-answer-to-your-business-broadband-needs/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Dec 2023 13:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/can-satellite-be-the-answer-to-your-business-broadband-needs/</guid><description>By: John Shepler

How do these symmetries work?
Symmetrical bandwidth offers identical upload and download speeds, often labeled as 3 x 3 Mbps Ethernet or 100 x 100 Mbps Fast Ethernet. A classic example is the T1 line, with a fixed 1.5 Mbps for both uploading and downloading.
T1, DS3, and SONET exemplify symmetrical bandwidth services, a legacy of their development by telephone companies for bulk voice calls, requiring equal bandwidth in both directions.</description></item><item><title>Get Your Business Bandwidth Free</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/get-your-business-bandwidth-free/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Mar 2023 04:31:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/get-your-business-bandwidth-free/</guid><description>Telecommunication expenses are a considerable cost for businesses, but there are ways to reduce them significantly. Beyond switching providers, you can eliminate your bandwidth costs entirely through a real estate model.
Imagine renting an apartment where the rent from other units covers your mortgage, allowing you to live there for free. This principle applies to internet connections as well.
You can become your own service provider by ordering a service and router, then leasing out the bandwidth to neighboring businesses.</description></item><item><title>Tired of Flaky Internet Connections?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/tired-of-flaky-internet-connections/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Oct 2022 09:03:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/tired-of-flaky-internet-connections/</guid><description>Running a business is challenging when your tools are unreliable. You would think technology would make things easier, but it often has the opposite effect. As processes become more complex and interconnected, they seem to become less dependable. A simple cash transaction can turn into an e-commerce nightmare. Why can&amp;rsquo;t things just work flawlessly all the time?
While expecting perfection might be unrealistic, your business systems should function seamlessly most of the time.</description></item><item><title>WANs That Act Like LANs</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/wans-that-act-like-lans/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2022 21:43:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/wans-that-act-like-lans/</guid><description>Local Area Networks (LANs) are so commonplace in businesses that they often go unnoticed, much like the electrical outlets we use daily. They provide a standardized way to connect devices, making them function seamlessly without users needing to consider technical details.
Networks vs Utilities LANs can be compared to electricity: reliable and readily available. Just as we don&amp;rsquo;t think about voltage variations, we expect LANs to work without needing to understand the intricacies of Ethernet standards.</description></item></channel></rss>
