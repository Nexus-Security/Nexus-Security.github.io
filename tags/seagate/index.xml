Backblaze engineer Brian Beach revealed that Seagate&amp;rsquo;s 1.5TB drives had an annual failure rate of about 14%, significantly higher than Hitachi&amp;rsquo;s 2TB drives at approximately 1% and Western Digital&amp;rsquo;s 1TB drives at 3%. For 3TB drives, Seagate again had the highest failure rate at around 9%, while Western Digital stood at about 3% and Hitachi at roughly 1%.</description></item></channel></rss>
