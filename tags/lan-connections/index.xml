These technologies can be used together to increase bandwidth while reducing costs.
Traditionally, there&amp;rsquo;s a significant difference in speed and compatibility between customer networks and telecom networks. These differences stem from their distinct developmental paths. While connecting these networks is now possible through clever interfacing, it&amp;rsquo;s not ideal. We can now transmit data packets between LANs over telephone-based telecom networks, but a better solution exists.</description></item></channel></rss>
