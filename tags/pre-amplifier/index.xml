The owner of a recently restored 4002 (5504) requested the RIAA installation, making his Beogram the first AC-motor 4002 to feature a Beolover RIAA.
The new board features an input jack that connects to a replicated Beogram-style plug through a multi-lead wiring harness.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Installation of Newly Designed Beolover RIAA Pre-Amplifier Board</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-installation-of-newly-designed-beolover-riaa-pre-amplifier-board/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Aug 2022 23:13:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-installation-of-newly-designed-beolover-riaa-pre-amplifier-board/</guid><description>Due to demand, I designed an internal RIAA pre-amplifier board for the Beogram 4000, adapting the circuit from my recent redesign for the DC motor Beogram 4002 and 4004. I installed this new board in a Beogram 4000 that was in for a warranty repair. This post details the installation process; for technical data, refer to my previous post about the 4002/4 version&amp;rsquo;s performance, as the circuits are identical.
The current prototype board has some features that will be absent in the final version.</description></item></channel></rss>
