Some argue that the UK might be forced into accepting an EU army, further integration of the single currency, or other undesirable developments. However, the crucial point is whether the UK possesses the power to govern such advancements, either through veto or opting out.
This analysis will address the key concerns related to continued EU membership, demonstrating how the UK maintains control through opt-outs or veto power in each scenario...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/briefing-1-on-the-eu-referendum-will-the-uk-have-influence-over-the-eu-s-future-as-a-member/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/briefing-1-on-the-eu-referendum-will-the-uk-have-influence-over-the-eu-s-future-as-a-member/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Is the choice between the EU and the Commonwealth a true dilemma for the UK, or is it a misleading decision?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-choice-between-the-eu-and-the-commonwealth-a-true-dilemma-for-the-uk-or-is-it-a-misleading-decision/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Nov 2022 01:39:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-choice-between-the-eu-and-the-commonwealth-a-true-dilemma-for-the-uk-or-is-it-a-misleading-decision/</guid><description>Steve Peers
The UK is part of many international organizations: the EU, NATO, the UN Security Council, and the Commonwealth are just a few examples. Out of these, the Commonwealth, which recently held its latest summit, has the strongest ties to British history and culture because it primarily consists of former British colonies. (There are some Commonwealth members that were never colonies, and certain former colonies like the US opted not to join...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-choice-between-the-eu-and-the-commonwealth-a-true-dilemma-for-the-uk-or-is-it-a-misleading-decision/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-choice-between-the-eu-and-the-commonwealth-a-true-dilemma-for-the-uk-or-is-it-a-misleading-decision/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Farewell, harsh world: will there be visas for holidays post-Brexit?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/farewell-harsh-world-will-there-be-visas-for-holidays-post-brexit/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Sep 2022 00:06:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/farewell-harsh-world-will-there-be-visas-for-holidays-post-brexit/</guid><description>Steve Peers
Previously, I maintained that British citizens needing visas for short trips to the EU after Brexit was highly unlikely. I even disagreed with some &amp;ldquo;Remain&amp;rdquo; supporters who feared this outcome. The EU consistently lifts short-term visa requirements for wealthy nations (like the USA, Canada, and Japan) if they reciprocate for EU citizens. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t envision those on the &amp;ldquo;Leave&amp;rdquo; side supporting short-term visa requirements for EU citizens visiting the UK post-Brexit...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/farewell-harsh-world-will-there-be-visas-for-holidays-post-brexit/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/farewell-harsh-world-will-there-be-visas-for-holidays-post-brexit/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
