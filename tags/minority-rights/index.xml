Introduction
On February 3rd, the General Court (GC) overturned a European Commission decision for the first time, determining that the Commission failed to provide sufficient justification when it denied registration to a proposed European Citizens&amp;rsquo; Initiative (ECI). This concise judgment in the Minority SafePack case concerns procedural matters within the relatively new ECI, which was established in 2012. The judgment offers valuable insight to those interested in the ECI and, more broadly, in opportunities for citizens to participate in EU lawmaking.</description></item><item><title>EU law and its impact on minority languages in court proceedings: exploring the potential and constraints.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/eu-law-and-its-impact-on-minority-languages-in-court-proceedings-exploring-the-potential-and-constraints/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Sep 2022 23:18:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/eu-law-and-its-impact-on-minority-languages-in-court-proceedings-exploring-the-potential-and-constraints/</guid><description>Steve Peers
The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), through its judgment in the Ruffer case, reinforced and broadened its stance on using minority languages in legal processes.
The case involved Mrs. Ruffer, a German citizen residing in Germany, who was injured in a skiing incident in Bolzano, Italy, a region where German is commonly spoken. She held Ms. Pokoma, a Czech citizen living in the Czech Republic, responsible for the accident and filed a lawsuit against her in the Italian courts.</description></item></channel></rss>
