When the UK voted to leave the EU on June 23, 2016, Northern Ireland voted to remain. This result has led Sinn FÃ©in to call for a referendum on Irish unification, which would allow Northern Ireland to stay in the EU. This discussion has gained momentum following the most recent Northern Ireland Assembly election, which saw a significant decrease in the Unionist vote.</description></item><item><title>Negotiating the T-TIP: Why Putting the Cart Before the Horse is a Doomed Constitutional Strategy</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/negotiating-the-t-tip-why-putting-the-cart-before-the-horse-is-a-doomed-constitutional-strategy/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Apr 2023 19:03:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/negotiating-the-t-tip-why-putting-the-cart-before-the-horse-is-a-doomed-constitutional-strategy/</guid><description>Emanuela Matei*

Introduction
In June 2015, the European Commission urged the termination of bilateral investment treaties (BITs) within the EU. These agreements were established between Austria, Romania, Slovakia, Netherlands, and Sweden. The Commission&amp;rsquo;s rationale was that EU membership necessitates Member States to resolve internal matters under EU law, superseding any other legal frameworks.</description></item><item><title>Is it possible to renegotiate the UK's membership of the EU?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-possible-to-renegotiate-the-uk-s-membership-of-the-eu/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jul 2022 03:14:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-possible-to-renegotiate-the-uk-s-membership-of-the-eu/</guid><description>Steve Peers
Can the UK renegotiate its EU membership terms? This question is easier to answer after analyzing David Cameron&amp;rsquo;s stated objectives for such a renegotiation.
The Telegraph summarized these objectives into seven key points, which we will examine individually.
Firstly, limiting the movement of people from countries joining the EU in the future. This wouldn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily require a Treaty amendment, as accession treaties require unanimous agreement. However, if the goal is to allow for potentially indefinite delays in free movement, a Treaty amendment might be needed, as this represents a permanent exception to a fundamental Treaty rule.</description></item></channel></rss>
