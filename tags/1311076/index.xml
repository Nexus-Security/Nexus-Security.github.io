The restoration process involves removing the motor bearings, cleaning them, and applying fresh oil. To ensure effectiveness, a vacuum is used to draw the oil into the porous bearing material. The bearings are then cleaned of excess oil and reinstalled.
After reassembly, each motor undergoes a 24-hour RPM stability test using a specialized device.</description></item></channel></rss>
