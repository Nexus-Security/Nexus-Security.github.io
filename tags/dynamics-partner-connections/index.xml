There&amp;rsquo;s a noticeable lack of opportunities for partners, especially consultants, to connect and collaborate in a non-competitive setting. Sharing ideas, best practices, and brainstorming together are invaluable activities.
Speaking of which, mark your calendars for the GP Partner Connections conference this fall in Orlando! This valuable knowledge-sharing event takes place from Saturday, October 23rd through Monday, October 25th at the Renaissance Resort near SeaWorld.</description></item></channel></rss>
