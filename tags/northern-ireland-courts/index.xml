In a landmark decision, a UK court has disapplied portions of a UK Act of Parliament for the first time since Brexit due to conflicts with the Withdrawal Agreement, specifically highlighting the ongoing connection between UK and EU legal systems. This unexpected development, though previously argued for, underscores the UK government&amp;rsquo;s consistent underestimation of Article 2&amp;rsquo;s impact on rights-related cases...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-dillon-judgment-exemption-of-laws-and-article-2-of-the-northern-ireland-protocol-windsor-framework/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-dillon-judgment-exemption-of-laws-and-article-2-of-the-northern-ireland-protocol-windsor-framework/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Allister Round 2: Exploring the depths of UK constitutional law in the Mariana Trench</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/allister-round-2-exploring-the-depths-of-uk-constitutional-law-in-the-mariana-trench/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Feb 2023 09:41:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/allister-round-2-exploring-the-depths-of-uk-constitutional-law-in-the-mariana-trench/</guid><description>Anurag Deb, PhD student, Queenâ€™s University Belfast School of Law

Introduction
It&amp;rsquo;s a common observation in UK constitutional law that complex issues rarely have simple solutions. Instead, they often result in multiple, overlapping interpretations. This is certainly the case with the recent Allister and others v Prime Minister and others [2022] NICA 15 ruling from the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal (NICA). It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that this case is headed to the UK Supreme Court on appeal, ensuring further analysis and discussion...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/allister-round-2-exploring-the-depths-of-uk-constitutional-law-in-the-mariana-trench/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/allister-round-2-exploring-the-depths-of-uk-constitutional-law-in-the-mariana-trench/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Is the legality of the Northern Ireland Protocol in question?

Brexit has negatively impacted Northern Ireland, as was anticipated. Five years after the Brexit referendum, the High Court in Belfast issued a significant political decision regarding a legal challenge to the Northern Ireland Protocol. This challenge mirrors the Miller 1 case concerning Brexit&amp;rsquo;s constitutionality. Northern Ireland&amp;rsquo;s fragile political landscape, exacerbated by Brexit, has exposed existing systemic issues.
The legal challenge was brought forward by two main parties: Clifford Peeples, who opposed the Irish Sea border, and unionist members, including former First Minister Arlene Foster, who argued that the Protocol weakens Northern Ireland&amp;rsquo;s ties with Great Britain...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-legality-of-the-northern-ireland-protocol-in-question-examination-of-the-high-court-ruling/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-legality-of-the-northern-ireland-protocol-in-question-examination-of-the-high-court-ruling/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
