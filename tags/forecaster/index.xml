This happened to me recently with a client attempting to use their Dynamics GP user ID for Forecaster 7. As expected, it was unsuccessful due to GP&amp;rsquo;s encryption method when generating user IDs in SQL. This encryption prevents the same ID from functioning in Forecaster, even with proper database permissions...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/users-of-forecaster-and-dynamics-gp/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/users-of-forecaster-and-dynamics-gp/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Predictor Line Arrangements Over Time</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/predictor-line-arrangements-over-time/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jun 2024 07:03:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/predictor-line-arrangements-over-time/</guid><description>In the past, using special characters in Forecaster 6.7 often led to problems, so avoiding even periods was recommended. While things have improved in Forecaster 7.0, it&amp;rsquo;s still best to avoid special characters in name and ID fields. Recently, a period caused confusion in Forecaster again.
Here&amp;rsquo;s what happened:
A line set was named with a period at the end (e.g., &amp;ldquo;HR.&amp;rdquo;). This line set was used as an override on an input set...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/predictor-line-arrangements-over-time/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/predictor-line-arrangements-over-time/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Permissions for the Forecaster Database Transfer Tool</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/permissions-for-the-forecaster-database-transfer-tool/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jan 2024 23:49:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/permissions-for-the-forecaster-database-transfer-tool/</guid><description>Special thanks to Jake Friedl from Microsoft for his guidance on this issue. When using Forecaster with Management Reporter, you&amp;rsquo;ve likely encountered the need to transfer budget data from Forecaster to Microsoft Dynamics GP using the Forecaster Database Transfer Tool. This allows you to include budget information in your Management Reporter reports.
While this tool is generally efficient and user-friendly, needing to run it regularly for up-to-date numbers can be a drawback...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/permissions-for-the-forecaster-database-transfer-tool/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/permissions-for-the-forecaster-database-transfer-tool/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Breaking Down the New Budgets in Forecaster</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/breaking-down-the-new-budgets-in-forecaster/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Nov 2023 13:53:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/breaking-down-the-new-budgets-in-forecaster/</guid><description>I have to admit, certain questions make me uncomfortable. Some of these questions include:
Why is it necessary to rebuild the reports.dic file so frequently? Are commissions classified as payables or payroll expenses? What is the process for setting up a new budget year in Forecaster? Question #3 comes up often, and it makes me uncomfortable because there isn&amp;rsquo;t a straightforward answer. Often (and I&amp;rsquo;ve been guilty of this too), the term &amp;ldquo;input set&amp;rdquo; is mistaken to be synonymous with &amp;ldquo;budget...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/breaking-down-the-new-budgets-in-forecaster/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/breaking-down-the-new-budgets-in-forecaster/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Useful Microsoft Forecaster Scripts</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/useful-microsoft-forecaster-scripts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Apr 2023 10:36:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/useful-microsoft-forecaster-scripts/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been away from the blog for a while, but I hope Steve has kept you all engaged (and maybe even made you think hard about some technical topics).

Let me quickly share a cool feature in Forecaster called &amp;ldquo;input by all segments.&amp;rdquo; Imagine your Forecaster system uses segments like DEPT (3 characters) and MAIN (4 characters). DEPT is assignable, while MAIN is reversible.
Typically, users go to Data&amp;raquo;Input, choose an Input Set, and specify a DEPT. This brings up a multi-row input screen with MAIN accounts as rows and periods as columns...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/options-for-inputting-forecasts-in-the-nifty-nifty-forecaster/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/options-for-inputting-forecasts-in-the-nifty-nifty-forecaster/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Sections and Accounts for Forecasting</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/sections-and-accounts-for-forecasting/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Feb 2023 20:22:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/sections-and-accounts-for-forecasting/</guid><description>Forecaster uses Lines (or Line Sets) to define which accounts appear in input sets or reports. You can assign these lines to specific cost centers, creating an &amp;ldquo;override&amp;rdquo; that tailors the accounts displayed for a particular department&amp;rsquo;s input set. For example, the Accounting department would only see accounts relevant to their work.

While Forecaster generally operates on a straightforward currency conversion principle, utilizing an &amp;ldquo;originating&amp;rdquo; currency for input and mapping it to a &amp;ldquo;functional&amp;rdquo; currency for output, these tasks offer nuanced control.
Even when auto-translate is active, situations may arise where manual intervention is needed. The key difference lies in the scope of translation. TRANSLATE comprehensively converts all departments or assignable segments from the &amp;ldquo;originating&amp;rdquo; to the &amp;ldquo;functional&amp;rdquo; currency...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/forecaster-translate-versus-translatel/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/forecaster-translate-versus-translatel/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Forecaster.ini...or possibly outie?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/forecaster-ini-or-possibly-outie/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Jul 2022 23:30:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/forecaster-ini-or-possibly-outie/</guid><description>Even though I have a baby at home who loves a good belly laugh, I wanted to share a helpful tip about Forecaster 7.0.

The Forecaster database, created after installation using the Forecaster Database Creation Wizard, stores all the relevant data. During creation, a database owner is assigned, who can then manage periods within the Forecaster application itself.
Users can interact with Forecaster through either the web interface or the client application. While both offer data access, input, and reporting functionalities, the client application provides additional features for administrators...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/who-is-it-what-is-it-forecaster/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/who-is-it-what-is-it-forecaster/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
