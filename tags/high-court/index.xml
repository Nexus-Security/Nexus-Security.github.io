This piece revisits the recent High Court ruling on the UK government&amp;rsquo;s authority to initiate the process of leaving the EU. It delves deeper into the judgment&amp;rsquo;s EU law implications, going beyond the political turmoil it has caused and potentially extending beyond the immediate consequences of Brexit. The article argues that the judgment, though focused on UK constitutional law, also touches upon the issue of safeguarding transnational rights, such as those of British citizens in other EU countries, during a Member State&amp;rsquo;s withdrawal.</description></item></channel></rss>
