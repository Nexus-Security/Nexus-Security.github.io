This shift is driven by the growing need for bandwidth as technology progresses. Over the past few decades, various sectors, including internet service providers, cable companies, healthcare facilities, and large enterprises, have progressively adopted fiber optic connections. Services like Metro Ethernet have made this transition feasible even for mid-sized businesses. Now, small businesses and individual consumers are poised to benefit from this technology.</description></item><item><title>What Real Estate Developers Need to Know About Ethernet</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-real-estate-developers-need-to-know-about-ethernet/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Aug 2023 23:03:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-real-estate-developers-need-to-know-about-ethernet/</guid><description>High-speed internet is becoming as essential as other utilities like electricity, water, and phone services. Businesses rely on it, and those working from home expect it. Developers of office spaces, industrial parks, and new housing divisions should incorporate broadband internet into their plans, rather than making it the responsibility of buyers or renters. Broadband access is not just a desirable feature, but a potential revenue source, and Ethernet is the best technology for the job.</description></item><item><title>VoIP is For Smaller Companies Too</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/voip-is-for-smaller-companies-too/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Aug 2023 10:22:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/voip-is-for-smaller-companies-too/</guid><description>Many people think Enterprise VoIP solutions are too complex and costly for small businesses. While that&amp;rsquo;s often accurate, advanced IP PBX systems can sometimes boost productivity for smaller, sophisticated companies. However, for those seeking quality calls at reasonable prices, SMB (Small and Medium Business) VoIP solutions can be the perfect solution.
VoIP ranges from using your computer as a phone to systems that are virtually identical to standard network-switched technologies. Home-based businesses might prefer VoIP services that utilize their existing Cable or DSL broadband for internet access.</description></item><item><title>WiMAX 2 Will Challenge Fiber For Speed</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/wimax-2-will-challenge-fiber-for-speed/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jul 2023 16:29:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/wimax-2-will-challenge-fiber-for-speed/</guid><description>The idea that copper and wireless technologies are outdated in terms of bandwidth is circulating. While copper has found new life as a last-mile solution for Metro Ethernet services, and wireless stands out for its unmatched mobility, a new wireless technology is emerging that might surpass even fiber optic speeds.
It&amp;rsquo;s surprising to think that wireless could outpace fiber in terms of bandwidth.
While not all fiber optic services offer top speeds of 10 GigE, with many customers receiving 50 to 100 Mbps, especially in the case of Fiber To The Home (FTTH), the prospect of achieving 100 to 300 Mbps wirelessly anywhere in a city is enticing.</description></item><item><title>SIP Trunking and Internet On a T1</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/sip-trunking-and-internet-on-a-t1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jun 2023 20:41:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/sip-trunking-and-internet-on-a-t1/</guid><description>Many smaller companies utilize T1 lines for dedicated internet access, opting for this solution after experiencing unreliable or unavailable consumer-grade broadband options. T1 lines offer these businesses dependable, robust bandwidth at increasingly affordable prices. However, many are unaware that they can bundle their broadband and telephone services onto a single T1 line.
Traditional T1 lines offer various service options. The original format, designed for the telephone industry, provides 24 channels of digitized telephone service over two pairs of twisted copper phone wires.</description></item><item><title>PRI over Cable Cost Savings</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/pri-over-cable-cost-savings/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Apr 2023 01:32:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/pri-over-cable-cost-savings/</guid><description>Many businesses use ISDN PRI, a technology that bundles multiple phone lines onto a single digital cable, for cost-effective phone service. While initially implemented with T1 lines, offering 23 usable voice channels after reserving one for signaling, ISDN PRI can now be delivered over cable networks.
Modern phone systems, including PBX and key systems, typically support ISDN PRI, allowing businesses to scale their phone lines up to 46, 69, 92, or more.</description></item><item><title>4G Wireless Expands Across The Nation</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/4g-wireless-expands-across-the-nation/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Mar 2023 20:43:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/4g-wireless-expands-across-the-nation/</guid><description>If your home or business needs affordable broadband internet, there&amp;rsquo;s good news: a solution might be closer than you think.

While ordering these services separately remains an option, businesses now have more choices.
Bundled services, offering both phone and internet, often make the most sense for smaller businesses with limited needs and budgets. Two primary bundled options provide cost savings compared to separate services.
The first option, known as Integrated T1 or SIP Trunking, utilizes line sharing but differs in connection methods.</description></item><item><title>Triple Play Helps Wireline Fight Satellite</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/triple-play-helps-wireline-fight-satellite/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Aug 2022 21:27:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/triple-play-helps-wireline-fight-satellite/</guid><description>The market for television services is completely saturated. While getting TV used to be simple, viewers now have a wide range of options, including over-the-air, cable, satellite, telco (AT&amp;amp;T), and fiber optic (Verizon).
The recent discontinuation of analog television transmissions was met with indifference by most, except for a small number of consumers who didn&amp;rsquo;t buy a converter or new digital TV. Now, these individuals are rushing to find converter boxes or signing up with cable or satellite providers like DirecTV or Dish Network.</description></item></channel></rss>
