This shift is driven by the growing need for bandwidth as technology progresses. Over the past few decades, various sectors, including internet service providers, cable companies, healthcare facilities, and large enterprises, have progressively adopted fiber optic connections. Services like Metro Ethernet have made this transition feasible even for mid-sized businesses. Now, small businesses and individual consumers are poised to benefit from this technology.</description></item><item><title>The Next Decade of Bandwidth - Part IV</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-next-decade-of-bandwidth-part-iv/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Mar 2024 15:35:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-next-decade-of-bandwidth-part-iv/</guid><description>The most desirable wireless frequencies will soon be completely allocated. These prime frequencies, ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand MHz, offer high bandwidth, strong building penetration, and accommodate small antennas. The problem is that the number of these channels is finite. Similar to real estate, once the best spots are taken, expansion continues into less ideal areas.
Finding more bandwidth means moving up or down the electromagnetic spectrum, which presents challenges.</description></item><item><title>I'm Sorry, Dave. I Can't Let You Use That Channel</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/im-sorry-dave-i-cant-let-you-use-that-channel/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 01:17:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/im-sorry-dave-i-cant-let-you-use-that-channel/</guid><description>Despite the recent surge in spectrum auctions, leading to the perception that all available frequencies are allocated, opportunities for innovation remain. While unoccupied spectrum bands are scarce, similar to unclaimed land, existing communication channels often have unused capacity.
The challenge in maximizing spectrum utilization stems from the operational nature of transmitters and receivers. Simultaneous transmissions on the same channel create interference, rendering communication unintelligible. This interference is noticeable with walkie-talkies, overlapping radio stations, and even WiFi networks and wireless phones sharing the 2.</description></item><item><title>The Next Decade of Bandwidth - Part I</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-next-decade-of-bandwidth-part-i/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Nov 2023 15:02:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-next-decade-of-bandwidth-part-i/</guid><description>The recent collapse of the AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile merger, while seemingly a win for consumers against a potential monopoly, wasn&amp;rsquo;t truly about market control. Even if the merger succeeded, Verizon and Sprint would still offer competition. The real issue was bandwidth.
The evidence is clear: immediately after the deal failed, AT&amp;amp;T purchased $1.9 billion in spectrum from Qualcomm with FCC approval, while Verizon, after acquiring $3.6 billion worth of spectrum from Comcast and Time Warner Cable, also bought $315 million of spectrum from Cox.</description></item><item><title>FCC Confiscates Remaining TV Channels For Twitter</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/fcc-confiscates-remaining-tv-channels-for-twitter/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Apr 2023 17:29:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/fcc-confiscates-remaining-tv-channels-for-twitter/</guid><description>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), overwhelmed by the rapidly growing demand for wireless broadband, has seized control of all remaining broadcast television channels. This unexpected move aims to dedicate this valuable spectrum solely to Twitter.
FCC Chairman Lowon B. Andwidth explained that a recent study revealed Twitter&amp;rsquo;s explosive growth will soon consume all available bandwidth. He expressed concern not only for the impact on internet browsing, video streaming, texting, and email, but also for the potential chaos if Twitter users experience posting delays.</description></item></channel></rss>
