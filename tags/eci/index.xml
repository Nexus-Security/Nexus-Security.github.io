Introduction
Decisions from the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on the European and Monetary Union (EMU) are infrequent. Recent cases on this topic, including landmark judgments like Pringle and Gauweiler, have addressed measures enacted during the Eurozone crisis. Among these decisions is Anagnostakis v Commission, a case challenging the Commission&amp;rsquo;s refusal to register a proposed European Citizens&amp;rsquo; Initiative (ECI) titled &amp;ldquo;One million signatures for solidarity.</description></item><item><title>The General Court has made a ruling on the European Citizens' Initiative, stating that the Commission must provide reasons for refusing to register proposals.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-general-court-has-made-a-ruling-on-the-european-citizens-initiative-stating-that-the-commission-must-provide-reasons-for-refusing-to-register-proposals/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jan 2023 16:31:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-general-court-has-made-a-ruling-on-the-european-citizens-initiative-stating-that-the-commission-must-provide-reasons-for-refusing-to-register-proposals/</guid><description>Anastasia Karatzia, Assistant Professor in EU law, Erasmus School of Law
Introduction
On February 3rd, the General Court (GC) overturned a European Commission decision for the first time, determining that the Commission failed to provide sufficient justification when it denied registration to a proposed European Citizens&amp;rsquo; Initiative (ECI). This concise judgment in the Minority SafePack case concerns procedural matters within the relatively new ECI, which was established in 2012. The judgment offers valuable insight to those interested in the ECI and, more broadly, in opportunities for citizens to participate in EU lawmaking.</description></item></channel></rss>
