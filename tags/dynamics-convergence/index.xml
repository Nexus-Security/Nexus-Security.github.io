Tuesday started with a discussion about making custom reports. It was inspiring to hear how partners and customers use tools like SQL Reporting Services and Excel Report Builder.

My time in the Hands on Labs was spent exploring new content, including demos using Demomate technology.</description></item></channel></rss>
