Initial examination showed it needed some work.
A bench test confirmed the bearings were squeaking, a common issue. The motor was disassembled to remove the bearings for lubrication.
The bearings were placed in motor oil under a vacuum. This process forces air out of the bearing material and allows oil to penetrate it. After a few days, the bearings were removed from the oil.</description></item></channel></rss>
