The Brexit vote is often seen as an attack on both academic expertise and EU citizens in the UK, whether accurate or not. These two issues intersect in a recent dispute involving the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and the London School of Economics (LSE). The FCO allegedly barred EU citizens from advising the government on Brexit, though the details are unclear.
The LSE reportedly informed staff that the FCO no longer sought Brexit advice from EU nationals, sparking a controversy that made its way to social media and prominent news outlets like The Guardian...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-brexit-causing-the-british-mind-to-close-the-impact-on-eu-academics-and-government-guidance/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-brexit-causing-the-british-mind-to-close-the-impact-on-eu-academics-and-government-guidance/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Clarification on Dual Citizens and EU Citizenship by the ECJ</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/clarification-on-dual-citizens-and-eu-citizenship-by-the-ecj/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jun 2024 16:08:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/clarification-on-dual-citizens-and-eu-citizenship-by-the-ecj/</guid><description>Professor Steve Peers
A fundamental principle within EU law concerning the freedom of movement posits that it primarily pertains to EU citizens residing in a Member State different from their home country. Consequently, EU citizens residing in their own Member State cannot generally invoke this law. However, ECJ case law sometimes permits them to assert rights based on their EU citizenship.
This begs the question: what happens to citizens of two Member States?..<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/clarification-on-dual-citizens-and-eu-citizenship-by-the-ecj/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/clarification-on-dual-citizens-and-eu-citizenship-by-the-ecj/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The resolution of disputes and the role of the ECJ in the proposed withdrawal agreement</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-resolution-of-disputes-and-the-role-of-the-ecj-in-the-proposed-withdrawal-agreement/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jun 2024 19:53:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-resolution-of-disputes-and-the-role-of-the-ecj-in-the-proposed-withdrawal-agreement/</guid><description>Professor Steve Peers, University of Essex*
A key point of contention in post-Brexit EU/UK relations is the degree to which the UK remains bound to the EU Court of Justice (ECJ). This issue arises first in the withdrawal agreement being negotiated, a draft of which was recently proposed by the EU Commission.

Election laws typically set the stage but don&amp;rsquo;t directly determine the winner, although there are notable exceptions like the 2000 US election.
The 2014 Commission President election is unique because the rules changed, and their interpretation is debated. Previously, the European Council appointed the President after European Parliament approval. The Treaty of Lisbon introduced new rules, applied for the first time, stating the Parliament &amp;ldquo;elects&amp;rdquo; the President based on the Council&amp;rsquo;s nomination, &amp;ldquo;taking account&amp;rdquo; of Parliament election results...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-appropriate-for-the-outcome-of-the-european-parliament-elections-to-dictate-the-selection-of-the-next-president-of-the-european-commission-or-are-there-valid-concerns-about-this-democratic-process/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-appropriate-for-the-outcome-of-the-european-parliament-elections-to-dictate-the-selection-of-the-next-president-of-the-european-commission-or-are-there-valid-concerns-about-this-democratic-process/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Is the free movement of people in the European Economic Area (EEA) distinct from that in the EU?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-free-movement-of-people-in-the-european-economic-area-eea-distinct-from-that-in-the-eu/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jun 2024 10:34:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-free-movement-of-people-in-the-european-economic-area-eea-distinct-from-that-in-the-eu/</guid><description>Karin Fløistad: PhD Candidate, European University Institute; practicing lawyer at Norwegian law firm Simonsen Vogt Wiig
The UK&amp;rsquo;s post-Brexit relationship with the EU often involves discussions about the free movement of people, with the EEA Agreement frequently cited as a potential model. This piece will analyze two key distinctions between the EEA Agreement&amp;rsquo;s approach to the free movement of people and that of full EU membership.

In a recent speech outlining the UK&amp;rsquo;s post-Brexit plans, Prime Minister Theresa May&amp;rsquo;s approach resembled Machiavelli&amp;rsquo;s strategies more than Leonardo da Vinci&amp;rsquo;s artistry. Nonetheless, her speech provided a glimpse into the legal structure the UK government envisions for its relationship with the EU during a transitional period after Brexit.

Germany&amp;rsquo;s recent exploration of expelling unemployed EU citizens has sparked interest among critics of EU free movement in the UK. As this topic gains traction, it&amp;rsquo;s timely to clarify the circumstances under which EU citizens can be expelled.
While the EU Citizens&amp;rsquo; Directive empowers Member States to expel citizens for reasons related to public policy, security, or health, it explicitly prohibits using these grounds for economic reasons. Consequently, the rules for expelling unemployed EU citizens lie elsewhere within the Directive...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-possible-to-deport-and-prohibit-unemployed-eu-citizens-from-returning/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-possible-to-deport-and-prohibit-unemployed-eu-citizens-from-returning/</a></p></description></item><item><title>No Longer Negotiable: The Rights of EU and UK Citizens Post-Brexit</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/no-longer-negotiable-the-rights-of-eu-and-uk-citizens-post-brexit/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2024 04:58:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/no-longer-negotiable-the-rights-of-eu-and-uk-citizens-post-brexit/</guid><description>Steve Peers
Introduction
This post examines the findings of a British Future inquiry into the post-Brexit status of EU citizens in the UK. It outlines the inquiry&amp;rsquo;s key recommendations concerning EU citizens residing in the UK after Brexit, proposes recommendations for UK citizens in the EU after Brexit, and analyzes the concept of &amp;lsquo;associate citizenship&amp;rsquo; for UK citizens post-Brexit. The latter two points, while outside the inquiry&amp;rsquo;s scope, are addressed in parallel...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/no-longer-negotiable-the-rights-of-eu-and-uk-citizens-post-brexit/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/no-longer-negotiable-the-rights-of-eu-and-uk-citizens-post-brexit/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Does Rottmann Rule apply in the UK?

The UK Supreme Court recently examined the meaning and implications of the CJEU&amp;rsquo;s Rottmann judgment, which deals with EU law limitations on the revocation of national citizenship. The British Home Secretary&amp;rsquo;s legal representative contended that interpreting the judgment beyond cross-border situations would exceed the CJEU&amp;rsquo;s authority.

Experts in EU law see Treaty amendments as a monumental event. After the Treaty of Lisbon, significant changes to the Treaty seemed improbable in the near future.

Introduction
A crucial Brexit issue with potentially significant consequences for many is the fate of UK citizens in the EU and EU citizens in the UK post-Brexit. Addressed early in Brexit negotiations, both sides have established positions: the EU through a Council decision outlining the mandate for Commission negotiators on May 22, and the UK through a government proposal on June 26. Despite claims to the contrary, the UK&amp;rsquo;s proposal didn&amp;rsquo;t precede the EU&amp;rsquo;s stance...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-initial-stances-on-the-status-of-uk-and-eu-citizens-in-the-brexit-negotiations/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-initial-stances-on-the-status-of-uk-and-eu-citizens-in-the-brexit-negotiations/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Love triumphs in the CJEU: Equal Marriage and EU Freedom of Movement Legislation</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/love-triumphs-in-the-cjeu-equal-marriage-and-eu-freedom-of-movement-legislation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 09:22:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/love-triumphs-in-the-cjeu-equal-marriage-and-eu-freedom-of-movement-legislation/</guid><description>Professor Steve Peers, Law School, University of Essex
The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) issued its first ruling on same-sex marriage within the framework of EU free movement law in the case of Coman.

The European Commission recently issued a communication and recommendation addressing the loss of voting rights for EU citizens who relocate to other Member States. The Commission acknowledges that national identity grants Member States the right to determine voter eligibility. However, they urge Member States to consider if their policies on disenfranchisement hinder political participation. The Commission argues that many citizens maintain an interest in their home country&amp;rsquo;s politics, staying informed about political developments is easier than ever, and there&amp;rsquo;s a growing trend towards allowing expatriates to vote...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-fair-for-eu-citizens-who-relocate-to-still-have-the-right-to-vote-in-their-home-country/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-fair-for-eu-citizens-who-relocate-to-still-have-the-right-to-vote-in-their-home-country/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Restrictions on extradition to countries outside the EU due to EU citizenship.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/restrictions-on-extradition-to-countries-outside-the-eu-due-to-eu-citizenship/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Aug 2023 18:40:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/restrictions-on-extradition-to-countries-outside-the-eu-due-to-eu-citizenship/</guid><description>Steve Peers
While the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) is a well-known EU law that streamlined extradition between member states, EU law generally doesn&amp;rsquo;t govern extradition to non-EU nations. Exceptions exist in cases of pre-existing treaties, like those with the USA and Norway/Iceland, or regarding asylum seekers. The EU&amp;rsquo;s asylum laws restrict extraditing asylum-seekers before determining if the requesting country intends to persecute them.

Introduction
How does the UK&amp;rsquo;s membership in the European Union (EU) affect immigration and asylum? This piece examines this complex topic, focusing on migration to the UK by both non-EU and EU citizens.
Non-EU migration
It&amp;rsquo;s crucial to differentiate between non-EU and EU migration in the Brexit referendum discussion for two key reasons. Firstly, while EU migration is inherently linked to the UK&amp;rsquo;s EU membership, non-EU migration is not...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/briefing-4-immigration-in-the-eu-referendum/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/briefing-4-immigration-in-the-eu-referendum/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The immigration issues in the UK renegotiation deal have been finalized.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-immigration-issues-in-the-uk-renegotiation-deal-have-been-finalized/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jul 2023 20:52:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-immigration-issues-in-the-uk-renegotiation-deal-have-been-finalized/</guid><description>Steve Peers*
David Cameron has successfully negotiated a deal regarding the UK&amp;rsquo;s membership in the EU. This post, the first in a series about the deal, focuses on &amp;ldquo;EU immigration&amp;rdquo; or, in terms of EU law, the free movement of EU citizens. I will delve into other important matters (competitiveness, Eurozone relations, sovereignty) and the legal structure of the deal later.
The deal comprises seven legal documents: a Decision by the EU Member States&amp;rsquo; Heads of State and Government (the &amp;ldquo;Decision&amp;rdquo;); a Statement from the Heads of State and Government (an agreed Council Decision); a Declaration by the European Council (representing the EU Member States&amp;rsquo; Heads of State and Government); and four declarations by the Commission...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-immigration-issues-in-the-uk-renegotiation-deal-have-been-finalized/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-immigration-issues-in-the-uk-renegotiation-deal-have-been-finalized/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Following the Dano ruling, under what circumstances can unemployed EU citizens be deported?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/following-the-dano-ruling-under-what-circumstances-can-unemployed-eu-citizens-be-deported/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jul 2023 13:30:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/following-the-dano-ruling-under-what-circumstances-can-unemployed-eu-citizens-be-deported/</guid><description>Steve Peers
The recent Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decision in the Dano case focused on benefit applications, not deportation. Therefore, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t directly affect deportation. However, due to the Court&amp;rsquo;s interpretation of the EU citizens&amp;rsquo; Directive, it might indirectly impact deportation.
Earlier this year, I published a blog post about when unemployment could justify deporting or banning EU citizens.

Cameron also outlined two planned changes to UK law regarding the EU Charter of Rights and potentially the role of UK courts in reviewing EU court decisions.

EU citizens with family members who are non-EU citizens often face obstacles to free movement, especially when those family members are from Asia, Africa, or the Caribbean. Traveling outside of the Schengen area with these family members often requires obtaining visas, adding complexity to their trips.

The question of legal recognition for same-sex relationships has become a major topic in recent decades, sparking intense discussions globally in legislative bodies, courts, and the media, with strong opinions on both sides.

The European Commission&amp;rsquo;s recent draft of the Brexit withdrawal agreement might encounter obstacles and potentially fail to gain approval due to conflicting viewpoints on the Irish border or other matters.

EU freedom of movement laws don&amp;rsquo;t directly apply to non-EU citizens. Instead, they gain rights through family ties with EU citizens. This poses a problem in domestic violence situations where the abuser is an EU citizen and the victim is not. Leaving the abuser could lead to expulsion, forcing victims to choose between their safety and remaining in the country, potentially separated from their children.
EU law attempts to mitigate this risk...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-ruling-on-domestic-violence-and-the-free-movement-of-eu-citizens-is-disgraceful/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-ruling-on-domestic-violence-and-the-free-movement-of-eu-citizens-is-disgraceful/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The ECJ shows no sympathy for expelling war criminals who are EU citizens.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-ecj-shows-no-sympathy-for-expelling-war-criminals-who-are-eu-citizens/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Nov 2022 21:17:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-ecj-shows-no-sympathy-for-expelling-war-criminals-who-are-eu-citizens/</guid><description>Professor Steve Peers, University of Essex
The European Court of Justice (ECJ) recently clarified the circumstances under which an EU citizen or their family member can be expelled from a Member State after being denied refugee status. This landmark judgment sheds light on the intersection of EU (and international) refugee law and EU free movement law, a relationship previously unaddressed in the Court&amp;rsquo;s case law.
This lack of legal precedent stems from EU law&amp;rsquo;s attempt to separate these two areas...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-ecj-shows-no-sympathy-for-expelling-war-criminals-who-are-eu-citizens/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-ecj-shows-no-sympathy-for-expelling-war-criminals-who-are-eu-citizens/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Ensuring the right to a nationality for children of same-sex couples in the EU - A crucial matter in the case of V.M.A. v Stolichna Obsthina (C-490/20) before the CJEU.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ensuring-the-right-to-a-nationality-for-children-of-same-sex-couples-in-the-eu-a-crucial-matter-in-the-case-of-v-m-a-v-stolichna-obsthina-c-490-20-before-the-cjeu/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Nov 2022 09:11:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ensuring-the-right-to-a-nationality-for-children-of-same-sex-couples-in-the-eu-a-crucial-matter-in-the-case-of-v-m-a-v-stolichna-obsthina-c-490-20-before-the-cjeu/</guid><description>Patrícia Cabral, Legal Policy Officer, European Network on Statelessness*
The recognition of LGBTQ* rights, including same-sex partnerships or marriages and legal parentage for same-sex couples, varies significantly across Europe. This inconsistent landscape presents challenges for rainbow families (families with at least one LGBTQ* parent), particularly regarding the legal recognition of their civil status, birth registration processes, and access to birth certificates. Consequently, some children in these families face statelessness or a heightened risk of it...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ensuring-the-right-to-a-nationality-for-children-of-same-sex-couples-in-the-eu-a-crucial-matter-in-the-case-of-v-m-a-v-stolichna-obsthina-c-490-20-before-the-cjeu/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ensuring-the-right-to-a-nationality-for-children-of-same-sex-couples-in-the-eu-a-crucial-matter-in-the-case-of-v-m-a-v-stolichna-obsthina-c-490-20-before-the-cjeu/</a></p></description></item><item><title>EU Citizens' Family Reunion: A third-country national family member who is separated from an EU citizen can obtain permanent residency status.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/eu-citizens-family-reunion-a-third-country-national-family-member-who-is-separated-from-an-eu-citizen-can-obtain-permanent-residency-status/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Nov 2022 11:31:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/eu-citizens-family-reunion-a-third-country-national-family-member-who-is-separated-from-an-eu-citizen-can-obtain-permanent-residency-status/</guid><description>Chiara Berneri, Lecturer at BPP Law School
Article 16(2) of the EU citizens’ Directive (Directive 2004/38) outlines that non-EU family members of EU citizens residing in another EU country can obtain permanent residency, which provides stronger protection against deportation, if they have lived legally with the EU citizen continuously for five years.

If British pro-Europeans could travel back in time, their priority should be returning to 2004. They should focus all efforts on persuading the then-British government to reconsider granting immediate free movement of workers from new EU member states. While economically advantageous, this decision has severely damaged public support for EU membership in the UK, as well as for the UK Labour Party.
Today, the free movement of people is often framed as a fundamental flaw within the EU, prompting calls for the UK to either leave or renegotiate its terms...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-cameron-s-emergency-brake-preserving-or-abolishing-the-free-movement-of-people/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-cameron-s-emergency-brake-preserving-or-abolishing-the-free-movement-of-people/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Unemployed EU citizens may benefit from the CJEU's decision, potentially complicating David Cameron's renegotiation strategy.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/unemployed-eu-citizens-may-benefit-from-the-cjeu-s-decision-potentially-complicating-david-cameron-s-renegotiation-strategy/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Oct 2022 18:18:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/unemployed-eu-citizens-may-benefit-from-the-cjeu-s-decision-potentially-complicating-david-cameron-s-renegotiation-strategy/</guid><description>Steve Peers
The ability of EU citizens to move freely between Member States, often referred to as ‘immigration,’ has sparked significant political debate, particularly in the UK. Access to benefits for these individuals remains a point of contention. The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has an opportunity to provide clarity on key aspects of this issue in the upcoming case of Alimanovic.

The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), through its judgment in the Ruffer case, reinforced and broadened its stance on using minority languages in legal processes.
The case involved Mrs. Ruffer, a German citizen residing in Germany, who was injured in a skiing incident in Bolzano, Italy, a region where German is commonly spoken.

Typically, EU law doesn&amp;rsquo;t grant residency rights to non-EU family members of EU citizens residing in their own home country. However, recent court rulings have clarified two key exceptions to this rule, albeit with unexpected outcomes. These rulings stem from Advocate-General Sharpston&amp;rsquo;s December 2013 opinion, as discussed in a prior blog entry.

A primary criticism of the European Union is its tendency to involve itself in matters that initially appear outside its defined powers, as outlined in Articles 3 to 6 of the TFEU.
The principle of attributed powers is embedded in EU law and acknowledged as legally binding to ensure the EU operates as a &amp;ldquo;rule of law&amp;rdquo; entity (Les Verts judgment). However, this has not prevented the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) from broadly interpreting its jurisdictional authority concerning EU law...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/no-one-will-know-his-name-an-analysis-of-the-cjeu-ruling-on-the-use-of-names-acknowledged-by-other-member-states/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/no-one-will-know-his-name-an-analysis-of-the-cjeu-ruling-on-the-use-of-names-acknowledged-by-other-member-states/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Irreconcilable Disagreements: The Impact of Divorce and Departure of EU Citizens According to the Citizens' Directive</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/irreconcilable-disagreements-the-impact-of-divorce-and-departure-of-eu-citizens-according-to-the-citizens-directive/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jun 2022 18:55:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/irreconcilable-disagreements-the-impact-of-divorce-and-departure-of-eu-citizens-according-to-the-citizens-directive/</guid><description>Steve Peers
A complex situation arises when an EU citizen, residing in another Member State, divorces a non-EU spouse after the EU citizen has left that Member State. The EU Citizens’ Directive provides rules for divorce and departure, but these rules seem contradictory. An Advocate-General&amp;rsquo;s opinion in the significant Singh case tackles these issues, as does a pending reference from the UK. However, this opinion is fundamentally flawed, and the Court of Justice should consider a different approach...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/irreconcilable-disagreements-the-impact-of-divorce-and-departure-of-eu-citizens-according-to-the-citizens-directive/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/irreconcilable-disagreements-the-impact-of-divorce-and-departure-of-eu-citizens-according-to-the-citizens-directive/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Analysis of an Advocate-General's opinion reveals that Brexit will result in the end of EU citizenship for UK nationals.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/analysis-of-an-advocate-general-s-opinion-reveals-that-brexit-will-result-in-the-end-of-eu-citizenship-for-uk-nationals/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jun 2022 11:26:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/analysis-of-an-advocate-general-s-opinion-reveals-that-brexit-will-result-in-the-end-of-eu-citizenship-for-uk-nationals/</guid><description>Professor Steve Peers, University of Essex
The question of whether British citizens retained their EU citizenship after Brexit is disputed. While the EU and UK governments assert that they did not, some British individuals disagree.
This issue has been raised before EU courts through various avenues. Three cases directly appealed to the EU General Court, contesting the EU Council&amp;rsquo;s decision to finalize the withdrawal agreement. These appeals argued that the agreement improperly revoked their EU citizenship...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/analysis-of-an-advocate-general-s-opinion-reveals-that-brexit-will-result-in-the-end-of-eu-citizenship-for-uk-nationals/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/analysis-of-an-advocate-general-s-opinion-reveals-that-brexit-will-result-in-the-end-of-eu-citizenship-for-uk-nationals/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the temporary free movement rights of third-country family members of EU citizens.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-court-of-justice-of-the-european-union-cjeu-has-upheld-the-temporary-free-movement-rights-of-third-country-family-members-of-eu-citizens/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 May 2022 00:45:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-court-of-justice-of-the-european-union-cjeu-has-upheld-the-temporary-free-movement-rights-of-third-country-family-members-of-eu-citizens/</guid><description>Steve Peers
