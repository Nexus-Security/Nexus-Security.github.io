He highlights the Council of Europe&amp;rsquo;s recent Convention aimed at tackling this issue, while also pointing out Malta&amp;rsquo;s legal challenge against it at the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). Malta argues that the treaty clashes with internal market rules, particularly the freedom to provide services, underscoring the difficulties in achieving a unified international response to match-fixing.</description></item><item><title>A Story of Two Institutions: Regulation of Hate Speech in Europe</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-story-of-two-institutions-regulation-of-hate-speech-in-europe/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Mar 2024 02:22:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/a-story-of-two-institutions-regulation-of-hate-speech-in-europe/</guid><description>Clotilde PÃ©gorier, Lecturer in Law, University of Essex

The detention of migrants is a contentious issue in immigration and asylum law. This involves detaining individuals who haven&amp;rsquo;t committed crimes other than potential immigration violations. They are held during their asylum application process or while awaiting deportation. The EU has established regulations on detaining irregular migrants through the Returns Directive. For insight into the Court of Justice of the European Union&amp;rsquo;s (CJEU) interpretation of these regulations, refer to the journal article on humane treatment versus efficient removal.</description></item></channel></rss>
