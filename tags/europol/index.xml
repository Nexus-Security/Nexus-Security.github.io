The Danish Prime Minister recently revealed that Denmark would hold a referendum in 2015 regarding its relationship with the EU. While widely reported as a vote on rejoining EU Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) law, the referendum actually focuses on replacing Denmark&amp;rsquo;s complete opt-out with a selective one. This post will examine the details of this issue, including which measures Denmark could potentially opt back into.
The origin of this opt-out can be traced back to the 1992 Danish referendum on the Maastricht Treaty.</description></item><item><title>The Evolution of EU Criminal Law in 2014</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-evolution-of-eu-criminal-law-in-2014/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Feb 2024 06:09:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-evolution-of-eu-criminal-law-in-2014/</guid><description>Steve Peers
The year 2014 was significant for the European Union, marked by events such as European Parliament elections, the establishment of a new European Commission, and notable legislative and case-law developments. This post, the first in a series, reviews key developments in specific EU law areas.
The most substantial change in EU criminal law occurred on December 1st, ending the five-year transition period for EU criminal law measures enacted before the Lisbon Treaty came into effect.</description></item><item><title>Is Europol's Joint and Several Liability Regime Transforming Responsibility for EU Fundamental Rights?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-europol-s-joint-and-several-liability-regime-transforming-responsibility-for-eu-fundamental-rights/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Nov 2023 03:32:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-europol-s-joint-and-several-liability-regime-transforming-responsibility-for-eu-fundamental-rights/</guid><description>Dr Joyce de Coninck, University of Ghent

This developing system of liability is at the center of the Marián Kočner v Europol case, highlighting the need for clarity regarding joint responsibility for human rights violations when EU agencies and Member States collaborate.</description></item><item><title>Assessing the Commission's Proposal to Enhance Europol's Authority: A Review of the Amendment to Regulation (EU) 2016/784 (Europol Regulation)</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/assessing-the-commission-s-proposal-to-enhance-europol-s-authority-a-review-of-the-amendment-to-regulation-eu-2016-784-europol-regulation/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jun 2023 13:29:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/assessing-the-commission-s-proposal-to-enhance-europol-s-authority-a-review-of-the-amendment-to-regulation-eu-2016-784-europol-regulation/</guid><description>Niovi Vavoula and Valsamis Mitsilegas, Queen Mary University
Introduction The European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol) plays a crucial role in supporting EU Member States&amp;rsquo; cross-border police cooperation, as defined by Regulation (EU) 2016/794 (Europol Regulation). Referred to as the EU&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;criminal information hub,&amp;rsquo; Europol facilitates information exchange between Member States, Europol itself, other EU bodies, international organizations, and third countries. It also generates criminal intelligence using information from various sources, including Member States and partners.</description></item><item><title>Details of the upcoming referendum on Denmark's participation in EU Justice and Home Affairs Law.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/details-of-the-upcoming-referendum-on-denmark-s-participation-in-eu-justice-and-home-affairs-law/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 May 2023 11:53:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/details-of-the-upcoming-referendum-on-denmark-s-participation-in-eu-justice-and-home-affairs-law/</guid><description>Steve Peers
Denmark&amp;rsquo;s involvement in international criminal law, exemplified by the TV show &amp;ldquo;The Bridge,&amp;rdquo; is facing uncertainty due to changing EU regulations. This situation will soon lead Denmark to vote on modifying its current near-total opt-out of EU Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) laws. While the general implications have been discussed, the specifics of this vote are now clearer.
To recap, Denmark negotiated opt-outs from the euro, defense, and parts of JHA law in 1992.</description></item><item><title>European Union Migration Agencies: Frontex, EASO, and Europol's Operations and Collaborations</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/european-union-migration-agencies-frontex-easo-and-europol-s-operations-and-collaborations/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Mar 2023 18:58:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/european-union-migration-agencies-frontex-easo-and-europol-s-operations-and-collaborations/</guid><description>Dr. David Fernández-Rojo, Universidad de Deusto - davidfrojo@deusto.es
The recent surge in migration, often called the “refugee crisis,” highlighted the urgent need to strengthen both the Schengen area and the Common European Asylum System (CEAS). It also underscored the need to support EU member states dealing with large numbers of migrants and to consistently apply EU policies on migration, asylum, and border control. EU agencies such as Frontex, EASO, and Europol have become central to these efforts.</description></item></channel></rss>
