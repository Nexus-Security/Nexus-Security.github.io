I&amp;rsquo;m seeking creative solutions, even if they&amp;rsquo;re unconventional, for two specific Management Reporter issues:
Implementing Management Reporter in environments without a domain or Active Directory. Managing high-volume reporting, including generating reports for online viewing in the library and printing them for physical distribution. Although I know these aren&amp;rsquo;t currently supported, I&amp;rsquo;m interested in hearing from anyone who has developed workarounds or alternative approaches for their clients.</description></item></channel></rss>
