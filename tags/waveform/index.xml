Replacing the electrolytic capacitors helped but didn&amp;rsquo;t solve the problem completely. To investigate further, I examined the motor voltage and the signal waveform from the Wien bridge oscillator, a clever design that uses an incandescent light bulb as a variable resistor for amplitude control. I measured the AC waveform amplitude at one of the motor leads relative to ground.</description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Reservoir and Motor Phase Capacitors Replacement</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-reservoir-and-motor-phase-capacitors-replacement/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Nov 2022 20:25:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-reservoir-and-motor-phase-capacitors-replacement/</guid><description>I recently provided a customer with replacement capacitors for his Beogram 4000 turntable, along with a 3D-printed adapter I designed.
He had been experiencing problems with the motor, as it was only displaying half waveforms. This suggested an issue with either the phase capacitor or the power supply reservoir capacitors. After installing the new components, the problem was completely resolved. You can find more details about this process in my original post here: link to my original post about this procedure.</description></item></channel></rss>
