Deciding between these options involves weighing performance, cost, and installation time. Focusing solely on cost can lead to extended installation delays, potentially impacting operational needs. While a cost-effective solution might be suitable with ample planning time, immediate bandwidth demands may necessitate prioritizing availability over cost...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/choosing-dark-fiber-vs-lit-fiber-service/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/choosing-dark-fiber-vs-lit-fiber-service/</a></p></description></item><item><title>WDM Wavelength Services Offer Expandability</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/wdm-wavelength-services-offer-expandability/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Mar 2024 05:37:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/wdm-wavelength-services-offer-expandability/</guid><description>For those seeking high bandwidth, security, and adaptable network solutions, wavelength services present an attractive option, going beyond typical fiber optic bandwidth.
Fiber optic transmission offers nearly limitless bandwidthâ€”a stark contrast to copper wireline services. However, even with fiber optic services, users typically select a fixed bandwidth level. This limits them, as upgrading often becomes the only way to obtain additional bandwidth when needed. In reality, these services utilize only a fraction of the fiber&amp;rsquo;s total capacity...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/wdm-wavelength-services-offer-expandability/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/wdm-wavelength-services-offer-expandability/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Fiber Optic DWDM Up to 100 Gbps Per Wavelength</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/fiber-optic-dwdm-up-to-100-gbps-per-wavelength/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Aug 2023 09:44:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/fiber-optic-dwdm-up-to-100-gbps-per-wavelength/</guid><description>The demand for bandwidth keeps increasing, even during economic slowdowns. The main reason is the huge popularity of video, especially high-definition video, which needs a lot of bandwidth on all types of networks. Now, fiber optic systems using DWDM (Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing) can handle 100 Gbps per wavelength.
It seems like just yesterday we were excited about moving from 10 Gbps to 40 Gbps channels. Now, Alcatel-Lucent offers an upgrade that handles both 40 Gbps and 100 Gbps on a single optical carrier for their 1830 Photonic Service Switch (PSS)...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/fiber-optic-dwdm-up-to-100-gbps-per-wavelength/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/fiber-optic-dwdm-up-to-100-gbps-per-wavelength/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
