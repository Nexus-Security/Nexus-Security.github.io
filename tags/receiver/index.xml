This piece fits into a 10mm opening on the remote control receiver board, allowing it to be secured using one of the main PCB&amp;rsquo;s screws. The image below shows the part with the screw in place:
Once the remote control board is in place, the original screw can be used to fasten it. The cylindrical portion is designed to prevent the remote board from pressing against the component pins on the Beogram&amp;rsquo;s main PCB while ensuring a secure fit...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-remote-control-final-3d-printed-part-added/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-remote-control-final-3d-printed-part-added/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513) Remote Control: Now With a 3D Printed Installation Tray</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-remote-control-now-with-a-3d-printed-installation-tray/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Dec 2023 09:02:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-remote-control-now-with-a-3d-printed-installation-tray/</guid><description>This post continues the discussion about my Beogram 4002 (5513) remote control upgrade, specifically the receiver board insulation. My previous solution, using plastic foil, wasn&amp;rsquo;t ideal aesthetically.
To address this, I designed a plastic tray that safeguards the receiver board from the main circuit board&amp;rsquo;s solder points. The tray is designed to click into place without additional screws.
Here are some photos:
Tray and board before assembly:
The tray features three rectangular cutouts to provide clearance for the solder points...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-remote-control-now-with-a-3d-printed-installation-tray/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-remote-control-now-with-a-3d-printed-installation-tray/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (Type 5504): Installation of Commander Remote Control Module</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5504-installation-of-commander-remote-control-module/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Sep 2023 17:24:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5504-installation-of-commander-remote-control-module/</guid><description>This article details the installation of a Beolover Commander Remote Control Module into a Beogram 4002 (Type 5504) turntable.

The relay design I created for the Beogram 4000 also worked in this model. Hereâ€™s the replacement board:

Designed for later models of the 4002 turntable with the keypad connector on the main circuit board (types 551x and 552x), I recently built three receivers over the weekend and shipped them out today, each packaged with a compatible Apple remote:..<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-commander-remote-control-installation-video/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-commander-remote-control-installation-video/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513) Remote Control: Now With a Professionally Made PCB</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-remote-control-now-with-a-professionally-made-pcb/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 May 2023 13:38:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-remote-control-now-with-a-professionally-made-pcb/</guid><description>I recently had a professionally made circuit board manufactured for the remote control receiver in my Beogram 4002 (5513).
