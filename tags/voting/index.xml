Yet, the UK government&amp;rsquo;s announcement regarding voting eligibility for the EU Referendum unexpectedly became a hot topic in May 2015. This announcement aimed to quell the growing debate on the issue.
The announcement declared that the referendum would utilize a modified Westminster franchise, resembling the UK&amp;rsquo;s national election system...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/who-is-eligible-to-vote-in-the-eu-referendum/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/who-is-eligible-to-vote-in-the-eu-referendum/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Is it fair for EU citizens who relocate to still have the right to vote in their home country?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-fair-for-eu-citizens-who-relocate-to-still-have-the-right-to-vote-in-their-home-country/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Aug 2023 02:40:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-it-fair-for-eu-citizens-who-relocate-to-still-have-the-right-to-vote-in-their-home-country/</guid><description>Steve Peers
The European Commission recently issued a communication and recommendation addressing the loss of voting rights for EU citizens who relocate to other Member States. The Commission acknowledges that national identity grants Member States the right to determine voter eligibility. However, they urge Member States to consider if their policies on disenfranchisement hinder political participation.

The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has affirmed that UK citizens lost EU citizenship due to Brexit, as per a recent judgment. This aligns with the earlier Advocate-Generalâ€™s opinion. While other similar cases exist, the CJEU is unlikely to deviate from this decision.
This judgment is notable for its dismissal of arguments advocating for the retention of EU citizenship for British citizens, marking a significant shift...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/it-s-finally-here-the-cjeu-has-confirmed-that-uk-citizens-have-officially-lost-their-eu-citizenship/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/it-s-finally-here-the-cjeu-has-confirmed-that-uk-citizens-have-officially-lost-their-eu-citizenship/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
