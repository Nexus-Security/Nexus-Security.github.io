During my standard pre-restoration test using a Beogram 4002, this motor was unusually sluggish, only operating with assistance. This contrasted with the typical DC motors I encounter, which generally run powerfully but exhibit RPM fluctuations and often produce high-pitched sounds due to dried-out bearings. This particular motor was noticeably underpowered.
I disassembled the motor and performed my usual bearing oil infusion to ensure the mechanical components were within specifications before addressing the sluggishness.</description></item></channel></rss>
