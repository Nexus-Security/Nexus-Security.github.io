Ethernet over Copper (EoC) connections are increasing in availability and often come at a lower cost compared to other options.
EoC enables standard Ethernet services to be delivered through existing copper telephone wiring. Unlike typical Cat 5E or Cat 6 wiring, EoC is compatible with older copper infrastructure not initially intended for Ethernet.</description></item><item><title>How Growing Companies Buy Bandwidth</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/how-growing-companies-buy-bandwidth/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jan 2023 01:55:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/how-growing-companies-buy-bandwidth/</guid><description>As businesses recover and grow, they&amp;rsquo;ll need more resources. But with economic uncertainty, it&amp;rsquo;s wise to expand cautiously. Is that even possible with bandwidth?
Yes, it is. Traditional telecom contracts lock you into a service level for 1 to 3 years. For example, a T1 line provides a fixed 1.5 Mbps bandwidth for a monthly fee. Doubling bandwidth means another T1 line. These lines can be &amp;lsquo;bonded&amp;rsquo; for combined bandwidth, either by the provider or using devices like Mushroom Networks&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;Truffle.</description></item></channel></rss>
