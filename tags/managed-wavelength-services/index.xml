This leads IT departments to consider purchasing or leasing dark fiber for enhanced bandwidth, latency, and control. However, there&amp;rsquo;s another option worth exploring: managed wavelength services.
In simple terms, a wavelength is a distinct color or lambda on a fiber optic strand. Fiber optic lines transmit multiple light beams simultaneously, with each color representing a unique wavelength or frequency of laser light...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/private-networking-with-wavelength-services/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/private-networking-with-wavelength-services/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Ethernet over Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (EoDWDM)</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-over-dense-wavelength-division-multiplexing-eodwdm-/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Aug 2023 11:43:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-over-dense-wavelength-division-multiplexing-eodwdm-/</guid><description>Large organizations with high bandwidth needs, such as financial institutions and research labs, often require more capacity than standard telecom services offer. Building a custom fiber network by installing owned or leased dark fiber is one solution. Another is leasing wavelengths on existing fiber infrastructure.
Your Own Fiber Installing fiber optic cable on your own property provides control over both the physical space and network assets. However, construction costs increase significantly beyond your premises, especially when obtaining right-of-way permissions...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-over-dense-wavelength-division-multiplexing-eodwdm-/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-over-dense-wavelength-division-multiplexing-eodwdm-/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
