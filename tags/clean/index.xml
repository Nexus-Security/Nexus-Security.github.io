Kimberly-Clark&amp;rsquo;s toilet tissue brand, Kleenex, has released findings about Australian attitudes towards cleanliness alongside their new Kleenex Luxury Collection.
Nearly one-third of Australians (32%) believe they could be cleaner.
Over 80% (84%) would avoid a first date if they didn&amp;rsquo;t feel clean.
Feeling clean significantly impacts emotions: Australians associate cleanliness with feeling refreshed (84%) and more confident (48%).
When compared to topics like sex, religion, politics, and finances, half of those surveyed found &amp;ldquo;cleaning your intimate area&amp;rdquo; the most difficult to discuss.</description></item></channel></rss>
