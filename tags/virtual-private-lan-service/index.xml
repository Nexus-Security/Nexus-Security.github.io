Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) offers a solution. While not a fully private cloud, it comes close.
VPLS allows you to share a private multipoint network built on technology like Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS). MPLS networks can handle various traffic types, including Ethernet, making it ideal for diverse needs...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/vpls-is-the-ethernet-cloud/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/vpls-is-the-ethernet-cloud/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Ethernet In The First Mile Advantages</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-in-the-first-mile-advantages/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2024 20:19:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-in-the-first-mile-advantages/</guid><description>Metropolitan and Wide Area Networks can send your data anywhere you want. To access these networks, you need a connection known as &amp;ldquo;first mile&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;last mile&amp;rdquo; connectivity. Ethernet offers advantages for this first mile link.
Several technologies, such as T1 lines, DSL, SONET fiber optic services, and even microwave or 3G/4G wireless, work well for first mile connections. These options connect your building to your service provider or a gateway to their network...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-in-the-first-mile-advantages/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/ethernet-in-the-first-mile-advantages/</a></p></description></item><item><title>VPLS Connects Your Many LANs</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/vpls-connects-your-many-lans/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Aug 2022 21:47:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/vpls-connects-your-many-lans/</guid><description>Do you have multiple offices in your company? It&amp;rsquo;s likely that each office has its own local network for computers and potentially even internet-based phone systems. The question then becomes, how do you link these separate networks together?
The solution, unfortunately, is often complex and costly.
However, there&amp;rsquo;s a way to simplify this process and potentially save money compared to your current individual connections: VPLS, or Virtual Private LAN Service. This service is provided by companies like Layer2 Communications and other competitive network providers...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/vpls-connects-your-many-lans/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/vpls-connects-your-many-lans/</a></p></description></item><item><title>VPLS over MPLS Connects Locations Worldwide</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/vpls-over-mpls-connects-locations-worldwide/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jul 2022 10:10:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/vpls-over-mpls-connects-locations-worldwide/</guid><description>Older technologies like frame relay and TDM point-to-point connections are being replaced by MPLS networks. This shift from switched circuit to packet-switched networks reflects the declining significance of traditional telephone traffic in global voice, data, and video communication.
MPLS&amp;rsquo;s adaptability makes it the preferred WAN technology. The acronym&amp;rsquo;s MP stands for Multi-Protocol, signifying its ability to handle various traffic types. By attaching a label to each packet, MPLS ensures seamless transmission from origin to destination via Label Switching (LS)...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/vpls-over-mpls-connects-locations-worldwide/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/vpls-over-mpls-connects-locations-worldwide/</a></p></description></item><item><title>What is VPLS Bringing to MPLS Networks?</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-is-vpls-bringing-to-mpls-networks/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 May 2022 23:50:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-is-vpls-bringing-to-mpls-networks/</guid><description>Businesses with numerous branches have embraced MPLS networks for their affordability and high performance in connecting multiple locations. However, they may be overlooking a superior connectivity solution: Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS).
Essentially, VPLS is an Ethernet transport service operating over existing MPLS networks, enhancing rather than replacing them.
What sets VPLS apart is its ability to unify all your individual LANs into a single, company-wide network. This network transcends geographical limitations, enabling international connections for globally distributed businesses...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-is-vpls-bringing-to-mpls-networks/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/what-is-vpls-bringing-to-mpls-networks/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
