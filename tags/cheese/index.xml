This trend is linked to a growing consumer preference for preparing Western dishes, such as pizzas, pastas, cakes, pastries, and toast, which often feature cheese, within their own homes, as indicated by research conducted by Euromonitor. A notable shift in preference is the rising popularity of cheese paired with white bread, replacing traditional spreads like chocolate sprinkles, jam, or honey.</description></item></channel></rss>
