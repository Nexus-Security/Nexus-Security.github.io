The creators of the Mouse Glove claim their invention offers a more ergonomic and intuitive user experience compared to traditional mice. By promoting a more natural hand position, they believe it can reduce the risk of repetitive strain injuries like carpal tunnel syndrome.
The glove replicates standard mouse functionalities, including left and right clicks, scrolling, and cursor control.</description></item></channel></rss>
