The UK&amp;rsquo;s departure from the European Union has resulted in the first instance of regulatory divergence. As the UK exits the single market, existing regulations are starting to show cracks.
In response to a question from MP Jo Stevens, former Intellectual Property Minister Chris Skidmore indicated the UK would not implement the latest EU Copyright Directive, despite the UK&amp;rsquo;s prior support for it in the EU Council...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/divergence-in-regulations-after-brexit-copyright-law-as-a-preview-of-future-changes/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/divergence-in-regulations-after-brexit-copyright-law-as-a-preview-of-future-changes/</a></p></description></item><item><title>The CJEU ruling in McFadden: Public Wi-Fi and Responsibility for Unauthorized Downloads</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-ruling-in-mcfadden-public-wi-fi-and-responsibility-for-unauthorized-downloads/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2024 16:12:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-ruling-in-mcfadden-public-wi-fi-and-responsibility-for-unauthorized-downloads/</guid><description>Lorna Woods, Professor of Internet Law, University of Essex
A recent Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) case, McFadden, examined whether businesses offering free wi-fi are responsible for customers&amp;rsquo; illegal downloads. This case centered around Article 12 of the EU&amp;rsquo;s eCommerce Directive, which protects &amp;ldquo;mere conduits&amp;rdquo; of information from liability. While generally aligning with existing laws, the ruling raised potentially significant points regarding injunction costs and internet access provision requirements...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-ruling-in-mcfadden-public-wi-fi-and-responsibility-for-unauthorized-downloads/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-ruling-in-mcfadden-public-wi-fi-and-responsibility-for-unauthorized-downloads/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Singapore has modified its regulations for the protection of designs</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/singapore-has-modified-its-regulations-for-the-protection-of-designs/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 03:26:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/singapore-has-modified-its-regulations-for-the-protection-of-designs/</guid><description>Singapore&amp;rsquo;s Ministry of Law (MinLaw) has introduced the Registered Designs (Amendment) Bill to Parliament for its first reading.

Introduction
In September 2014, Mike Dicks created a Twitter account called ‘UKIP Trumpton’. The account bio stated ‘After the recent defection of the Mayor of Trumpton and Mr Troop the town clerk this is the new home of UKIP tweets from Trumptonshire’ and used the official UKIP logo. Dicks later explained that the account was meant to gently mock UKIP, drawing a parallel between the party&amp;rsquo;s vision and the classic children&amp;rsquo;s show &amp;ldquo;Trumpton,&amp;rdquo; which lacked diversity...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/has-ukip-completely-lost-its-sense-of-humor-another-satirical-story/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/has-ukip-completely-lost-its-sense-of-humor-another-satirical-story/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Could this be a parody?

Jacques highlights the timely relevance of the opinion, given the ongoing debate over copyright exceptions and the delayed implementation of a parody exception in the UK...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/could-this-be-a-parody-the-advocate-general-s-viewpoint-on-the-deckmyn-case/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/could-this-be-a-parody-the-advocate-general-s-viewpoint-on-the-deckmyn-case/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Local computer vendor in Singapore raided by police, counterfeit Microsoft software discovered</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/local-computer-vendor-in-singapore-raided-by-police-counterfeit-microsoft-software-discovered/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Feb 2023 14:28:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/local-computer-vendor-in-singapore-raided-by-police-counterfeit-microsoft-software-discovered/</guid><description>Microsoft is urging consumers and small businesses to be cautious when buying software, warning them about the risks of accidentally purchasing and using counterfeit products.

The Advocate-General recently issued an opinion on parody, sparking significant interest in the topic. This opinion, while not yet available in English, has been the subject of discussion in legal circles.

In the middle of January, Pirate Party Member of European Parliament, Julia Reda, shared a draft of her report examining the implementation of the Information Society Directive 2001/29/EC (often called the &amp;lsquo;InfoSoc Directive&amp;rsquo;). This report has been praised by some as groundbreaking for its progressive stance on copyright in the digital age, while others have criticized it as being too radical or even unacceptable. These strong reactions highlight the widespread interest in the report and its potential impact, particularly within digital rights communities...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-reda-report-a-significant-step-forward-for-the-parody-exception-in-eu-copyright-law/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/is-the-reda-report-a-significant-step-forward-for-the-parody-exception-in-eu-copyright-law/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Trademarks from Asia in a world that is interconnected</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/trademarks-from-asia-in-a-world-that-is-interconnected/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Sep 2022 16:05:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/trademarks-from-asia-in-a-world-that-is-interconnected/</guid><description>Asian brands aiming to go global don&amp;rsquo;t have the luxury of slowly building a reputation over decades, according to experts who spoke at the 136th annual meeting of the International Trademark Association (INTA).

The rise of &amp;ldquo;Web 2.0&amp;rdquo; and social media has enabled widespread content sharing, but also raised questions about managing user rights and the role of online platforms in addressing challenges that their services might facilitate. One issue is the use of filtering technologies, particularly their impact on users&amp;rsquo; freedom of expression.
