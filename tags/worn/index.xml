A common issue with this model, as with approximately 90% of them, is a worn keypad. The original coating deteriorates over time due to exposure to skin oils and acids. This results in unsightly smudges, especially on units that have seen regular use. I recently acquired some refurbished keypads from a contact in Denmark to have on hand for my restoration projects...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-restoration-of-worn-keypad/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-restoration-of-worn-keypad/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5513): Keypad Restoration and LEDs for the RPM Indicators</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-keypad-restoration-and-leds-for-the-rpm-indicators/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Mar 2024 05:30:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-keypad-restoration-and-leds-for-the-rpm-indicators/</guid><description>The Beogram 4002 (5513) I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on had a significantly deteriorated keypad. The material used for these keypads tends to wear down over time due to the oils from fingerprints, making them a known weak point in this model.
My friend in Denmark, who sadly passed away recently, was an expert at restoring these keypads. In his memory, I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to learn his techniques. A couple of months ago, I started practicing, and I managed to successfully restore one keypad...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-keypad-restoration-and-leds-for-the-rpm-indicators/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5513-keypad-restoration-and-leds-for-the-rpm-indicators/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002: Awesome Refurbished Keypads in the House!</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-awesome-refurbished-keypads-in-the-house-/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Aug 2023 06:49:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-awesome-refurbished-keypads-in-the-house-/</guid><description>I received two refurbished Beogram 4002 keypads from Denmark today.

He&amp;rsquo;s incredibly talented! The keypads look brand new, as if they were just made in 1975. He did a phenomenal job. I had sent him a worn-out keypad from a Beogram 4002 I recently restored, and he even found another one!..<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-awesome-refurbished-keypads-in-the-house-/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-awesome-refurbished-keypads-in-the-house-/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (5501): Worn Keypad Restoration - My Process Finally Appears Reproducible...</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5501-worn-keypad-restoration-my-process-finally-appears-reproducible/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Oct 2022 10:30:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5501-worn-keypad-restoration-my-process-finally-appears-reproducible/</guid><description>The Beogram 4002 (5501) I&amp;rsquo;m currently restoring had a common issue: a worn-out keypad. The start button, in particular, was in rough shape due to frequent use.
After a multi-month endeavor, I successfully restored the keypad to an almost-new appearance. My refined restoration method finally produces consistent results, marking a significant step forward in the 4002&amp;rsquo;s rehabilitation.
During the process, I discovered another problem: a broken RPM panel clamp. This prevented the RPM panel from staying securely in place...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5501-worn-keypad-restoration-my-process-finally-appears-reproducible/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-5501-worn-keypad-restoration-my-process-finally-appears-reproducible/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002: Restoration of a Keypad with a Worn Through Start Button</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-restoration-of-a-keypad-with-a-worn-through-start-button/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Aug 2022 09:47:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-restoration-of-a-keypad-with-a-worn-through-start-button/</guid><description>A Beogram 4002 keypad, showing signs of wear, was recently sent from New Zealand. The start button&amp;rsquo;s coating was entirely worn down:
This is a common problem for Beogram keypads. The combination of skin acids and friction wears away the coating.
Fortunately, this is fixable. Here is the keypad after being restored:
It looks great! The coating will be left to harden further before being returned to New Zealand...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-restoration-of-a-keypad-with-a-worn-through-start-button/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-restoration-of-a-keypad-with-a-worn-through-start-button/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
