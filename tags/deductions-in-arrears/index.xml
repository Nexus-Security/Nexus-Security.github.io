One valuable feature that deserves attention is Deductions in Arrears (DIA), introduced in Payroll Extensions for GP 10.0. This feature simplifies payroll processing when dealing with part-time or seasonal employees whose earnings may not cover their deductions.
DIA automatically tracks any deductions that are not fully paid due to insufficient wages. It then recovers these arrears in subsequent payrolls until the obligation is settled.</description></item></channel></rss>
