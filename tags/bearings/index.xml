As shown in the graph, which plots RPM over time, the turntable speed remained relatively stable at the target 33 1/3 RPM, but there were noticeable drops, reaching as low as 30.324 RPM after about three and a half hours.
This result aligns with Beolover&amp;rsquo;s initial findings when testing similar motors. Based on other Beogram DC motor tests conducted by Beolover, it will be revealing to observe the performance of this Beogram after re-lubricating the platter motor bearings.</description></item><item><title>Beocord 9000: Identifying Repairs</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-identifying-repairs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2022 14:05:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beocord-9000-identifying-repairs/</guid><description>Taking apart the tape transport allows for thorough cleaning and reveals hidden areas that require attention. While this approach makes sense for restoration, disassembling most of the transport is necessary anyway for replacing the rubber wheels.
NOTE: It&amp;rsquo;s crucial to avoid disturbing the tape head assembly. It&amp;rsquo;s likely still properly aligned, or very close to it. Unless you&amp;rsquo;re certain they&amp;rsquo;re faulty, there&amp;rsquo;s no need to remove the tape heads at this stage.</description></item></channel></rss>
