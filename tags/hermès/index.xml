Apple has launched new Apple Watch cases and bands, updated its watch operating system, and introduced new gold and rose gold aluminum models for the Apple Watch Sport.
Available as a free update on September 16, the watchOS 2 operating system delivers new features and native third-party apps to Apple Watches. With watchOS 2, apps run faster. Users will also find new watch faces, third-party app information viewable on the watch face, and a &amp;ldquo;Time Travel&amp;rdquo; feature that provides chronological context.</description></item></channel></rss>
