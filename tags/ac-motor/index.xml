The initial setup, including the original reservoir, motor capacitor, and AC platter motor, was documented before removal.
After removing the existing components, new capacitors were installed in a custom-designed 3D printed holder, designed to fit the original strap...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-restoration-of-the-pcbs-and-the-ac-platter-motor/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-restoration-of-the-pcbs-and-the-ac-platter-motor/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4002 (Type 5504): Installation of Newly Adapted Beolover RIAA Pre-Amp</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5504-installation-of-newly-adapted-beolover-riaa-pre-amp/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Apr 2023 13:17:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5504-installation-of-newly-adapted-beolover-riaa-pre-amp/</guid><description>Following the recent redesign of the Beolover internal RIAA pre-amplifier for DC-motor Beogram 4002/4 turntables and its adaptation for the Beogram 4000, the final stage of the design process involved adjusting the circuit for the AC-motor Beogram 4002. The owner of a recently restored 4002 (5504) requested the RIAA installation, making his Beogram the first AC-motor 4002 to feature a Beolover RIAA.
The new board features an input jack that connects to a replicated Beogram-style plug through a multi-lead wiring harness...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5504-installation-of-newly-adapted-beolover-riaa-pre-amp/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4002-type-5504-installation-of-newly-adapted-beolover-riaa-pre-amp/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Reservoir and Motor Phase Capacitors Replacement</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-reservoir-and-motor-phase-capacitors-replacement/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Nov 2022 20:25:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-reservoir-and-motor-phase-capacitors-replacement/</guid><description>I recently provided a customer with replacement capacitors for his Beogram 4000 turntable, along with a 3D-printed adapter I designed.
He had been experiencing problems with the motor, as it was only displaying half waveforms. This suggested an issue with either the phase capacitor or the power supply reservoir capacitors. After installing the new components, the problem was completely resolved.

After rebuilding the boards and motors, I noticed the carriage moved slowly. The 24V rail was only reading 21V, significantly lower than the expected 23.8V.
Then, the arm lowering solenoid began activating erratically when the carriage was touched. It turned out the chassis had a 30V potential relative to the system ground, a dangerous situation.
I found a short circuit between the 24V reservoir capacitor and ground...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-a-fun-time-with-a-suddenly-activating-solenoid-an-anemic-carriage-motor-and-an-ac-motor-driver-with-a-weak-driver-amplitude/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-a-fun-time-with-a-suddenly-activating-solenoid-an-anemic-carriage-motor-and-an-ac-motor-driver-with-a-weak-driver-amplitude/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Beogram 4000: Adjusting the AC Motor Voltage and Measuring the Voltage Differences Between the Phases</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-adjusting-the-ac-motor-voltage-and-measuring-the-voltage-differences-between-the-phases/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jun 2022 19:29:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-adjusting-the-ac-motor-voltage-and-measuring-the-voltage-differences-between-the-phases/</guid><description>During the restoration of a Beogram 4000 turntable, the AC motor requires precise adjustment. The service manual recommends setting the main phase voltage to 6V (RMS) and the frequency to 42.3 Hz for 33 RPM using an oscilloscope. To observe both motor phases, connect the oscilloscope probes across the phase capacitor.
Begin the adjustment by setting the 33 RPM trimmer on the control panel to its neutral position. This allows for fine-tuning the RPM offset potentiometer on the main PCB to achieve the target 42...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-adjusting-the-ac-motor-voltage-and-measuring-the-voltage-differences-between-the-phases/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/beogram-4000-adjusting-the-ac-motor-voltage-and-measuring-the-voltage-differences-between-the-phases/</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
