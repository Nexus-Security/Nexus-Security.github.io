Hervey presents four key arguments: Firstly, the UK, as a long-standing EU member, significantly shaped EU medical training standards. While these standards do influence UK medical qualifications, their impact is limited, and the UK has the authority to propose changes. The current system, including the duration of training, reflects the UK&amp;rsquo;s active participation in shaping these regulations.</description></item></channel></rss>
