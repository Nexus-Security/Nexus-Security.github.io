This begs the question: how impactful will this new technology actually be?
While it&amp;rsquo;s early to definitively say, Bloom Energy&amp;rsquo;s generators could become a vital part of energy production and management, or even revolutionize our relationship with energy entirely.
The Bloom Energy Server originated from a NASA project aimed at generating air and fuel from electricity for Mars expeditions.</description></item><item><title>Even If There Is No Global Warming</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/even-if-there-is-no-global-warming/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Apr 2024 23:55:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/even-if-there-is-no-global-warming/</guid><description>The debate surrounding climate change is heating up, with strong opinions on both sides. Whether or not human activity is the primary driver of global warming, shifting towards green energy makes sense for a multitude of reasons. We need to change our approach to energy consumption or face serious consequences, potentially even sooner than anticipated.
The current economic downturn has provided a temporary reprieve in energy consumption, but as the economy recovers, the demand for oil will surge.</description></item><item><title>The Green Energy Fairy Tale is Real</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-green-energy-fairy-tale-is-real/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jun 2023 05:42:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-green-energy-fairy-tale-is-real/</guid><description>For decades, we&amp;rsquo;ve been promised a utopian future powered by clean energy sources like solar, wind, and fusion. This ideal world, fueled by boundless energy, feels perpetually out of reach, forcing us to rely on polluting coal and oil.
This is absurd. We possess the technology to transition away from fossil fuels immediately.
Our obstacle isn&amp;rsquo;t technological, but mental. We cling to the misconception that clean energy is impractical, a belief so deeply rooted that we accept it without question.</description></item><item><title>Eco Friendly Hosting $3.75/mo.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/eco-friendly-hosting-375mo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Feb 2023 05:23:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/eco-friendly-hosting-375mo/</guid><description>As Earth Day approaches, you might feel uneasy about using a web host that relies on electricity from a coal-powered plant, further consuming energy for server cooling.
