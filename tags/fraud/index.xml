The study showed that while the EMV chip card standard has reduced in-person fraud, online fraud is on the rise. Merchants and retailers are planning to significantly increase their investments in payments to improve customer experience (a 50% increase compared to 2015)...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/in-asia-cards-account-for-52-of-payments-but-there-are-new-emerging-payment-tools/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/in-asia-cards-account-for-52-of-payments-but-there-are-new-emerging-payment-tools/</a></p></description></item><item><title>India no longer accepts high denomination notes in the current series</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/india-no-longer-accepts-high-denomination-notes-in-the-current-series/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jul 2023 04:59:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/india-no-longer-accepts-high-denomination-notes-in-the-current-series/</guid><description>India&amp;rsquo;s Reserve Bank (RBI) has decided to discontinue the use of 500 and 1,000 rupee notes. These notes ceased to be legal tender as of November 9, 2016. Consequently, ATMs and other cash transaction machines were shut down on November 9 and 10. However, bank branches and government treasuries remained open on November 10.
This move was prompted by the difficulty in differentiating real banknotes from counterfeit ones.

Contrary to popular belief, fraud against the EU budget is not typically committed by corrupt EU officials. As per EU reports, the usual culprits are individuals or companies exploiting EU funds managed by Member States. These violations also extend beyond spending to include EU income reduction, such as evading customs duties on imports.
Establishing and upholding EU-wide regulations for such misconduct has been challenging. However, the Court of Justice (CJEU) significantly strengthened the law in this area with its recent Taricco judgment...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-bolsters-criminal-law-protection-of-the-eu-s-finances-in-the-italian-job/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-cjeu-bolsters-criminal-law-protection-of-the-eu-s-finances-in-the-italian-job/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Two perspectives on Taricco II: Criminal law, human rights, and constitutional pluralism.</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/two-perspectives-on-taricco-ii-criminal-law-human-rights-and-constitutional-pluralism/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Apr 2023 03:04:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/two-perspectives-on-taricco-ii-criminal-law-human-rights-and-constitutional-pluralism/</guid><description>The never-ending legal case, Jarndyce and Jarndyce, drags on. Over time, this meaningless case has become so convoluted that nobody understands it.

Countless children have been born into this case, young people have married into it, and the elderly have died during it.

The EU&amp;rsquo;s proposed European Public Prosecutor&amp;rsquo;s Office (EPPO) has sparked significant debate among Member States. The EPPO&amp;rsquo;s role would be to investigate and prosecute fraudulent use of EU funds, with discussions already underway to expand its jurisdiction to include terrorism and other serious crimes. Current political dialogue centers around the necessity of this supranational entity and the potential impact on national sovereignty, particularly within the sensitive realm of criminal justice...<p>Read The Full Article :<a href="https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-european-public-prosecutor-s-office-and-fundamental-rights-a-disquieting-lack-of-discussion/">https://Nexus-Security.github.io/the-european-public-prosecutor-s-office-and-fundamental-rights-a-disquieting-lack-of-discussion/</a></p></description></item><item><title>Fake clicks and pageviews can artificially boost digital marketing metrics</title><link>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/fake-clicks-and-pageviews-can-artificially-boost-digital-marketing-metrics/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Sep 2022 00:51:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Nexus-Security.github.io/fake-clicks-and-pageviews-can-artificially-boost-digital-marketing-metrics/</guid><description>You&amp;rsquo;ve invested in online ads on a platform known for its excellent results, and you&amp;rsquo;re seeing those clicks increase week after week.
